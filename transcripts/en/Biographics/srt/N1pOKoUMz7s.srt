let's get into it.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,220
Mohandas Gandhi started out as a scared,

9
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,870
painfully shy young man,

10
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,960
yet he was transformed by injustice,

11
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,610
to step beyond his insecurities to become
the 20th century's most influential

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:34,611
champion of social justice and the
standard bearer for nonviolent resistance.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,660
Here's example of humility.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,920
Courage and quiet.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,630
Dignity has inspired millions and it's
been the catalyst for that change to a

16
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,464
better world.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,030
In this week's biographics,

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,750
we discovered the inspirational
story of the great soul,

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,980
Mahatma Gandhi.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,073
Okay.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,251
Mahindras Comma.

22
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:08,251
John Gandy was born on October the
second 1869 in the coastal Indian town of

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,430
Poor Bandar.

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,170
He was the youngest of six children,

25
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,800
which included two half sisters
from his father's previous marriage.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,400
Monjas.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,030
His father,

28
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,720
[inaudible] was the Dijuan or
political leader of Paul Bandha.

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,270
His mother put Levi,

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,420
was deeply religious,

31
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,880
impressing strong Hindu
beliefs on her children.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,211
Could.

33
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:25,631
I'm trans,

34
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,040
provided well for his family.

35
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:31,910
He lived in a three story house and
it's seven the Honduras was known by all

36
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:32,800
lists Mohammed.

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,250
He was especially devoted to his
mother who he considered to be a saint.

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,370
Her piety made a deep impression upon him.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,150
When the boy was five his
father was appointed the
chief minister of the smaller

40
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,060
inland city of ranch
caught after two years.

41
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:46,960
The family that you joined him,

42
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:49,300
that one was a painfully shy Charles.

43
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,080
He kept to himself at school
when it's Besson's with Don,

44
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,450
he would run home in order to avoid
having to talk to any of his peers.

45
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,860
He was also a fearful child who
was terrified of many things,

46
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,630
but especially the dark.

47
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,230
He found his solace in books
which were if something,

48
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:08,740
if a constant companion when he was
just seven years of age and this was the

49
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:09,511
Hindu costume.

50
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:14,511
Mohan became engaged to Casta muck Hangi
[inaudible] who was a few months older

51
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:15,070
than him.

52
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,240
The arranged marriage was completed when
Mohan turned 13 the planning for the

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,350
lavish wedding ceremony and adjustment
to married life meant that he had to take

54
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,670
a year off from his schooling.

55
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,620
He was an average student at best,

56
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:28,780
though he tried hard
to please as teachers,

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,040
you have no interest in sports games or
social activities with any of his peers.

58
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,640
He did,

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,240
however,

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
make one friends around this time.

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,210
He wasn't Muslim boy by the name of
shake Mahtab Jake was old Zuarin's more

62
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,440
street smart than Mohammed.

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,900
It was also physically
larger and stronger than him.

64
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,320
He tried in Mohan about his frail
condition and it's holding this.

65
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,160
If he ate meat,

66
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,140
he would get to much bigger and stronger.

67
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,380
No,

68
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,680
this was strictly
against the Hindu belief,

69
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,140
especially.

70
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,400
Mohan met his friend in secret one day
and he had his first taste of meat even

71
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:01,300
though they caused him to vomit he to
eat it for the next year without letting

72
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,230
anyone else know.

73
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,560
During that period shakes hook
into a brothel and experience,

74
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,890
which was an embarrassing disaster
for the impressionable team.

75
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,640
Realizing that shake was
a bit of a bad influence.

76
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:16,060
He caught off association with him and
returns to a strict vegetarian diet.

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,350
Bowen's father calm John's died
when the boy was 16 years old.

78
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,410
The grief was compounded when Bon and
Costa was first child died less than a

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,690
week old.

80
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,960
The couple would go on to have four more
children with the first being born in

81
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,370
1880 8 million completed college at the
age of 18 and enrolled in some Aldous

82
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:33,940
college.

83
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,390
However,

84
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,830
he disliked the lecture style of
teaching and dropped out after only a few

85
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:38,890
months.

86
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,850
He had set his sights on becoming a lawyer
and eventually becoming a Duwan like

87
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,530
his father.

88
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,570
A family friends suggested that he should
go to England to study where it was

89
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,710
easier to pass the bar.

90
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,240
It was agreed that this would be the best
course of on the Shy Hindu boy was now

91
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,310
headed for the bright lights of London

92
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,070
on August the 10th 1880 8 million left
his family including his wife and his one

93
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:09,090
month old son [inaudible] and he
headed for Bombay where he bought it.

94
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:10,530
A ship that was bound for London.

95
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,250
Before leaving though he was something
to be the leader of his cost to warns him

96
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,270
that if he went to England,

97
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,520
he would be tempted to
break the rules of Hinduism.

98
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,030
He was told to either abandoned his plans,

99
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:22,230
will be excommunicated from the cost.

100
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,220
Gandhi accepted this consequence
and he continued upon his way.

101
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,700
Fitting into Western culture though was
that it was a shock to the 18 year olds,

102
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,420
everything.

103
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,470
It was so different,

104
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,060
so what he had known back in India,

105
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,661
it's still,

106
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,880
he did his best to fit
in buying a fine suit,

107
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,350
complete with a leather gloves,

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,000
top hat and Silvertips cane.

109
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,260
He also paid for lessons and
elocution manners and dumps.

110
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,410
His biggest challenge was
with regard to his diet.

111
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,770
He had vowed to his mother that
he was not going to eat meat,

112
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,980
but he was finding it very difficult
to find restaurants that cater to

113
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:53,940
vegetarians.

114
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,330
His chronic shyness prevented
him from requesting alternatives,

115
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,180
do what was on offer.

116
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:01,590
That finally though you found a
vegetarian restaurants along with a whole

117
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:05,430
community of vegetarians and it was at
this point so that he joins the nuns and

118
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,780
vegetarian society.

119
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,840
Just wait as difficulties with
fitting into London in life.

120
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,430
Gandhi did well academically.

121
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,440
He passed his law exams in June of 1891
his friends at the vegetarian society,

122
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,750
they held a celebrator
evening and is on it.

123
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,280
When it came time to give a speech.

124
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:20,671
However,

125
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:24,480
Mohan was so nervous that he
simply rose and Tony said,

126
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,643
thank you.

127
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,663
Okay

128
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,450
on is returned to India.

129
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:35,500
Mohan was met at Bombay harbor by his
older brother who bought some terrible

130
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,070
news,

131
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,760
his mother,

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,550
but Levi had died in his absence moons.

133
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:42,730
Grief was compounded with the
consequences of his overseas foray.

134
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,260
He was now disfellowshipped from his cost
in order to please his family members.

135
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:51,100
He agreed to bathe in a sacred river
in order to wash away the sins of

136
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,640
England's.

137
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,120
This precipitated his
reentry into the cost going.

138
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,740
Z books for work is a lawyer in Bombay.

139
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,131
However,

140
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,880
his chronic shyness was still preventing
him from making any advancements.

141
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,410
He recalls how he fell is presenting his
first case before the court saying my

142
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,620
head was reeling and it felt as if
the whole court was doing likewise.

143
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,090
He retreats it to the nes
imposing town of Raj Carlton,

144
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,670
just stablish to a small law office that
shortly thereafter he received an offer

145
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,980
from the much and two had
been a friend of his father.

146
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,220
This man was now based in South Africa
and he needed a lawyer to help with the

147
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:22,970
court case.

148
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,210
The year long job was often
to Gandhi and he accepted it.

149
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,280
Just finished recently
becoming a father again.

150
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,630
He kept his wife and two young sons
under the camera of his brother and he

151
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:37,631
headed off a Durban South Africa in April
of 1893 officer settling into his new

152
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,691
surroundings,

153
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:38,931
guns.

154
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,770
He took the trains,

155
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,140
Pretoria where the court
case was to be tried.

156
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,940
He purchased a first cost ticket.

157
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,510
However,

158
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,490
on one of the stops the
European men bolted,

159
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,450
the car that he was in,

160
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,680
the men resented seeing an Indian and
first costs and left to find the train

161
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,310
conductor.

162
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,770
The two men returned and has gone.

163
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,270
D was wanting to go down
to the third class section.

164
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,841
God's.

165
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:00,740
He showed them his fitness costs
tickets and refuse to move or to that's

166
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,040
trained.

167
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,560
Security was cooled and gum
dia was kicked off the train.

168
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,590
He had to go to the rest of the
way in a horse drawn carriage.

169
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,281
However,

170
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,810
the white passengers of that carriage,

171
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:12,620
they refuse to lessen Indians it inside
with them and he was made to sit on the

172
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,640
outside foot board.

173
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,750
He lays it recalls.

174
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,290
The insult was more than I could bat.

175
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,660
This was the watershed experience of my
hundred Gandhi's life as if by miracle

176
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,890
he shook off his timid nature and stepped
forward as a leader of the oppressed.

177
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,420
When he arrived in Pretoria,

178
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,930
he called a meeting of the
Indian community and gave
the funniest speech of his

179
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:36,440
life cooling for the Indians
to stand up for their rights.

180
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,600
Once his work on the
court case was completed,

181
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,200
Gandhi decided to stay and continue
to fight the Indian rights.

182
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,260
In 1894 he established the natal Indian
Congress to give Indians a political

183
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,190
voice.

184
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,100
He established himself as a leader in
the local community giving free legal

185
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,870
advice and offering support.

186
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,510
In 1896 off to three
years in South Africa.

187
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:56,931
Gandhi,

188
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:59,150
writtens India to connect his family.

189
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,920
It returned with his wife and two sons
who are now aged nine and five along with

190
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:04,610
a nephew.

191
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,980
Gandhi demanded that his family,

192
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,440
they dress as Europeans and eat with
knives and forks as it was the way with

193
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,760
Indians in South Africa.

194
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,920
This goal tension within his family.

195
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,160
Still two more songs were added to
the family and the coming years.

196
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,830
When the bow Walbro accounts
in 1899 Gandhi fell to this.

197
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,740
If the Indian supported the government,

198
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,870
they would be rewarded
with that or treatments.

199
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,220
He organized an Indian ambulance corps
who are a valuable asset to the army,

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,233
but the loyalty,

201
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,280
it wins unrewarded with the
harsh treatment continuing
during this time gone.

202
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:35,240
D develops the life philosophy,

203
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,910
which was to going in for
the remainder of his days.

204
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,800
They called it [inaudible],

205
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,870
which means devotion to the truth.

206
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,960
The three core tenants of the
belief where noncooperation,

207
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,300
nonviolence and non possession.

208
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,520
In 1906 the South African province of
Transvaal enacted a law that required all

209
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:55,440
Indians to register and
be given identity cards.

210
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,920
The police were allowed to stop and
demand their registration as any time.

211
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,800
No other group have this requirement.

212
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,500
Guns he advocated the use of
saw Takahata counsel the law.

213
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,600
He told people not to register.

214
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,411
As a result,

215
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:07,771
he ends.

216
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,510
Many others were thrown in jail,

217
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:13,170
but Gandhi taught that righteous
imprisonments was an honorable thing.

218
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,160
The concept of Satyagraha took hold
and Gandia established a number of

219
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,390
cytochromes settlements.

220
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,770
The people in the settlements,

221
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,420
they practiced non possession,

222
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,300
living a simple and austere life guns.

223
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,710
He also organized a large coal miners'
strike the men practice noncooperation by

224
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,790
refusing to work and nonviolence by
refusing to react when they were attacked

225
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,810
spinal authorities.

226
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,580
In July of 1914 the South
African government passed
the Indian really fact which

227
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,420
wins some way to righting the wrongs
that had been heaped upon the Indian

228
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,050
community.

229
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,280
The 20 years of struggle that
Gandhi had put into the cause.

230
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,250
We're largely responsible for these
changes and after this he was ready to

231
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,330
return to India,

232
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,340
bringing his philosophy with him.

233
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,560
And do you know what else he
brought back to India with him?

234
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,480
His famous glosses?

235
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:57,781
Yes,

236
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,160
I absolutely just did that.

237
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:04,110
Welcome to an unexpected Abrie brought
to you by glasses USA and you can,

238
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:08,360
there's a gandy wish they existed back
when he wold glosses because fat just

239
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:08,910
excellent.

240
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,810
These ones that could,

241
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:10,321
would les,

242
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:14,100
and I've also got two others that
you see me wearing from time to time.

243
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:15,780
There's one this,

244
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,070
there's also a bigger pair,

245
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,620
which I don't have all
my little table here,

246
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,230
but you can also get them in
a whole bunch of other styles.

247
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,400
They've got a huge range.

248
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,640
Some 4,000 options are available.

249
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:26,821
Then,

250
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:26,971
Hey,

251
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,590
they've also got designer sunglasses.

252
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:31,620
You saw me wearing these at
the beginning of the video.

253
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,240
Now this isn't actually
on the talking points,

254
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,640
but I believe what is perhaps
the biggest testament,

255
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,570
the glasses USA,

256
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,750
is that this is my second
pair of sunglasses from them.

257
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,680
A few months ago,

258
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,870
I lost a power while I was
on holiday and by lost,

259
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,050
I mean I literally flushed them
down the toilet by accident.

260
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,370
I really couldn't be making this stuff
up and I had such a good experience with

261
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,860
glasses USA that I just went
on the Internet and bought
the same identical path.

262
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,960
They already had my prescription.

263
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,070
I just plugged it in
and I bought a new pair.

264
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,990
That's exactly the same.

265
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,030
I think that really says a
lot about how great it is.

266
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,660
You can also try them on online with a
virtual mirror and the best thing of all,

267
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,580
it's super affordable glasses USA.

268
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,150
They cut out the middleman giving you
prescription glasses and up to 70% off

269
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,100
retail and frames and lenses.

00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:15,690
They start at just $30 plus a seat by
quality lenses that every good as bit as

271
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,790
my old glasses that I had ages ago.

272
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,450
They were overpriced and just not
as good and if you're not happy,

273
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,380
you can just send them back.

277
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,910
Let's get back to Gandhi
and his non glasses.

278
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,080
USA specs.

279
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,350
Ooh,

280
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,660
gums or you were surprised to receive
a hero's welcome back to India.

281
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,680
His efforts on behalf of South African
Indians had been well reported over the

282
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,670
years and Indian poet referred to him
as Mahatma meaning great souls and the

283
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:56,671
names are cold as a sign of the shy
young man who had left in 1893 written

284
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:01,951
didn't 1915 as a leader and he was a
leader with a mission and that of course

285
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,630
was Indian self rule.

286
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,340
Gandhi also challenged his own people
to look at the unfair treatments within

287
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,210
their own culture.

288
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,470
He challenged the cost system and
especially the terrible treatments of the

289
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,930
lowest class known as the untouchables.

290
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,920
He established a said Gog Raha settlements
in which the people spun yarn and

291
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,280
farmed free trees gone.

292
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:25,840
The accepted on touchables into this
community and taught the local peasants

293
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:30,520
proper hygiene and encouraged factory
workers to wage peaceful strikes against

294
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,200
the unfair working conditions.

295
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,310
Despite his belief in nonviolence gone.

296
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,150
D did support the British war
effort during World War One.

297
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,051
The wars ends,

298
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:41,590
the government Pasternack's making it
illegal for any group to organize and

299
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,090
oppositions and the government's gone.

300
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:47,080
Z equals for a mass strikes at
protest the Lawrence for one day,

301
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,240
the whole of India came to a standstill.

302
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,870
It was clear evidence of
the power there's gone.

303
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,240
Dee was able to wield yes when reports
filtered in that some Indians had

304
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,910
resorted to violence on the
day of peaceful protest.

305
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,620
He was bitterly disappointed.

306
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,500
He knew at that point
that as people as a whole,

307
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,890
we're not ready for sat gog Gra now the
British were concerned that there would

308
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,630
be further outbreaks of violence.

309
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:11,740
And so a law was passed banning any
gatherings of Indians in the city of

310
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,603
Amritsar.

311
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,450
One of the places where von instead of
cut the following day was the beginning

312
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,500
of the religious new year.

313
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,450
And about 10,000 people
gathered in the town square.

314
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,010
They have not yet how the news of
the band as they were a piece for the

315
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,620
listening to a speech 90
soldiers and to Almond,

317
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:27,850
Dot.

318
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,660
They blocked off the only
exit and proceeded to father
weapons into the unarmed

319
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,500
crowd of men,

320
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,940
women and children.

321
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,030
379 people were killed that day with
more than a thousand words being wounded.

322
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,480
In 1920 you're Ganti became the leader
of the Indian national congress.

323
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,650
Advocating is nonviolent resistance
and instituting strikes and boycotts to

324
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:57,190
bring pressure on the system gone and
he told the people to boycott of British

325
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,240
cloth and spin their own IV out to spend
time spinning every day and took to

326
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,580
wearing clothing made of hand spun cloth.

327
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,960
He made the spinning wheel and
national symbol of Indian independence.

328
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,350
Goldade traveled throughout the massive
countryside going mostly on foot.

329
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,160
He lives with the downtrodden in their
makeshift to dwellings and listened to

330
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:15,910
their problems.

331
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,480
To them.

332
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,660
He was a saintly figure as
they refer to him as babble,

333
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,890
meaning father.

334
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,490
In March 90 22 guards,

335
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,920
he was arrested for sedition.

336
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,700
The trial gave him the platform to expound
upon the unfair treatment of Indians

337
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,400
and his refusal to
cooperate with unjust laws.

338
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,301
These in guilty,

339
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,250
he was sentenced to six years in prison.

340
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,300

using his time of confinement of read

341
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,640
and study off two years he was released.

342
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,330
His focus was now on creating
harmony between induce and Muslims.

343
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,111
For centuries,

344
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:47,920
the two groups had been at loggerheads
with one another with Vaughn and clashes

345
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:48,880
often breaking out.

346
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,910
Gandhi saw that independence would be
impossible without unity and he was

347
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:55,220
determined to bring these
two groups together.

348
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,240
Gandhi undertook a hunger fast as a
tool to bring the Hindus and the Muslims

349
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,620
together for three weeks.

350
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,710
He only drank water as they're
bad people grew weaker by the day.

351
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:08,270
The Hindus and Muslims finally agreed to
put aside their differences in order to

352
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,550
stop suffering.

353
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,493
Okay.

354
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,810
On march the 12th 1930 guarantee began
a month long track from his Ashram and

355
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,370
under batch to the seed.

356
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,840
Hundreds and then thousands of followers
of all religions and costs is joins him

357
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,674
along the way.

358
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,670
News of the march.

359
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,650
If fill papers around the world,

360
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,030
the British had long imposed a law
making it illegal for anyone to make salt

361
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:34,180
from seawater in India.

362
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,051
As a result,

363
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,990
they were able to make huge
profits from their salt tax.

364
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,220
24 days after setting out
on his march to the sea,

365
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,620
Gandy Arrive Dondhi on
the Gulf coast of Cambay.

366
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,640
The following morning,

367
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:49,240
Gandhi walked out into the sea
water to bathe on Ezra town.

368
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,720
He picks up a handful of salts
in defiance of the salt act.

369
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,940
This act was a signal for his countryman
and up and down India's coastline.

370
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,970
Thousands of others began collecting
seawater in order to make and sell salt.

371
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,550
Many were arrested,

372
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:04,331
including Gandhi,

373
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,130
who was thrown in prison
for a second time.

374
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,990
You had the British could not silence.

375
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:11,500
Mahatma officials now realize that
this man held a powerful sway over the

376
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:12,070
masses.

377
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,350
He simply could not be ignored any longer.

378
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,640
The more the British government,

379
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,330
both in India and at home were being
pressured by other governments to release

380
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,260
Gandhi from jail.

381
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,150
Finally the British Viceroy in India.

382
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,390
Daughter when met with Gandhi
after lengthy discussion,

383
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:26,650
they came to a truce,

384
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:26,940
gone.

385
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,750
D would cool off the demonstrations.

386
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,650
The prisoners would will be released and
Indians would be allowed to make their

387
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:33,484
own salts.

388
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,890
In 1931 Gandhi traveled to London to
represent the Indian national congress as

389
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,090
an international round table conference.

390
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,090
He called for Indian
independence from Britain.

391
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,343
You can pinned,

392
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,231
done that.

393
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,064
We run

394
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,590
rather than mixed with the other
delegates in their five star hotels gone.

395
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:54,310
The stayed with an old friend and spent
his days walking around the slums,

396
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:58,960
dressed in his traditional whom spawn
Cottey and his sandals he will is by now

397
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,940
the famous international figure runs.

398
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,840
Newsreels of his visits were shown in
movie theaters all around the world.

399
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,700
Surely after returning to India,

400
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:15,790
Gandhi was again arrested for
inciting civil disobedience.

401
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,900
While he was in prison,

402
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,470
the British government passed a law that
discriminated against the untouchables

403
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,580
and court proceedings.

404
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,400
Gonzi was infuriated,

405
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:27,310
doesn't announce that he would not eat
until this law was revoked fairing,

406
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,550
that his death would create a martyrdom
that would doom them in the eyes of the

407
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,120
welds.

408
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,470
The authorities caved in.

409
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,860
The law was rescinded when
Britain declared war on Germany.

410
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:40,600
In 1939 Gandhi told the authorities that
Indians would only join the war fs if

411
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,640
they were promised their independence.

412
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,511
Three years later,

413
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:46,240
he started a quit India
movement as always,

414
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,600
the plans for the
campaign to be nonviolent,

415
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,800
especially things soon got out of hands
and riots broke out across the country.

416
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,650
The authorities blamed
Gandhians one small,

417
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,730
he was thrown in jail.

418
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,720
His beloved wife,

419
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:58,211
Christa,

420
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,490
was also imprisoned at this time and age.

421
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,590
She soon became ill,

422
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,550
dying in custody.

423
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:06,840
On February the 22nd 1944
following his wife's death,

424
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,820
Gandhi grew weak with malaria.

425
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,200
The authorities agreed to release him
then may of 1944 and he went to Bombay to

426
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,080
recover and recuperate
the end of World War II.

427
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,180
Saw great person on its
knees though Victoria,

428
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,400
since it's spent exorbitant amounts in
the war efforts and now no longer have

429
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:23,881
the results,

430
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:27,370
is to maintain its role within India
with little choice in the massive person

431
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,890
offered India its independence.

432
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,150
It was the grand victory that Gandhi
had been fighting for for the past 30

433
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:33,780
years.

434
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,090
Even though the nation was
now free to rule itself,

435
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:41,010
India was still plagues with deep division
between Hindus and most of them's the

436
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:44,430
only solution seemed to be to
divide the country up and do Hindu,

437
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,530
India and most of them Pakistan.

438
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,610
This was a move that was greatly
displeasing to Gandhi who loaned the unity

439
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,930
between these two groups.

440
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,030
In the weeks following
the creation of Pakistan,

441
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:58,050
there were violence clashes
between Muslims and Hindus
up and down the country.

442
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,760
Massek as a could throughout 1947 with
both sides being equally responsible for

443
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:03,540
the bloodshed.

444
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,440
Hundreds of thousands of people died and
there were riots in most of the major

445
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,220
cities.

446
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,170
On January the 13th of 1948 the 78 year
old gone day began the fost in order to

447
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:14,370
get the madness to stop.

448
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
He was so despondent that he
refused to even drink water.

449
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,980
Despite the physical pain that he was in.

450
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,120
He still lead a pram.

451
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:25,590
Meeting from his bet is wads were
broadcast around the entire country.

452
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,510
Five days into his fost.

453
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,750
Muslim and Hindu leaders
agreed to a piece of court.

454
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,571
However,

455
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:41,320
Gandhi was still very concerned about
the direction the fledgling nation was

456
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:41,830
taking.

457
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,090
The new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru
was constantly at odds with his deputy

458
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:47,840
Vallabhbhai Patel and gone.

459
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,840
Z counseled both men to make peace.

460
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,940
On January the 30th 1948 he was in a
meeting with Patel just after 5:00 PM he

461
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:56,650
came out into the gods and a bill,

462
00:19:56,651 --> 00:20:00,670
a house in Delhi to offer prowess
weakened from his recent Fasti,

463
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,930
leans on two of his followers for support
as he walks a crowd of some 500 people

464
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:09,190
were waiting to greet him as he made his
way to the platform or Hindu extremist

465
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,790
Angus Gandhi's leniency towards
the Muslims snapped forward.

466
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,350
He bowed before the Mahatma and then
pulled out a pistol and fired three shots

467
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,940
and succession of pointblank
range within half an hour.

468
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,300
The last breath of life.

469
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:26,170
It seeped out of his body and
the great soul with no more.

470
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,360
When he had the news of Mahatmas death,

471
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,990
the prime minister stated the light
has gone out of our lives and there is

472
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:33,010
darkness everywhere.

473
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,250
Hundreds.

474
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,430
Gandhi was a light,

475
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,080
not just to the people of India,

476
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:39,820
but those of the entire wells.

477
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,110
His funeral procession through the streets
of Delhi was attended by more than 2

478
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,270
million people and years after his death,

479
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:47,320
countless of the millions,

480
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:50,920
including a young Baptist minister
from Georgia named Martin Luther King,

481
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,970
would find inspiration in
his words and in his legacy.

482
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,740
So I really hope you found that video.

483
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,341
