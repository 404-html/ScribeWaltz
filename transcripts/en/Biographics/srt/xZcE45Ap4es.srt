1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,410
Night of being photographed
shirtless and alongside wild animals,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,741
rabbits.

3
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:04,574
At the same time,

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,600
Vladimir Putin,

5
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:09,710
he's cultivated an image
as an intimidating and
fearless figure on the world

6
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,400
stage.

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,780
He's a martial arts expert,

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,840
but fearless political actor and a former
spy is resume holds a certain cachet

9
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,330
in the west.

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,850
As a former KGB agents,

11
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,610
he's automatically
associated with secrecy,

12
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,660
intimidation,

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,750
and the old fears Americans had of the
Soviet Union for much of the 21st century

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,330
policing instead of himself that he
lives in long time as an ordinary person,

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,960
ordinary Ms. all he
wishes to be for decades,

16
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:39,950
though he hasn't been anything but
ordinary as he spent his life climbing the

17
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:44,000
ranks of the Russian government's
moving farther and farther away from his

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,050
ordinary roots.

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,120
He was born in Saint Petersburg in
1957 in the midst of the Cold War.

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:03,720
Putin,

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,950
he had two older brothers,

22
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,380
but unfortunately both
died during childhood,

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,333
so Puson,

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,440
he was raised essentially
as an only child.

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,120
He was an atheist as a child,

26
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,790
but today he's an eastern
Orthodox Christian.

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,110
During Putin's childhood,

28
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,060
his mother stayed at home and his father,

29
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,320
a veteran of world war two,

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,780
worked in a factory as an
interesting aside here,

31
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,990
his grandfather was a cook.

32
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:27,840
He works for Vladimir Lenin and even
prepared meals for stolen a few times the

33
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:28,531
pigeon family.

34
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,730
They lived in a communal apartment
shared by three families,

35
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,160
a home where Putin says he used
to hunt rats in the stairwell.

36
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,540
Perhaps a precursor to you is later
fascination with hunting Manz with wild

37
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,374
animals in general.

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,953
No,

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,170
no.

40
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,980
Growing up,

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,030
it didn't prove himself to be anything
particularly special in his early years,

42
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,680
but then by the age of 12 he
discovered athletic competition.

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,310
It was in the midst of a competition
that Putin began to set himself apart.

44
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,470
Martial arts was his chosen sport,

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,900
particularly sambo and judo.

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,470
Though his mother did not
initially approve of his
participation in these sports

47
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,000
boots and proved himself to be a
worthy and skilled competitor in both.

48
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,810
At one point,

49
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,050
his coach even showed up at the pigs and
home to speak with his mother about how

50
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,700
much promise that image showed.

51
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:16,971
Well,

52
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,270
I was actually that the did the trick
and his parents began to support his

53
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:21,560
athletic pursuits.

54
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,910
These in now holds a black belt in judo
and just continued to compete in both

55
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,110
sambo and judo,

56
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,580
establishing himself as the first world
leader to be at an advanced level in

57
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:32,360
these sports.

58
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,410
He also remains the presidents at the
same Dojo he practiced in while growing up

59
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,580
though he established himself
as athletically talented person,

60
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,890
did not excel academically in
school during his challenges.

61
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,730
He attended a local school for his early
years and then attended a magnet school

62
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,140
focused on chemistry.

63
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,550
He didn't push himself,

64
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,140
but his teacher saw that he did have
potential and they encouraged him to focus

65
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,830
as much on his school work as he
did on his martial arts practice.

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,110
It was in the sixth grade when really
began to push himself and that showed in

67
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,800
his grades.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,050
He was welcomed to the Young Pioneers,

69
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,480
the youth group that was
run by the Communist Party.

70
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,530
This was a serious mark of honor is pizza
and had previously been one of only a

71
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,460
few from the class who had
not been welcomed into the
organization now from 1970

72
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,050
to 1975 feet in,

73
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,440
continued his studies at some
Petersburg State University.

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,160
While there he studied law and was
required to join the communist party.

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,760
He later left the posse
denouncing communism in 1991.

76
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,820
When he said of Marxism Leninism this,

77
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,510
it became more and more obvious for me,

78
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,270
more obvious that it was nothing more
than a beautiful and harmful fairytale in

79
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,140
Petersburg state university pten.

80
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:42,490
Matt's Anatoly Sobchak who would become
a key figure in Putin's political

81
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,324
success.

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,760
Self check was an assistant
professor at the school,

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,440
but he actually went on to co author the
constitution of the Russian Federation

84
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,350
and was also the first democratically
elected mayor of some Peter's though.

85
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,253
Okay.

86
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,200
Who's in graduated from Saint Petersburg
State University in 1975 and it was

87
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,580
then that he joined the KGB.

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,810
KGB was the Soviet Union Security
Agency for much of the 20th century.

89
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,990
It was created in 1954 and continued to
operate until 1991 when the Soviet Union

90
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:18,680
itself was dismantles.

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,090
It translated to English.

92
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,210
KGB stands for state security committee.

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,950
It has a reputation for oppression and
monitoring the actions and opinions of

94
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:28,970
Soviet citizens.

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,690
KGB.

96
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,130
It was a truly frightening organization
for democracy as an indication of the

97
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,120
dangers of communism to Westerners,

98
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,690
the organization rebellions and kept a
close eye on anyone suspected to be an

99
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,870
opposition to the Soviet regime who
didn't started his career with the KGB in

100
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:45,870
Leningrad boss.

101
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,510
He was a to move to do Dresden,

102
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,760
Germany before was transferred to Germany.

103
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,710
Putin married to this very day.

104
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:55,370
Putin keeps his home life are very private
and information about his family is

105
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:56,570
very closely guarded.

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,470
He and his wife lived.

107
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,370
Millard were married from 1983
until the divorce in 2013,

108
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,140
that divorce that was seemingly amicable
with no specific reason given for it

109
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,840
though Lynn Miller made references to
Putin's dedication to his work and the

110
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,420
time investment required
to serve as a world leader.

111
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,620
They have two daughters together,

112
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,150
Maria and tax arena,

113
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,940
both of whose lives
remain incredibly secrets.

114
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,960
They both used fake names to go and
register for college and it's not entirely

115
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:25,820
known in which country either of the
daughters currently lives in 2016 European

116
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:30,140
newspapers even described and Maria as a
secret daughter noticing if she had not

117
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,830
been willing to be photographed during
the entire length of Putin's time and

118
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:36,530
power for a former spy
and they man with many,

119
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:37,311
many enemies.

120
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:41,630
It's sensible that his daughters have
maintains this secret life who didn't

121
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:45,560
indeed a status either private life
in which I do not permit interference.

122
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,540
It must be respected,

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,020
so pretend he moved with his family to

124
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,780
Dresden where he served
with the KGB for five years.

125
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,290
He was fluent in German and still
speaks this language to this day.

126
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,530
Auntie stated that he actually feels more
comfortable using German than English.

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,110
Putin served in this dresden
posts from 1985 to 1990,

128
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,640
working as an undercover agents
playing the part of a translator.

129
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,180
The work,

130
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,280
though not all of our
peers in the dead is known.

131
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,450
It was the spy after all,

132
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,310
it wasn't particularly interesting.

133
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,910
Much of it was simply amassing
information on people,

134
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,020
ensuring that they remain
loyal to the Soviet.

135
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,210
Some we're not passing
any kind of revolution.

136
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,410
In 1999,

137
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:31,950
though the situation it became rather
than more dicey for Soviet see were

138
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:35,580
stationed in Dresden during one incident
as it became more and more clear that

139
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:35,961
he's German,

140
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,830
he was falling out of Soviet control.

141
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,210
Putin and his colleagues feared for
their lives as crowds stormed the KGB

142
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,410
headquarters in Dresden.

143
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,020
Booty calls in the Soviet
military for how the birds.

144
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,260
He was told that nothing could be done
for them and less Moscow gave the order

145
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,090
something that Moscow never did.

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,380
While Putin and his colleagues well,

147
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,310
they survived that day,

148
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:58,020
it has become increasingly clear that
the situation was unstable during this

149
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:58,350
time.

150
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,460
Putin ends of the KGB.

151
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,710
Agents began burning files so that when
the day came that their headquarters was

152
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,670
either taken or abandons or both,

153
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,160
no files would be left in
the hands of the enemy.

154
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,000
The Berlin Wall fell in November of 1989
and soon after Peyton and his family,

155
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,700
they returned to Russia by
this point piece in held.

156
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,500
The rank of lieutenant
colonel indicates beat,

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,760
however the KGB was nearing the end of
its existence and Putin was able to find

158
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:32,650
work at the State
University of some pieces.

159
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:33,190
Doug.

160
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,780
He was no ordinary professor.

161
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:35,080
They ate.

162
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,000
He was still working for the KGB,

163
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,810
part of his job included keeping an eye
out for students who showed promise as

164
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:43,970
potential new kgb
recruits through his job,

165
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:48,130
but he was also able to reconnect
with his former professor and Natalie.

166
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:48,964
Subject.

167
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,540
Subject,

168
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,160
he was elected the mayor of Pittsburgh
in 1991 and Putin joined his team as an

169
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:54,790
advisor.

170
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,680
He works for subject until 1996 when
subject last reelection losing could've

171
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,930
opted to continue working
for his successor,

172
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,590
but Putin believes that taking a job with
subjects political opponents would be

173
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:06,371
disloyal.

174
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:06,761
Anti.

175
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:10,210
Instead chose to move to Moscow to begin
working with the Yeltsin administrator.

176
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,410
During Boris Yeltsin presidency,

177
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,280
pten rose through the ranks first serving
as deputy chief administrative or the

178
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:25,810
Kremlin.

179
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,880
Russia is fashion of
the White House in 1999,

180
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,660
he was named secretary of the Security
Council and became Yeltsin's chief

181
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:35,240
advisor on matters of foreign
relations and intelligence,

182
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,530
but it was then the Putin's
Korea got a real real boost.

183
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,650
Yeltsin decided he didn't want to
keep his current prime minister,

184
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,910
so he got rid of him.

185
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,990
That was in August of 1999 and oh,

186
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,030
he was the beneficiary of this decision
as the eldest son named Vladimir Putin

187
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,950
and do the post Yeltsin offered Putin
the position of a prime minister with

188
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,790
prospects somewhat foreshadowing the
next step in Putin's Korea because it was

189
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,970
only months after naming buton is
prime minister Boris Yeltsin himself.

190
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,890
Steps down and Vladimir Putin became the
acting president of Russia and that was

191
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,840
in December of 1999.

192
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,250
Then three months later,

193
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,980
in March of 2015,

194
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,710
he was officially elected and became
president of Russia in his own

195
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,703
right.

196
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,580
10 opponents run against
him for president,

197
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,340
but he won nationals for the
first time in Russia's history.

198
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,810
There was a peaceful transfer of power
to a democratically elected presidents

199
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,530
who didn't.

200
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,700
He used his first time to advocate for
certain international policies including

201
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:41,630
approval of the start,

202
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:46,610
two arms treaty and improving relations
with China was also initially supportive

203
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:47,480
of the United States,

204
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,120
his war on terror that fully the
nine slash 11 terrorist attacks,

205
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,520
but he did not support the United States.

206
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:57,521
This invasion of Iraq during Putin's first
summer in power tragedy struck Russia

207
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,220
when the cask submarine sank
in the barren sea in August.

208
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,820
Please didn't.

209
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,850
He was on vacation when the sinking
your courage and he did not immediately

210
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:09,470
returned home to address the sinking and
the deaths of all 118 crew members who

211
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,340
had been on board.

212
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,770
Then when he was asked what
went wrong with the cask,

213
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Putin replied starkly that
it sank destroyers and angry
Russians were attacking

214
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:21,800
the president for his handling or like
they're all over the cask disaster with

215
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:25,280
some even accusing him of leaving sailors
to die when a rescue might've still

216
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:26,060
been possible.

217
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,320
That despite all of this opinion,

218
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:30,680
polls showed that overall his image
did not sustain much damage from the

219
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:31,310
tragedy.

220
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,760
Indeed,

221
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,630
four years later,

222
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,910
the cask tragedy did not
affect his reelection.

223
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:36,390
At all in 2004,

224
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,230
the Russians reelected him to
a second term as president,

225
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,970
and they were apparently
really pleased with the job.

226
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:43,710
He was doing his speech and received
over 70 percent of the volume

227
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,980
during his first term in office who's
head focused on economic reform,

228
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,170
having denounced communism.

229
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:02,970
He instead supported an economic system
that was essentially capitalism with

230
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,490
very strict regulations and oversight.

231
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,470
After years of economic struggle,

232
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,530
Russia was finally beginning to see a
stabilizing and even growing economy under

233
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,350
Putin.

234
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,951
Some reports,

235
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,890
but Russia's grief during his first
term at seven percent annually.

236
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,370
Indeed,

237
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,800
he still remembered
favorably for this growth,

238
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,300
though it came with increased
nationalization of industry
and in part because of

239
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,111
the mid two thousands,

240
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:26,340
global financial crash,

241
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,810
the grief did not last,

242
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,531
but in the country.

243
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:32,070
He's economy was in disarray for
nearly the entire decade before pten.

244
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,170
His rise to power and area of growth in
which disposable income nearly doubles

245
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,330
was reason for the people to think
really positively of Pearson.

246
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,370
Now Pearson did work on those economic
policies we already mentioned is fast

247
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:42,600
done,

248
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,070
but he also made strides in foreign
relations including making a historic trip

249
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,850
to Israel.

250
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,000
This was the first ever trip by
a Russian leader to the country.

251
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,190
Conversations between Putin and Israeli,

252
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,420
focused largely on security issues.

253
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,990
The tread gotten as much attention to
around the world as it came in the midst

254
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:01,810
of strengthening ties
between Russia and Israel.

255
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,160
Though the two nations disagreed on topics
such as the Russian side of missiles

256
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,994
to Syria,

257
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,090
the trip was also seen as a move by Putin
to help secure Russia's position as a

258
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:16,420
key diplomatic actor in any Middle
East peace discussions or agreements.

259
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:16,960
Now,

260
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,250
security issues were
present not just abroad,

261
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,110
though then homeland security would
become a major focus for Putin.

262
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,280
Unfortunately,

263
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,370
this is something that became really
clear during the horrific tragedy of the

264
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,240
Beslan school.

265
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,280
In 2014 in September,

266
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:34,810
terrorists held over 1000 people hostage
at the Beslan school in North Asitia.

267
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,460
Nearly 800 of these hostages.

268
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,900
They were children for three days.

269
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,570
These terrorists demolishing Chechen,

270
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:43,930
an independence from Russia helped these
people hostage situation had a tragic

271
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:44,830
ending when tanks,

272
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,251
rockets,

273
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:48,670
and other artillery we used by the Russian
military to try to clear the school.

274
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,300
Special Forces entered the school after
hearing explosions from inside were the

275
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:53,500
hostages were being caps,

276
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,700
but their actions,

277
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,080
they did not save lives.

278
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,330
Quite the contrary in the
siege of the school ever.

279
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,590
300 people died,

280
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,710
nearly two thirds of whom
were children the tragedy.

281
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,640
It shook the world,

282
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,890
and while the government's
was cleared of any wrongdoing,

283
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:06,580
initially,

284
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,060
the European Court of human rights later
stated that Russia had used excessive

285
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,650
force and lacked caution,

286
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,530
and they storm into the school just
bawling his anger and discontentment that

287
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,540
the government's handling
of the tragedy in general,

288
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,500
it did not affect the public's view
of pewter and very much at all,

289
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,291
quite the opposite.

290
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:20,740
In fact,

291
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,160
a poll taken off to the
best of a masochist stated
that 83 percent of Russians

292
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,120
were still happy with him.

293
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,090
The vessel and tragedy did lead to
changes in the halls of Russian power,

294
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:31,180
though primarily giving more
power to the Russian president.

295
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:31,781
For instance,

296
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,260
instead of electing governors in
regions like north Asitia in Chechnya,

297
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,150
the presidents would have the power
to appoint governance in 2007,

298
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,150
and during his second term,

299
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,000
Putin was named Time
Magazine's person of the year.

300
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,530
The magazine called the final year of
his second term is most successful yet,

301
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,180
and it's the cover photo for the issue,

302
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,410
a portrait of Putin,

303
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,510
one the photographer,

304
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,230
the world press photo award.

305
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,120
During the shoot that
you've discussed them,

306
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,030
mutual admiration for the Beatles.

307
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,190
This connection helped you tend to
become more comfortable and it's for the

308
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,760
photographer,

309
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,600
the chance to get an award winning
shot of the intimidating world leader.

310
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,430
No matter how popular Putin was,

311
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:09,910
though that Russian people could not
elect him to a third time the Russian

312
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:11,470
constitution simply for credit.

313
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,040
However,

314
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,820
pieces and found a way around this role
just when his time in office was about

315
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:15,920
to years

316
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,753
run out.

317
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,610
Presidential terms in Russia
had been extended to six years,

318
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:31,470
but this change did not benefit Putin.

319
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,650
He was beholding to the
previous constitutional rules.

320
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
So how is it you got to stay in
power while the man who was elected,

321
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:40,530
Russia's next presidents
was Dimitri Medvedev,

322
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,580
and he was a protege of Putin's and
benefited from Putin's rise to power.

323
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,720
Neither he nor I wanted Putin's it'd be
pushed off the international stage and

324
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,890
so medvedev unnamed Putin
as Russia's prime minister,

325
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,120
a position he had previously held
under Boris Yeltsin after 13 years in

326
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,420
leadership at present would remain
as the highest levels of Russia's

327
00:14:59,421 --> 00:14:59,990
governments.

328
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,740
He and his supporters were able to keep
them in power and stay in line with the

329
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:04,230
law,

330
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,400
although not exactly in
line with its exact intent.

331
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,030
During his third time as prime
minister from 2008 to 2012,

332
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,830
Putin focused on dealing with the economic
crisis that swept the wells as well

333
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,510
as Russia's population problems.

334
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,060
Russia is population was falling
by 1 million people a year,

335
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:25,220
a devastating number for a country
whose population is only $150 million in

336
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:26,000
2010.

337
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,150
The trend is reversed and
Russia's population began to grow.

338
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,900
The reversal is empowered credited
to Putin's economic reforms.

339
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,400
When people have more money,

340
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,920
it is easier to support a larger family.

341
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,060
One of Putin's economic reforms include
in joining the World Trade Organization

342
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:45,050
or WTO in 2012 negotiations
for rushing to join.

343
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:48,260
The WTO lasted nearly two
decades as they had started.

344
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,730
After the fall of the Soviet Union,

345
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,800
Russia was granted entry into the WTO.

346
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,790
Often negotiations reached a point in
which granted Russia permission to phase

347
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,200
in the opening of markets.

348
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,990
Wireless aligns with other
WTO trading requirements.

349
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,880
Now all his political party
retains dominance and Putin
was again the candidate

350
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,410
for president in 2012.

351
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,310
He did not escape politically unscathed
from his maneuver to hold onto power

352
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:15,620
buying.

353
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,230
Sidestepping the term limits the elections
in 2012 for that heavily protested

354
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,830
with claims of fraud tainting
Putin's election to a third time.

355
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,241
The task,

356
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,680
if the government is not only
to pour honey into a cup,

357
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,170
but sometimes do you give it
a medicine bottle display?

358
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,911
Those protests?

359
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,121
Well,

360
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,460
he was inaugurated in May of 2012,

361
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,370
and this time his term would be six years.

362
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,900
This means that Putin will be president
of Russia until at least 2018 and with

363
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:44,830
allegations of his interference in the
United States elections is prominence in

364
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:45,400
the world.

365
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,820
My only turn you seems to road

366
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,400
wheaton has continued to be reelected,

367
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,840
reappointed to positions at the highest
level of Russian government's his time

368
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:00,411
in office.

369
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:04,040
It's not been without questions
surrounding his shady actions.

370
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,800
Among the high points or
low points we should say,

371
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,250
of intrigue surrounding Poussin.

372
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,970
All the murders of Russian journalists,

373
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,460
that's of generalists were any
points of concern in Russia.

374
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,050
Longed for Putin's rise to power,

375
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,140
but the issue well,

376
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:20,330
it began to get a lot of international
attention during Putin's second time as

377
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,680
presidents when journalists,

378
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,870
a political sky was murdered.

379
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,440
This journalist had been a strong critic
of Putin and particularly the war in

380
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,040
Chechnya.

381
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,000
Even before her death,

382
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:32,100
she was even poisoned but
ultimately recovered her mother.

383
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,740
It remains to this day on solved,

384
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,110
but there is suspicion that
Putin and his governance,

385
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,990
well maybe they targeted taught well.

386
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,270
Let's.

387
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,660
Sky is also far from the
only Putin opponents.

388
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,900
His death has occurred in suspicious
circumstances in March of 2017.

389
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:49,901
The Washington Post even published a
list of 10 such deaths among deaths was a

390
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:54,210
former deputy prime minister and Putin
critic who was shot outside the Kremlin.

391
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,940
He was a tycoon and his death
was initially called a suicide,

392
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,900
but now that's rather unsure is also a
generalist who was kidnapped and shot in

393
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,030
the woods and the former KGB agent.

394
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,220
He was found to be
poisoned by Russian agents.

395
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,940
Then there's the generalist who died of
a mysterious illness and he's medical

396
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,770
records have been sealed.

397
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,340
Sajan not failing on any intriguing.

398
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,183
Yeah,

399
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,900
I get many of these deaths may never be
proven beyond doubt to be the work of

400
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:24,840
Putin's government.

401
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,010
One thing is absolutely certain Vladimir
Putin does not like to be viewed as

402
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:31,010
weak.

403
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,910
He has done all he can to prevent strength
and show the world that he is strong

404
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:35,800
and manly.

405
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,090
Beyond is active
participation in martial arts.

406
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:40,190
He shows his power and
dominance by hunting,

407
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:40,671
tracking,

408
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:42,470
and closing with wild animals.

409
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,060
He's caught a huge fish including a
46 pounds pike and shot a crossbow.

410
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:47,930
At a whale,

411
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,400
normally to tranquilize it though,

412
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,060
you also want to save to camera crew
from a Siberian tiger that was about to

413
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:55,880
attack them while on a tour
of a wildlife sanctuary.

414
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,420
Further,

415
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,320
he's actually got close
enough to hold a bas.

416
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,730
Do you attach a tracking device
to them for a research project?

417
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,150
Now,

418
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,650
polar bears might look cute in your mind.

419
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,180
I think this is particularly dangerous,

420
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:07,540
but they're actually
incredibly vicious creatures.

421
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,830
Susan is also attached
himself to an experiment,

422
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:12,920
so flying machine to accompany
birds on my graduation,

423
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,920
and it's important to note that he
always does these things carefully,

424
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,650
making sure that that
photographer is presence.

425
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,880
The more I know about people,

426
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,320
the more I like dogs.

427
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,760
I like simple animals.

428
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,051
What?

429
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:25,670
He's not hanging out with wild
animals who didn't make time for other

430
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:27,650
adventurous and athletic activities.

431
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,290
He dives into black seed
and explores shipwrecks,

432
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:30,961
plays hockey.

433
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,750
You ride snowmobiles and motorcycles,

434
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,950
and does even driven a Formula One
racecar once during a visit to a Russian

435
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:37,490
youth camp.

436
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,150
Even challenged attendees to arm wrestle
with him then nor contends with arm

437
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:42,500
wrestling as a show of strength.

438
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,470
He trying to bend a frying
pan with his bare hands.

439
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,180
Naturally though
photography his own hands,

440
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,880
you capture all of these incredible
moments and the photos have been

441
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,480
distributed,

442
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
widely viewed around the world.

443
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,220
You've probably seen several of them
from his days at school cultivating an

444
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:59,270
athletic reputation to his
time as president and Prime
Minister Putin has made

445
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,970
it known that he isn't
mad to be recognized

446
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,150
during this most recent time as
president with a couple of years left go,

447
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,850
Putin has found himself
centered on the world stage.

448
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,490
Russia has been involved
in the Syrian civil war,

449
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,300
supporting the governments of Bashar al.

450
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,810
Al sat in early july of 2017,

451
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:26,330
vladimir putin and Donald Trump announced
a ceasefire in southwestern Syria and

452
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,180
weeks later Russia announced that it
had signed a deal with Syria allowing

453
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:34,350
Russia to keep it sad base in the country
for at least 50 more years in addition

454
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:34,860
to Syria.

455
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,820
PerhAps putin's most talked
about involvement haS been
the alleged interference

456
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,140
of Russia in the u.

457
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,680
S election from hacking allegations do
you questions of elicit meetings and

458
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,690
deals with members of
trump's inner circle.

459
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,530
The u s ends the wells media.

460
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,810
I've made putin and
his political dealings,

461
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,790
a household conversation topic,

462
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,150
so let them be opposing.

463
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,500
It began his life growing up in a
communal apartments in the midst of Russia

464
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,490
during the cold war,

465
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,640
and that's become an
internationally polarizing figure.

466
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,080
He's been strong and unapologetic in
his foreign policy and use of force and

467

questions while they're around his
treatments of political opponents and

00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:09,520
critical Journalists.

469
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,270
Putin,

470
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,500
he's unwilling to sit back,

471
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,810
be a shrinking violet on the world stage,

472
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,770
ensuring Russia remains a world
power with a great deal of influence.

473
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,900
He has done overtly,

474
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,260
can't cultivate an image of strength
both for Russia as a country and for

475
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,370
himself personally,

476
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,290
showing no signs of stopping

enters his sixties.

478

Vladimir putin,

479
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:35,350
he has undoubtedly made a
place for himself in world
history and within eligible

480
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:37,330
for reelection in 2018.

481
