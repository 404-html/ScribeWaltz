1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,630
It is better to be feared than
loved if you cannot be both.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,370
So you might agree with this statement.

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,510
If you fancy yourself.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,280
A Macchia,

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,220
Vallian Italian diplomat and Niccolo
Machiavelli lived over funny of centuries

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,221
ago,

7
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:15,690
but its influence among unscrupulous
politicians reaches into the modern age.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,390
He is mostly known for writing
a book called the Prince.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,280
The handbook established him as the
father of modern political theory through

10
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:24,120
its teachings.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,500
Power is the ultimate goal
through any means necessary.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,470
Back who was born in Florence on May
the third 1469 to Bernardo did Niccolo

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,610
Machiavelli a lawyer and his wife bought
all the mayor to Stefan and Nelly.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,870
He was the oldest son of his parents
with two elder sisters and a younger

15
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:58,500
brother.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,610
The backing of Elliot family,

17
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:01,740
it was an established middle class family,

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,450
not particularly affluent,

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,280
but they have means Machiavelli was born
during a tumultuous time in history in

20
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,070
which the pope's waged war
against the Italian city.

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,750
States and political alliances frequently
changed eating to the swift rise and

22
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,580
fall of many short lived governments,

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,090
France,

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,451
Spain,

25
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:19,650
and the holy Roman Empire.

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,100
All battled for regional
control and influence.

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,480
He began his elementary education at
the age of seven and studied grammar

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,890
rhetoric as well as Latin.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,830
Not much is known about Macchia
of how these young life,

30
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:36,150
aside from the fact that he was well
versed in the ancient classics among these

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,650
he highly prized as copy of levees
history of the Roman republic.

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,760
Machiavelli's first recorded involvement
in the volatile Florentine political

33
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:59,110
scene occurred in 1498 when he helps
the political faction that depose gear

34
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,571
alarm,

35
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:00,580
oh Savonarola,

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,820
who was the then dominance,

37
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,640
religious and political
figure in Florence.

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,391
In the same year,

39
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,110
Macchia valley was appointed to the
second chancery of the Republic as

40
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:11,170
Chancellor and secretary to
the 10 of liberty and peace,

41
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,010
a sensitive government agency dealing
chiefly with warfare and foreign affairs.

42
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,600
Machiavelli participating in both domestic
politics and in diplomatic missions

43
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,770
to foreign governments.

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,280
These posts allowed him many
opportunities over the next 14 years,

45
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:27,310
which allowed him to closely examine
the inner workings of government,

46
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,680
the awesome as many prominent
individuals among them.

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,820
Cesari Borgia who furnished the young
diplomats with the major profile of

48
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,730
leadership for the Prince Lakia value.

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,270
Quickly gains political prominence
and influence by 15 oh [inaudible].

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,800
He was a well respected
assistant to be Republican.

51
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,550
Head of state,

52
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,550
Piero Soderini in 1512 Spanish forces
invaded Italy and the Florentine political

53
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,770
climates changed abruptly.

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,740
The Medici family where the
rulers of Florence for centuries,

55
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,170
but in 1494 and they were exiled,

56
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,780
allowing for an autocratic
regime to seize,

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,160
not here valley.

58
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,630
It was purged from office jails and then
tortured for is well known Republican

59
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,410
sentiments.

60
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,060
It was also finally banished to his
country of residence in pack Kasina.

61
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,240
You've already spent this time offering
these small body of political writings

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
that sealed his place in history completed
between 1513 and 1517 discourses upon

63
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:24,220
the first decade of t Livia and the
prints were not published until after

64
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:27,700
Machiavelli's death in
1531 and 1532 respectively.

65
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,480
Around 1518 he turned
from pros to drama in La.

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,070
Mandra Gola likely offers other writings.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,600
It is firmly predicated on an astute
and unsentimental awareness that human

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,840
nature is flawed and given
to self centeredness.

69
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,620
The play was popular with
audiences throughout much
of Italy for several years.

70
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,660
Isn't that Steph say,

71
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,090
military treatise published in
1521 and didn't title the Libero.

72
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,470
Della Rta dela Guerra.

73
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,000
The Art of war was the only historical
or political work published during the

74
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,870
author's lifetime.

75
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,471
Meanwhile,

76
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,100
Macchia valley had made several
attempts to gain favor with the Medici,

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,510
including dedicating the Prince de
Lorenzo in 1520 he was appointed official

78
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,200
historian of Florence and was subsequently
and trusted with minor governmental

79
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:08,860
duties.

80
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,820
His prodigious history of Florence
carefully dilutes his Republican platform

81
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,980
with the DC and bias expected of him.

82
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,020
In 1525 pope Clement the seventh
recognize his achievements with a monetary

83
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,550
stipends two years later,

84
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,870
the Medici where again,

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,650
ousted and Macchia valley's hopes for
advancement under the revived republic.

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,580
We're frustrated this was because the
new governments were suspicious of his

87
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,210
ties to the Medici Dessau,

88
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,300
Austin's by his country's internal strife,

89
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:38,080
Macchia value fell gravely ill
and died a disillusions man.

90
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
His dream of an operational republic.

91
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,880
Unrealized critics have found it
ironic that the fist and the Republican

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
Machiavelli should have written a
handbook advising an autocratic leader how

93
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,520
best to acquire and
maintain power and security.

94
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,210
Machiavelli was acutely aware,

95
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,730
however,

96
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,060
foreign threats to Italian autonomy and
is thus deemed necessary for a strong

97
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,481
prince.

98
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,180
Two fought French and
Spanish hedger money.

99
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,060
Hence the Prince was addressed
to the ruling MEDICI.

100
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,950
He believes there's a shrewd head of state
exemplified by Boria was essential to

101
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:11,350
sublimated self interest to Commonwealth,

102
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:15,160
that since handbooks of conduct music
monarchal needs had become immensely

103
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,840
popular by the 14 hundreds the external
form of the prince was neither startling

104
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,750
nor particularly remarkable to
Machiavelli's contemporaries.

105
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,580
Yet from its initial appearance,

106
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,100
the prince proved no
mere manual of protocol,

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,540
nor for even that matter of even
conventional strategy in its chapters,

108
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:35,530
Machiavelli delineated a typology of
sovereignties and the deployment of

109
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,520
available forces,

110
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,941
military,

111
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,440
political or psychological,

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,510
to acquire and retain them.

113
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,610
The prince is the first political treaters
to divorce statecraft from ethics as

114
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,510
Machiavelli wrote,

115
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,080
how one lives is so far removed
from how one ought to live,

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,830
that he who abandons what one
does for what one ought to do,

117
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,610
learns rather his own ruin than is
preservation adding to his unflinching

118
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,170
realism.

119
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,570
The common renaissance belief in humanity
has capacity for determining its same

120
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,370
destiny.

121
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,050
Machiavelli evaluate,

122
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,420
posited to fundamentals and necessary
for effective political leadership,

123
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,950
Vertigo and for tuna virtually
refers to the princess own abilities,

124
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,910
ideally a combination of force and
cunning four to now to the unpredictable

125
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:20,750
influence of fortune and a significant
departure from previous political

126
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,320
thought.

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,970
The designs of providence play no part
in Machiavelli's skim on issues of

128
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,481
leadership.

129
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,570
Heather t masked by other
political theorists in vague,

130
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:30,620
diplomatic terms.

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Machiavelli presented his thesis in
direct Kansas and often passionate speech.

132
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,010
He employed easily grasped metaphors
and structured the whole thing and an

133
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,120
aphoristic vein,

134
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,670
which lends it a compelling authority.

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,450
Reactions to the prince miss initially,

136
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:57,190
but only briefly favorable.

137
00:06:57,191 --> 00:07:01,750
We've Catherine de Medici said to have
enthusiastic included this among other of

138
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:05,230
Machiavelli's writings in the
educational curriculum of our children,

139
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,490
but within a short time,

140
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,200
the book fell in z widespread disfavor
becoming viewed as a handbook for

141
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,370
atheistic tyranny.

142
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
The Prince Sends Akea Valleys,

143
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:17,830
other writings as well what placed in
the people index if prohibited books.

144
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,830
And 1559 the prince was
also held responsible for
fringe political corruption

145
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:27,370
and for widespread contribution to any
number of political and moral vices.

146
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,180
Genzler lays interpretation of the
prince as advocating stage craft by

147
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,890
ruthlessness and amoral.

148
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:37,310
Duplicity was disseminated throughout
Britain through the works of such popular

149
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:37,541
rens,

150
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:42,040
highly influential dramatists as William
Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe in

151
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,420
the prologue to Marlowe's the Jew of
Malta from 50 99 Machiavelli addresses the

152
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:50,800
audience so length at one
point encapsulating the
Elizabethan perception of

153
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,470
Machiavelli by saying I count religion.

154
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,420
There's a childish toy and holds.

155
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,220
There is no sin but ignorance here and
in the works of malaise contemporaries,

156
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,370
Machiavelli was depicted as an agents of
all the Protestant England despised in

157
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:07,510
Catholic high renaissance Italy.

158
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,740
Hostile English interpreters so
effectively typified Macchia valley as an

159
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,270
amalgam of various evils.

160
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,050
The term Machiavellian
is still used today,

161
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,060
rally until the 19th century.

162
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:23,290
Did mention of the prince solicit
anything other than unfounded as largely

163
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,770
unexamined repugnance as Freddy Cheer.

164
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,210
Pally has absolutely summarized centuries,

165
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:32,380
have to elapse before the distinction
between moral moments and political

166
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:36,160
moments between technical approach
and moralistic generalities.

167
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,530
Even between the subject matter of
the book and the authors person,

168
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,380
we're finally achieved modern critics
noting these crucial distinctions,

169
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:48,970
having engaged in a prolonged and animated
discussion concerning Macchia values.

170
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:53,620
True intent in the prince and anomalous
17th century commentator philosopher

171
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:58,120
Pierre Bayle found it strange that there
are so many people who believe that

172
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,410
Machiavel teaches prince's
dangerous politics.

173
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,530
For on the contrary,

174
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:06,900
it princess of taught Mackey ravel
what he has risen since bales time.

175
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:11,460
Further analysis is prompted to the most
prolonged animated discussion relating

176
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,210
to the work.

177
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,380
The true intents of its creator
was the treatise as bail suggested,

178
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,750
a faithful representation
of principally contact,

179
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,630
which might justify or
the incriminated subjects,

180
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,100
but not it's chronic Heller or had Macchia
valley in his manner of presentation,

181
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,130
devise the volume as a vehicle
for his own commentary.

182
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,020
Still more calculatedly at the author
superseded description in ably providing a

183
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,380
legacy for dead spots.

184
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,300
A single conclusion concerning the
author's motive has not been drawn.

185
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,140
The patterns of conjecture of certainly
appeared within Macchia valleys.

186
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,700
Critical heritage Lord
Macaulay and emphasizing the
writers Republican Zealand,

187
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,340
those privation see
suffered in its behalf,

188
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,120
has contended that it is inconceivable
that the motto of freedom should have

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,290
designed diddly acted as
the apostle of tyranny.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,610
The peculiar immorality which is rendered
the prince and popular belonged rather

191
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,470
to the age than to the man.

192
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,400
Others have echoed this suggestion
examining the work and its historical

193
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,210
context.

194
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,980
John Addington Simons has deemed it
simply a handbook of prince crafts.

195
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,720
As that art was commonly received,

196
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:16,290
Nestle,

197
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,250
where the principles of public morality
had been translated into terms of

198
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,840
material aggrandizement,

199
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,980
glory gain,

200
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,083
and greatness.

201
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,890
Many of Machiavelli intended the treatise
as a veiled satiric attack on the

202
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,370
methods of Italian tyranny
or by a truce methods.

203
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,010
It's confess according to Harold j Lasky,

204
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,170
the prince is a textbook
for the house of Muddy.

205
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:41,220
See sit hounds in the tons that I mean
history would make them appreciate it and

206
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:45,570
set out that it's author might hope for
their realization of his insights into

207
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:49,290
the business of government
while ultimately unable
to agree on the underlying

208
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,130
purpose of the prince.

209
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:54,120
Nearly all critics have nonetheless
been persuaded of it's masterful

210
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:54,930
composition,

211
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,630
even when unwilling to
endorse its principles.

212
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,150
Mccauley has a firms
that's the judicious ends.

213
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:04,520
Ken's in minds of Macchia valley shows
itself in his luminous manly and it's

214
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:08,700
polished language and Francesco to sanctus
has determined to this where he was

215
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,990
quite unconscious a form.

216
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,320
He was a master a form without
looking for Italian prose.

217
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,373
You found it.

218
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,390
The sheer volume and intensity studies
of the prince of far exceeded those

219
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,790
directed a Mackie of how these discourses.

220
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,271
However,

221
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:24,330
the last work has been acknowledged
as an essential companion piece.

222
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,140
Do the format,

223
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,891
all of the authors,

224
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:27,690
subsequent studies treating history,

225
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:32,130
political science and military theory
stem from this dissertation that contains

226
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:34,440
the most original thought
of Macchia valley,

227
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,550
less flamboyant than the prints and narrow
or in its margin for interpretation.

228
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,650
The discourses contains Macchia Valleys,

229
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,420
undisguised admiration for ancient
governmental forms and is most elegant,

230
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,490
thoroughly explicated republicanism.

231
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,560
Commentators have noted the presence of
gravity and Skillful Rick that at times

232
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,890
punctuate prince but are in full
evidence only in that works.

233
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,753
Final chapter,

234
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,930
a memorable exhortation to the
Medicis to resist foreign tyranny.

235
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,730
The discourse is also presents
that methodical extrapolation
of political theory

236
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:08,530
from historical documentation,

237
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,570
which is intimate and in the Prince Max.

238
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:14,740
Alina has observed this if the prince
is great because it gives us the grammar

239
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:18,700
of power for a government for discourse
is a great because they give us the

240
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,670
philosophy of organic unity.

241
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,030
Knots in the governments put in a state
and the conditions under which a loan a

242
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:26,410
culture can survive.

243
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,890
It has been deemed not at all in
Congress that an intellect in Merced in

244
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:33,580
historical circumstance and political
impetus should say naturally embrace

245
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:34,450
comedy as well.

246
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,130
For Machiavelli regarded comedy exactly
as he conceived history and interplay of

247
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,830
forces leading unavoidably
to a given results.

248
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,610
Machiavelli's manager Gola is
only work in the comedic genre,

249
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,530
clearly reflected this parallel.

250
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,730
It's not practice has remarked this under
the frivolous surface of Mandra Gola

251
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,570
are hidden.

252
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,010
The profoundest complexities of the inner
life and to the action is propelled by

253
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,830
spiritual forces as inevitable as fate.

254
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,620
It is enough to know the
characters to guests the ends,

255
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,440
the drama scenario concerns
kind of Maca is desired to bed.

256
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,160
Lucretia,

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,250
the beautiful young wife of a doddering
fool masquerading as a doctor at Maca

258
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,920
advises the husband Nikia to administer
a potion of mandrake to the crees yet to

259
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,060
render her fertile.

260
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,390
He also warns that the drug could have
fatal implications for the first man to

261
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:19,991
have intercourse.

262
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:20,530
With that,

263
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,390
he slightly suggest student Nikia.

264
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,250
There's a dup films for this
purpose persuaded by her
confessor ray navel cleric

265
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,020
to comply with her husband's wishes.

266
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,310
The virtuous new creature or the last
allows Calico into her badge where he has

267
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,360
no difficulty convincing her to accept
him as her lover on a more permanent

268
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,060
basis.

269
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,920
Sales of this sort,

270
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,560
we're already commonplace throughout
Europe and the Middle Ages.

271
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,240
The critics have remarked that Machiavelli
lent freshness to even this hackney

272
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:46,930
material,

273
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,590
Sydney Angler,

274
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,670
who has commended as clear,

275
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,331
crisp a rep,

276
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:49,841
our team,

277
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,770
and his ability to nudge on ribs at
improprieties and double meanings,

278
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,380
just blind to characterization
that is rudimentary,

279
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,100
haphazard,

280
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,730
and inconsistent with even protagonists
going through their motions like

281
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:01,460
automata.

282
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,900
Mccauley,

283
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,411
on the other hand,

284
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,280
is applauded the players correct and
vigorous delineation of human nature.

285
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,210
It decided influence on the philosophies
of Thomas Hobbes and Sir Francis Bacon

286
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,260
and eggs on the thoughts of such
modern political theorists says,

287
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,320
Vilfredo Pareto.

288
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,950
Machiavelli has been [inaudible] the
founder of empirical political science,

289
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,060
primarily on the strength
of the discourses and the
prints taken in historical

290
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,571
perspective.

291
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,660
It is understandable that the prince
should have dwarfed Machiavelli's other

292
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,150
works for with this slim treatise,

293
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,910
the author confronted the ramifications
of power when it's procurement and

294
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,740
exercise,

295
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,150
when notably preemptory commentators
have come to weigh the integrity of

296
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:40,870
Machiavelli's controversial fought
against the pressing political conditions

297
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:41,704
which formed us.

298
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,610
So I'm like Roberto Ridalfi
have endeavored through
their studies to dislodge

299
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,970
the longstanding perception of
Machiavelli valley as a ruthless character

300
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,910
stating in judging Macchia valley
one to take accounts of his anguish,

301
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:53,960
despair of virtue,

302
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,360
and just tragic sense of evil on the basis
of sentences taken out of context and

303
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,720
is of outward appearances.

304
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,390
He was judged a cold and cynical man,

305
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,210
a snare,

306
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,580
a to religion and virtue,

307
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,320
but in fact there is hardly a page of
his writing and certainly no action of

308
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,020
life that does not show
him to be passionate,

309
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,760
generous audits and basically religious
Peter Bonds and other has stated in

310
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,230
European writers Makaveli.

311
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:22,520
It created a new religion out of politics
with all its faithful implications for

312
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,320
modern intellectual history.

313
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,150
In 59 to Machiavelli
married Marietta Corps Sini.

314
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,770
The couple had six children together,

315
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,150
four sons and two daughters.

316
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,380
Niccolo Machiavelli's the prince is one
of the most celebrated and notorious

317
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:47,110
books in the history of
Western political thought,

318
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,120
most celebrated and notorious books in
the history of Western political thought.

319
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,940
It continues to influence
discussions of war and peace,

320
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:59,200
the nature of politics and the relation
of private ethics to public duties.

321
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,420
Ostensibly a 16th century
manual of instruction on
certain aspects of Princeton.

322
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,540
He rule in behavior.

323
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,710
The prints anticipates and complicates
modern political and philosophical

324
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:09,520
questions.

325
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,770
What is the right order of society?

326
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,270
Can Western politics still be the model
for progress toward peace and prosperity

327
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,830
or does our freedom to create
our individual purposes
and pursuits undermine our

328
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:22,060
public responsibilities?

329
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,760
Are the characters of our
politics markedly different?

330
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,600
For better or for worse than
the politics of the era's?

331
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,550
Machiavelli argues that there is no ideal
transcending and daughter to which one

332
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:38,080
can conform and that the right order is
merely the one that has the capacity to

333
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,190
persist over time.

334
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,721
The prince,

335
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:44,440
his emphasis on the importance of an
effective truth over any abstract ideal

336
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,790
Marxist as one of the first works
of modern political philosophy.

337
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,760
