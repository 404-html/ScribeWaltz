00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,280
He was the most influential
thinker in world history,

7
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:26,610
a man whose ideas permeated
every sector of society.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,650
He is the father of modern logic,

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,840
the inventor of the sons of biology,

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,510
and the founder of ethical reasoning.

This body Tonia,

12
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:35,790
small fragments of his writing,

13
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,990
surviving to our times.

14
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:41,991
His influence on both the western and
the Islamic world has been profound in

15
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,130
this week's by graphics.

16
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,460
We discover the brilliance of Aristotle,

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
the details of Aristotle's life,

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,030
a sketchy.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,030
We know that he was born in 384 BC in the
Greek Macedonian town of stuck area on

20
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,920
the north coast of the GMC.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,700
His father,

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,300
Nica Marcus was the quarter
physician to the Macedonian King.

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,650
I'm an interest the seconds it is believed
that Aristotle's mother faced us was

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,600
descended from Greek aristocracy,

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,810
the couple and three children
with aristotle being the youngest.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,130
He had assistant named Aaron Nestor and
a brother named Ron Ness stores and they

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,340
come back has died when
aristotle was only 13.

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,210
His mother died soon after and he was
raised through his teenage years by his

29
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:30,530
older sister's husband,

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,230
proximus by the age of 17 aristotle.

31
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,780
He was sent to Athens to
pursue higher education.

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,000
They are enrolled at Plato's academy.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,620
Plato was the most renowned thinker of
the time who himself had been taught by

34
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:43,790
the great socrates.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,810
The academy had been found 20 years
earlier and was situated beside an olive

36
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:51,710
grove outside of the city walls
rather than a formal school with a set

37
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,400
curriculum and to clear delineation
between teacher and students.

38
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,350
The academy provided an informal setting
whether master plato was pose problems

39
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:02,240
to be pondered by his students.

40
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,040
Instead of listening to lectures,

41
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,510
the students were encouraged to engage
in dialectic discussion in order to

42
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:12,170
establish a truth by means
of reasoned argument.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,820
The main subjects under discussion,

44
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,810
well philosophy,

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,820
mathematics and destroy enemy.

46
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,370
Aristotle studied at the
Academy for 20 years,

47
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:22,610
advancing from students to
teach teacher during this time.

48
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:26,210
He developed a great respect and
a close friendship with Plato,

49
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:26,900
the two men,

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,261
however,

51
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:30,710
they did have some fundamental
philosophical differences.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,461
As a result,

53
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,430
when Plato died in 347 bce,

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,271
aristotle,

55
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:39,500
his most brilliant students was not
offered the directorship of the academy.

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,960
That privilege instead went to
Plato's nephews abusive post.

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,190
Shortly thereafter,

58
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,260
Aristotle left the academy apparently
unhappy with the direction that it was

59
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:48,770
taking.

60
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,060
It is also possible that he was keen
to get out of Athens as a result of the

61
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,520
tide of anti Macedonian
send them and in the city,

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,140
Iris does a little hand by this time,

63
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,490
developed some important friendships
which would pave the way forward for him.

64
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,810
One of them was hmi as king of the
Greek city of tenures in Asia Minor.

65
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,420
How many us was a former
students at Plato's academy.

66
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,040
Upon hearing of the master's death,

67
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,980
he invited aristotle to
come to our tennis irs,

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,420
sessionals and assets.

69
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:24,230
The city which faced the island of lesbos
that he became the head of a group of

70
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:26,630
philosophers establishing
a brand new academy.

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,020
His focus there was only the
observation of the natural world.

72
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,280
He also begins to work on two volumes
dealing with politics and kingship.

73
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,600
During his time in Asshole,

74
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,560
Sandra social met,

75
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,340
fell in love with and married the
niece of Hmi is named five theists,

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,190
soon adult who was born who
was also named five years.

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,540
Soon,

78
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,170
officer us was attacked
by the Persians and gang.

79
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,540
Homies was taken captive and executed.

80
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,000
Iris doesn't lend his family.

81
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:53,540
They relocated to the island of Lesbos
where they spent the next two years.

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,100
It was here that he indulged in his
passion for the study of marine life.

83
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,910
The work the terrorists were conducted
on the islands gave rise to a whole new

84
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:02,960
scientific discipline,

85
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,093
biology,

86
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,090
the study of life.

87
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,120
He was relentlessly systematic
in his classifications.

88
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,000
Creatures they were divided into
laundry grieves according to their

89
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,900
characteristics.

90
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,740
This resulted in the publication of
three books that minute detail of the

91
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,600
characteristics of living things.

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,540
He also studied the ecology of the islands

93
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,510
in 343 BC.

94
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,860
Iris also received an
invitation from Philip.

95
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:34,040
The second is the king of massive
dome to come and tutor his son,

96
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,970
Alexander,

97
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,320
who was 13 at the time.

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,520
I accepted and moved his
family to Macedonia where he
became the director of the

99
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,050
Royal Academy.

100
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,880
King Philip had a reputation as an
uncouth and uneducated barbarian warrior.

101
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,260
He was proud of his son,

102
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,010
was developing the same
strength of resolve and wanted
the prince to balance his

103
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:54,420
strength with knowledge and with wisdom,

104
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,400
and he feared that the instruction that
was being provided by the boys too.

105
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:00,290
It is when you create
another version of himself.

106
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,580
It was these concerns that prompted
the king to call for the great teacher,

107
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,440
Aristotle or the academy.

108
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,500
Aristotle taught Alexander and other
young members of the royal household and a

109
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,370
style reminiscence of
the platonic academy.

110
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,770
He instructed them in morality,

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,461
in logic,

112
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:17,870
as well as the arts and medicine.

113
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,561
In addition,

114
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:22,760
one on one lessons were given to Alexander
the only was impetuous and stub and

115
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:25,220
often challenging and
resisting as teacher.

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,701
However,

117
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,780
aristotle exhibited a great patient,

118
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:30,860
says he shaped and molded
the thinking of the future,

119
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,050
conquer his superior reasoning,

120
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,820
inevitably one over the prince.

121
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,450
One of Aristotle's greatest challenges
was to reign in Alexander's impetuous

122
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,930
nature in one memorable
exchange and also the prince.

123
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,770
What the most valuable virtue
was that a soldier could possess.

124
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,800
Alexandra immediately
replied that it was courage,

125
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,610
but what aristotle last would happen
if the war he has excess courage,

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,840
cost and to run ahead of his army
and face the enemy all alone.

127
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,170
Alexander acknowledge that
he would surely be killed.

128
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,370
What though the teacher
asked what happened,

129
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,220
and if a lack of courage cause the
soldier to run the other direction,

130
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,360
well then he would be a coward.

131
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,961
Came on exam,

132
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,850
just reply by this exchange.

133
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,130
Aristotle taught Alexander the importance
of always finding the middle pines and

134
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,350
therefore developing
balance in one's life.

135
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,910
Aristotle also educated Alexander in
the warrior hero traditions of the past.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,780
He provided the teenager with a copy
of the Iliad and is encouraged in the

137
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:31,640
opponent assuming rulerships conquer the
barbarian lands to the East Aristotle

138
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:31,940
House,

139
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,580
very ethnocentric view of non Greeks,

140
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,980
which he doubtedly passed onto his people.

141
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,740
He viewed them as fits only for slavery.

142
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:44,000
Ends famously gave this piece of advice
to the future and be a leader to the

143
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,510
Greeks,

144
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,650
and they dispatched to the barbarians
to look after the former as friends and

145
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,540
relatives and to deal with the latter.

146
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,970
As with beasts or plants,

147
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,870
Iris Delta was able to cultivate in the
teenage prints a love of reading and of

148
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,430
learning for the rest of his life.

149
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,150
Alexander remains an avid
reader developing a special
love for the writings of

150
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,630
homer.

151
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,830
It is claimed the Eland,

152
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
all 15,693 lines of poetry
in the Eliana by heart.

153
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,440
The princes education at the
ends of the great philosopher.

154
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,350
It came to an abrupt halt in 340 BC.

155
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,160
Alexander was the 16 year old out of
the throne and he was called to Pella to

156
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,490
rule over Macedonia while
his father was off waging war

157
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,880
by 335 BC,

158
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,130
Alexander and succeeded his
father as king one visit.

159
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,810
First acts was to conquer Athens,

160
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:38,410
which paved the way for our results are
returned to the city where he had spent

161
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:39,790
his formative years,

162
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,810
Plato's academy,

163
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:45,070
which was now run by a former student
names and socrates was still the leading

164
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,510
influence on Greek thinking.

165
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:46,961
However,

166
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:51,790
aristotle was given permission
by Alexandra to start up
his own rival academy.

167
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,571
As a foreigner,

168
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,600
aristotle was not able to
own property in Athens.

169
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,261
As a result,

170
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:58,360
he rented a building called the Lyceum,

171
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:01,090
which was a former wrestling
school and outside of the city.

172
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,440
Unlike Plato's academy,

173
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:06,670
the Lyceum was not a private club for
half of the day are still some tutors

174
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:09,550
which teach that Peng
students in advanced topics.

175
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,300
Then the doors would be opened and the
lectures and discussion would be free of

176
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:13,631
charge.

177
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:16,340
It's open to anyone who
wish to attend narrow,

178
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,580
soulful spent the bulk of
the remainder of his life.

179
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,630
Working at the Lyceum,

180
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,710
he develops a unique style teaching his
students while they wandered around the

181
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,850
gardens of the school.

182
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,580
This gave rise to the
nickname peripatetics,

183
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,290
meaning people who wonder about this
guy of study at the lyceum was vast.

184
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,700
Aristotle wanted his students to research
and write about every area of human

185
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,680
thought from mathematics to biology,

186
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,221
philosophy,

187
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:39,881
politics,

188
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:40,714
and the rhetoric.

189
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,350
Students were required to write their
arguments down in manuscript form.

190
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,840
These were collected
in the lyceums library,

191
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:50,530
which became one of the first great
collections of historical writings,

192
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,860
and sometime during the first few
years after his return to Athens,

193
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,450
Aristotle's wife Pythius,

194
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,400
she died.

195
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,620
It is believed that the Persian
king upsets the terrorists.

196
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,110
Delta has helped to arrange
and aligns with Macedonia.

197
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:03,920
Had pythius arrest is then executed.

198
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,983
Aristotle.

199
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,690
He was heartbreaking in his grief.

200
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,270
He read the poem of
his life that survived,

201
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,360
which he titled an Ode
to Virtue in science,

202
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,350
though Aristotle,

203
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,680
he became romantically involved
with a woman named her phyllis.

204
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,930
Some accounts states that,

205
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,100
uh,

206
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,840
phyllis was a slave who had been given
to aristotle by the court of Alexander,

207
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,460
but this cannot be verified.

208
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,020
The two never married,

209
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,640
but I fill this bore aristotle,

210
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,331
many children,

211
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:31,440
the first of whom they named Nick and
MCASS after aristotle's father have

212
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:34,560
phyllis remains with
aristotle until his death.

213
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
During the years that our stuff was
established as lyceum metathesis,

214
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,971
former people,

215
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:43,050
Alexander was very busy conquering
the known world as his power grew,

216
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:43,890
so did his ego,

217
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,370
the veggies that the philosopher has
instilled in him with cost aside as he

218
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:49,340
became increasingly megalomaniacal.

219
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,940
Eventually he proclaimed himself to be
divine and requires that all peoples

220
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:58,890
prostrate themselves before him in
all of his status as a living going on

221
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,270
aristotle's recommendation,

222
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,280
his nephew Callis,

223
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,260
the knees had been appointed as an office,

224
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:06,030
a story of Alexander's Asiatic expedition.

225
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,300
Palestinians was concerned
about the kings out of control,

226
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:14,301
ego and somewhat foolishly let his
concerns be known and well this led to his

227
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,570
execution.

228
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,340
Then in 323 BC,

229
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:21,030
the 32 year old Alexander and he
suddenly died soon thereafter,

230
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,830
the pro Macedonian governments.

231
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,120
It was forcibly removed.

232
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,680
The Athenians web now back in control
into backlash was unleashed against the

233
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,550
Macedonians.

234
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,160
Aristotle is the leading Macedonian
intellect and supporter of Alexander was a

235
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:44,570
prime target of the new regime and he
was formally charged with impiety or not

236
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,490
believing in the gods of the state.

237
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,510
This was the same charge that had been
leveled at socrates and it led to his

238
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:52,130
conviction and his execution,

239
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,120
stating that he refused to allow
Athens do sin against philosophy twice.

240
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,540
Aristotle decided not to
stay and defend himself.

241
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,960
He fled the city and headed for the
islands of your beer where his mother's

242
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,040
estate was located.

243
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,730
He died on the islands in 323 BC.

244
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:07,760
You have natural causes.

245
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,710
It was 62 years of age.

246
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,071
Now,

247
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:13,100
normally this is where a
graphics video would end,

248
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,830
but there is much more
about aristotle to come,

249
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,050
but first I do want to
thank today's sponsor,

250
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,880
brilliant and I know ads
in the middle of the video.

251
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:23,630
They aren't great that sponsors like
brilliant do make these longer videos,

252
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,960
possible brilliance or assigns learning
platform that allow you to learn through

253
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,890
active learning,

254
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:31,430
which summed up is basically the opposite
of that feeling of reading a complex

255
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:35,900
paragraph about some principle and then
just having absolutely no clue about

256
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,100
what they were going on about,

257
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,340
you know,

258
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,690
even though you read it 10 times,

259
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:41,270
still got no idea what's
happening and brilliant.

260
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,300
Don't just cover the basics or
they totally covered those as well.

261
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:48,380
They go all the way through to really
complex things like advanced statistics,

262
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,891
brilliant,

263
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,170
makes even complex statistical concepts,

264
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:52,340
very easy to understand,

265
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,370
but they're giving you
something super short to read.

266
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:54,911
It's easy,

267
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:58,900
and then you've immediately apply what
you just read to a problem and rinse and

268
00:11:58,901 --> 00:11:59,950
repeat and boom.

269
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,070
Suddenly you understand stuff that you
didn't really think it ever be able to

270
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:03,640
understand.

271
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,380
I've used brilliant to do just this.

272
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:09,970
It's pretty amazing how quickly
you grasped such complex subjects.

273
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,400
You can spoil biographics
by going to brilliant.org,

274
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,020
forward slash buyer graphics,

275
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,360
and now let's get back to aristotle.

276
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,820
Yeah,

277
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,390
Aristotle had died as an enemy of
the state and so memory of him,

278
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,410
it was discouraged.

279
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:26,950
However,

280
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,950
his students and friend
Theophrastus kept says,

281
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,520
writing secretly hidden while also
taking the reins of the lyceum.

282
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,940
The works of Aristotle did not see the
light of day until the beginning of the

283
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:41,440
first century BC when they became
appreciated throughout the Roman world.

284
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,520
After the fall of Rome,

285
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,340
aristotle became familiar to
the Islamic world as well,

286
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:46,690
where many thinkers,

287
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,190
if the time came to appreciate,

288
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,620
is logical deductive methodology.

289
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,161
In fact,

290
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:54,130
it was largely because of his
popularity and the Byzantium worlds that

291
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,980
aristotle's teachings were
able to survive the dark ages.

292
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,750
It was during the 13th century.

293
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,471
See this,

294
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,840
aristotle was reintroduced to the west.

295
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,660
This was achieved primarily
through the work of Thomas Aquinas,

296
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,170
who attempted to amalgamate religious
beliefs with science and philosophy.

297
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,120
Aquinas incorporated Aristotle's assertion
that a wrath lies at the center of

298
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:16,390
the universe as a fundamental
tenets of Catholicism.

299
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,820
During the renascence
and reformation years,

300
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:22,420
a succession of religious reformers
and scientists began to question some

301
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,051
aristotle,

302
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:26,170
he and beliefs that had been
absorbed into the Catholic church.

303
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,030
One of them was the Italian astronomer,

304
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:28,540
Galileo,

305
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,021
Galileo,

306
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:32,770
who presented observational proof
that the earth orbiting the sun.

307
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,670
It's ironic that while aristotle was
undoubtedly have embraced this new

308
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,280
observation the Catholic
church fathers made,

309
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,880
Galileo appeared before the
inquisition and recant a session.

310
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,690
English physicist William Harvey later
discovered that internal organs don't

311
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,000
work the way that aristotle had status.

312
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,650
Another of Aristotle's views that was
disproved was that decay only happens on

313
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:55,930
the Earth while the heavens never change.

314
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,530
Nineteenth Century astronomists Lord
Calvin challenged this notion with the

315
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,610
concept of entropy,

316
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,120
which states that all matter,

317
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,940
whether earthly or heavenly,

318
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,260
will eventually decay.

319
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,610
Aristotle also told the planets and
stars are all encased in crystalline

320
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,331
spheres.

321
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:15,331
Each one nested inside the next with the
earth being the intimate sphere by the

322
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,300
18th century.

323
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:20,740
The contradictory idea that the planets
hang on a void was gaining acceptance.

324
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,080
Aristotle wrote some 10 million words
in order to preserve his thoughts.

325
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,861
Unfortunately,

326
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:34,950
the majority of them have not
survived the passing of the years.

327
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,210
The manuscripts were been covered in the
first century BC when they were edited

328
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,040
by a man named Andronicus.

329
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,150
The works that we have today are derived
from Andronico's as edited versions,

330
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,090
and so we're not directly prepared
for publication by Aristotle.

331
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,600
Today,

332
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,390
we are able to read about a million of
Aristotle's which represents some 20

333
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:57,740
percent of his total work as a result
of the paucity of writings that we have,

334
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,340
we are only able to see a shadow
of the brilliance of aristotle.

335
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,500
The quality of the pros,

336
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,410
which has been lost to us,

337
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,020
was hinted dance by
Roman statesmen Cicero.

338
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,170
He went declaring aristotle's
ratings to those of Plato declared.

339
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,940
If Plato pros with silver,

340
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,450
aristotle's was a flowing river of gold.

341
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,080
The works of Aristotle that have survived
are grouped into four categories.

342
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,030
First is the organization in which
quantify a set of logical principles to

343
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:28,031
follow when conducting an investigation
then comes the theoretical consisting of

344
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,590
a range of treatises on the natural world.

345
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,540
The practical mechanic refocuses,

346
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,910
focuses on achieving excellence
within the individual,

347
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,661
the family,

348
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,680
and in society.

349
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,131
Finally,

350
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,950
the rhetoric writing collect together,

351
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:40,501
aristotle,

352
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:43,130
surviving political and
philosophical speeches.

353
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,650
Aristotle divided the sciences
into three categories.

354
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,640
The productive,

355
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,720
the practical and the
theoretical productive sciences
encompasses such things as

356
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,860
building an architecture,

357
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,770
but also battlefield strategy
in courtroom tactics.

358
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,100
There's also practical sciences which
cover ethics and guided behavior.

359
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,330
The theoretical sciences,

360
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,570
which included mathematics and physics
and full of the quest for knowledge and

361
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,720
understanding is that own end results,

362
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,060
the scope of Aristotle's
scientific research.

363
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,140
It was staggering.

364
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,680
His writings feature minute
descriptions of more than 500 species,

365
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,630
some of the features that he observed.

366
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,970
We're not verified until the
invention of the microscope.

367
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,290
Thousands of years later,

368
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,650
his detailed observations
included the Anatomy Dot,

369
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:30,110
habitat and reproductive
system of the fish,

370
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:30,591
insects,

371
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,210
and animals that he observed.

372
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,650
While on the island of Lesbos.

373
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,450
A trademark of Aristotle's thinking was
that evidence was the ultimate arbiter

374
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,200
of truth.

375
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,240
Regardless of what theories you may hold.

376
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,860
If observation proved them wrong,

377
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,400
then yeah,

378
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,570
must have the humility to discard
them and go with the evidence.

379
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,220
Despite being challenged
with impiety aristotle,

380
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,470
he did believe in God.

381
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,100
However,

382
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,050
his God did not create or control
the universe but could affect it.

383
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,870
He viewed God as the
ultimate abstract reason.

384
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,970
I considered that the highest level of
attainment for a human is to as closely

385
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,270
emulate God's ability to reason abstractly
as possible so the person could get

386
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:14,990
to this heightened ability to reason
the closer they would be to God himself.

387
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,640
Aristotle's greatest contribution to
mankind was that he provided a methodology

388
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:23,930
by which to find solutions to problems
rather than providing the solutions

389
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:24,680
themselves.

390
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,970
When he did come to conclusions,

391
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:29,750
he was careful to qualify it by stating
that the conclusion was based upon the

392
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,160
evidence available at the time.

393
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,000
If new evidence was to come to live
so that proved his conclusions wrong,

394
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,680
then he would discount them.

395
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,370
However,

396
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,370
during the period known as the Christian
Middle Ages between 476 and 1,453 ce,

397
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,410
Aristotle's methodology was cast aside
and the focus went squarely on his

398
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,250
conclusions,

399
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,820
which contrary to his wishes
were accepted without question.

400
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,250
So rather than observing
nature to find the answers,

401
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:00,270
they simply accepted what aristotle
had written on the subject.

402
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,980
Plato and Aristotle ended up with very
different philosophical approaches.

403
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,890
Plato was the ultimate idealist,

404
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,620
but leaving the world around us
is merely a collection of ideas.

405
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,371
On the other hand,

406
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:19,990
aristotle was a realist to believe that
the only reality was the physical world

407
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,010
which we inhabit.

408
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,680
Each man would provide a
work of political philosophy.

409
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,581
In Plato's case,

410
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:25,900
it was entitled the Republic,

411
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:27,040
while Aristotle called.

412
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:27,970
Here's the politic.

413
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,180
Plato's work was focused on
achieving the ideal state.

414
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:35,680
He believed that one way to achieve this
was through the eradication of private

415
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,340
property,

416
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,170
the family and gender roles.

417
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,210
By doing away with these
societal norms play,

418
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:44,470
Jay was hoping to transcend
human selfishness in order
to achieve social unity.

419
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,431
Aristotle,

420
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:46,660
however rejects it,

421
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,940
the end goal of Plato's ideal state,

422
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:52,120
he contended that selfishness
is a part of human nature.

423
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,210
His idea was to design a government that
acknowledged human selfishness and it's

424
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,600
putting in place checks and
balances to mitigate it.

425
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,160
He pointed out the impracticality of
Plato's views asking such questions as who

426
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,710
would look after the children if
they weren't part of a family.

427
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,460
If other contended that human selfishness
is one of the driving forces that

428
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,750
results in achievement.

429
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,480
Aristotle devised a working government
he referred to as policy and it was

430
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,940
balanced between the rich and the poor
with neither one dominating the other

431
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:19,240
end.

432
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,050
People were forced to work together
for the overall good of society while

433
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,580
retaining their property rights.

434
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,630
One of the hallmarks of aristotle's method
of arguments was logical developments

435
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,580
where each point builds upon the last.

436
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,080
This was very different to plato who
would jump all over the place with his

437
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:35,740
ideas.

438
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,431
In contrast,

439
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:40,690
aristotle emphasize the need for mental
discipline by which those engaged in

440
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:43,200
debate would stay focused
on the topic at hand plays.

441
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,270
I was mainly concerned with
the accumulation of knowledge.

442
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,050
He believed that ideas were subjective
and could be influenced by personal

443
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:50,590
views.

444
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,880
Aristotle on the other hand was focused
on observation and the examination of

445
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:55,600
what is real.

446
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,040
He was an objective thinker who did not
allow a place for emotion or personal

447
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,851
opinion play,

448
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,320
so was an idea list.

449
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:02,951
He believed,

450
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,581
for example,

451
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:06,040
but knowing good was enough
for a person to do God.

452
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,911
Aristotle,

453
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:07,301
however,

454
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,310
argued that knowing good
was not good enough,

455
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:14,311
a person had to practice being good to
benefit himself as well as society plays.

456
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,080
They also believed that every
concept has an ideal form,

457
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:21,370
whereas aristotle was a view that every
concept and needed to be studied on an

458
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:23,920
individual level in
order to understand it.

459
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,590
Plato was of the view that reasoning and
thought experiments were sufficient to

460
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,241
prove matters.

461
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:33,220
Whereas Aristotle relies upon direct
experience as a results of their differing

462
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:33,760
approaches.

463
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,700
The scientific contributions of aristotle
were much greater than those of us

464
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:38,534
teacher Plato.

465
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,530
The lastest teachings were
predominantly theoretical,

466
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,880
lacking practicality,

467
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,230
whereas aristotle,

468
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,320
he's left us with the scientific method
which grounded in practical observation.

469
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,700

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,150
so hit that subscribe button
and hit that notification bell.

475
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:03,820
If you actually want to find
out when we put our videos,

476
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:07,690
youtube doesn't work how it used to and
if you want to see something else by us,

477
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:11,500
we got some videos from the archive
link to you on the screen and as always,

478
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,910
thank you for watching.
