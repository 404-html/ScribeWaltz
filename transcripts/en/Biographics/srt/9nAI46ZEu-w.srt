1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,080
Heads up everybody. There's going to
be Japanese pronunciations in this one.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm not Japanese. I don't always get
it at 100% right. I do try though.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,603
Let's get into it.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,720
On march the 20th 1995 five
members of Japan's Aum,

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,920
Shinrikyo cult boarded to the Tokyo
subway in the middle of rush hour.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,670
That's ATM.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,810
They punctured bags of Seren releasing
a deadly cloud of nerve gas into the

8
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:30,680
crowded trains. Commuters were
blinded, racked with spasms,

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,180
some choke to death on their own blood
trapped underground with no, it's run.

10
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:40,181
Some 6,000 people were aghast at
bright spring day and 13 of them died.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,030
The attack was ordered by omes founder
Yoga Instructor Shakara I Sahara a blinds

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:46,990
mistake.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,480
100 had leveraged his intense personal
charisma into massive wealth creating a

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,780
religious embar worth $1 billion,

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,810
but where most of Angeles use
their money to build churches.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,580
I Sohara used his to build an Ami under
his watch on stockpile of chemical

17
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,740
weapons.
They bred deadly viruses.

18
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:07,340
They infiltrated the Japanese authorities
purchasing attack, helicopters,

19
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:11,750
building weapons of mass destruction and
drawing up plans to destroy the worlds.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,900
They were the single most ambitious
cult that has ever existed and they

21
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:21,350
committed all of their crimes while
hiding in plain sight. In the video today,

22
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:25,880
the remarkable story of the man who
nearly brought about Armageddon,

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,180
one of the overriding features of these
videos is just how many of us subjects

24
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,510
come from humble circumstances.
Shocker Sahara,

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,650
he was born new difference born in the
Kumomoto prefecture or on March the

26
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:48,651
second 1955 he was one of
just nine children that his
poor mother bore pour in.

27
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:51,720
This case does have a double meaning.
Aside from all that childbirth,

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,310
they were totally broke.

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,600
All of their income came from their Dad's
part time work as a traditional weaver,

30
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,530
which was barely enough to support
a one man, let alone a large family,

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,380
but that's a horror at this point.
It's still known by his birth name,

32
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:08,910
Cheese Matsumoto. He adds an
additional disadvantage. He was blinds.

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,970
One Eye's vision was completely
gone while the others was impaired,

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,040
shipped off to a state run school for
the blind's. It's only six years old.

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,240
The young boy seemed destined
by fate for hardship.

36
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,110
Only faith doesn't count it on one
thing as a horror, as charisma,

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,800
ferociously intelligence as a horror
was noted by his teachers for the almost

38
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,030
demagogic sway that he had over other
students. His voice was like a weapon,

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,110
but that was something else that
is teachers noted to, as a horror,

40
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,030
had a violence side hurting others. It
was something of a game. Damn one SAS,

41
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:40,830
a horror had decided you were the enemy.

42
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:43,530
He would do everything in
his power to make you suffer.

43
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,630
Despite these early
warnings, though, shocker,

44
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,740
graduated in 1975 with all the
trappings of a deeply ordinary man,

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,910
he failed the tests to get into law and
medical school and settled for studying

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,360
acupuncture, relocating to Cheba
Prefecture, just south of Tokyo.

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,270
He opened his own practice selling
medicines and that was kind of it,

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,650
at least for a few years.

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,640
And 1978 as a horror married his
sweetheart Tomako to settle down to making

50
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,490
babies.
Even as a horror is conviction.

51
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,900
In 1982 for selling fake cures couldn't
shake how fundamentally boring as life

52
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,620
was. However, things were about
to get very, very interesting.

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,120
In the early 1980s Japan's economy had
become the single biggest on earth.

54
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,260
With this expansion, it came a
tidal wave of soulless consumerism.

55
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,860
The results of this was a generation
of Japanese desperate to locate some

56
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,970
meaning in their lives.

57
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,080
So the beginning around 1980 a whole
load of new religion started cropping up.

58
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,590
So you feed the wealthy nations,
impoverished sols,

59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,150
and one of these was Aegon shoe.
It makes your of Buddhism and Hinduism,

60
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,790
they go on to shoe,

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,830
had been around since 1954 but it's
popularity excluded when the government

62
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:52,150
recognized it as an official religion
in 1981 like thousands of others.

63
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:56,680
Shocker Asara was sucked in by its
teachings becoming a devout member.

64
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,450
But rather than gaining enlightenment,
I Sohara gained something even better.

65
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,010
He got an idea like an American rubber
baron watching the first piece of

66
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:11,011
railroad track being laid
as a Horah divine's the new
religions where the future

67
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,700
ends. Well, he wanted a piece of the
action, so he left. I go on a shoe,

68
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,900
the engineer had a spiritual crisis that
allows them to a Benz and Tomoko and

69
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,860
the children and go to India for
two years to study religious texts.

70
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,890
When he finally returned in 1994 he was
ready in some time without Yass a horror

71
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,220
founded own Shinzen.

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,140
No Chi quickly renamed alm Shinrikyo he
changed his name to shock and awe Sohara

73
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,070
and it's began handing out leaflets on
Tokyo street corners and preaching his

74
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,460
new religion. So there's a blinds,
men NOCONA shouting about gold.

75
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,480
Surely the busy people of Tokyo would
have just laughed at him and walked on.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,540
Right? Well, not exactly
do remember the shock.

77
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,810
Jasa Haro was one of the most
charismatic talkers ever born.

78
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:56,280
A guy who could even give Hitler
a run for his money like it.

79
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,250
He's soon put his go to
given gift to diabolical use.

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,290
So at this point we really
need to ask ourselves what,

81
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,270
what was on Shinrikyo when,
what did they believe? Well,

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,770
it's actually kind of hard to say now.

83
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,520
Officially the religion was a Knicks
of Christianity, End Times theology,

84
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:21,570
Hindu creation myths and Buddhism,
Yoga and Nostradamus, his prophecies.

85
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,100
Well apparently whatever else that's
a harder had lying around beneficially

86
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,820
though.
Um,

87
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,700
had it one tenant making us a
horror king as devise virus,

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,490
a hierarchy and structure was designed
to make him rich while quickly and

89
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:39,570
effectively brainwashing everyone
that the cults got its claws into like

90
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:43,980
Scientology, at forced members to pay
for access to higher spiritual plane,

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,730
often making people sign over their
entire fortunes. Unlike Scientology,

92
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:52,560
it also put it in Steve Ots
through extreme pain designed
to break their will on

93
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,790
rituals. They ranged on a scale
of just plain nuts to holy hell.

94
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,280
What hell is going on?

95
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,810
Followers were made to drink as a
harbor is blood and daddy bath water.

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,870
They underwent ordeals of being
plunged into boiling water.

97
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,160
It's a purifying their souls,

98
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,520
the practice that led to many
burns and even one death.

99
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,140
Some were locked up in isolation. Rooms
for days on end of us were force fed,

100
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,300
hallucinogenic drugs.
Above all this floated.

101
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,370
The specter of us are Horab sometimes
literally follow is believed he could

102
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,910
levitate for hours at a time and that
he was capable of reading their minds.

103
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,530
They revered him as a living go onto
reincarnation of Christ or Buddha and the

104
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,760
Hindu god of destruction.

105
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:36,761
Lord Shiva all rolled into some sort
of Super God given now utterly bizarre.

106
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:37,821
All of this,

107
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,900
as you might expect to hear that home
attracted a few hundred loonies are best,

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,760
but oh boy, would you be wrong. As a
horror, he was a gifted. Advertise them.

109
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,750
He recruited only from the upper middle
classes of Japanese society targeting

110
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,920
the well qualified and rich giving
only the aura of an exclusive club,

111
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,660
albeit one that would a robe.
You blinds as Omega three rich,

112
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,930
it's reaching creased, sucking in
more of the young and alienated.

113
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,440
It helps that 1986 markets at
the start of the bubble economy.

114
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:10,850
When Japan became phenomenally wealthy,
not that own was confined to Japan.

115
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,660
Influential Russians began to
join as the decades dragged home.

116
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,710
Even Germans who were recruited
and send American Brown shape,

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,890
and by the late 1980s own was perhaps
the biggest of Japan's new religions.

118
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,950
As a Haro was surrounded by 10,000 devoted
followers on compounds that sprawled

119
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:30,980
outside of Tokyo and in skyscrapers
rented downtown, I would leave.

120
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,090
He told the public he was a new guru
spreading a peaceful message in private.

121
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,530
He told his confidence that one day
he would be the king of Japan as his

122
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,500
influence grew as a hauler is
bullying ways they were sentenced.

123
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,910
He still owns it, forcing own members to
practice extortion and even kidnapping.

124
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,500
There in relatives, friends, some money.

125
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,800
This is money was laundered through a
network of yoga centers and computer shops

126
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:55,820
that the group established with the
help of the Yakuza and 1999 the Tokyo

127
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:59,810
metropolitan government. It finally
granted the religion legal status,

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
even as a horror,

129
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:04,760
began preaching antisemetic conspiracy
theories and saying Americans must be

130
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,700
kills. Some said that and
infiltrated the government itself,

131
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:12,170
bending the law to it's well as the
sun on Japan's most hedonistic decade.

132
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,030
That's a horror was in
a pretty good place.

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,380
He was rich with the religion worth
a cool one, billion American dollars.

134
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,700
He was also worshiped by
thousands of people about that.

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,680
It wasn't enough for the poor
boy from Kumamoto Prefect jet.

136
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,760
He wanted to rule millions and he
didn't care if he had to kill to make as

137
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,440
squalor dreams come true.

138
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,200
It started with our eyes.

139
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,310
It was 11:00 PM on June the 27th of 1994
Yoshiyuki conoce wife began complaining

140
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:44,650
of vision problems.

141
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,130
The Kona is where a typical Japanese
upper middle class couple of living in the

142
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:50,410
leafy kg height suburb of Madison,

143
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:54,730
Modo surrounded by doctors and lawyers
and judges that they fall night though

144
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:57,810
the security of their expensive
neighborhood. It didn't save them,

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,450
barely had Yoshiyuki guns
and check on his wife.

146
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,560
Then she fell to the ground suffering
spasms and foaming at the mouth as the

147
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,800
salesman panics. Little did he
knew that all across their street,

148
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,220
others were collapsing to dying
before their loved one's eyes.

149
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,030
In all that commotion, No one
noticed the van driving quietly away.

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,610
The van was registered to arm Shinrikyo.

151
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,140
This van I saw horror had
ordered modifying to emis
clouds of deadly nerve gas,

152
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,000
the 1994 and that's a moto incident,
killed eight people and left 500 injured.

153
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,810
It was the first major terrorist action
by Oh and the first terrorist attack

154
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,840
ever carried out with siren,
but it didn't come from nowhere.

155
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,250
Over the last half decade.

156
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,660
Ahmed metamorphosed from Amea Doomsday
cults into one of the most dangerous

157
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,790
terrorist organizations on earth.

158
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,960
The Ross had started back in 1989
just as Tokyo was recognizing it isn't

159
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,670
official religion.
That February,

160
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:52,230
a young man named Shuji tag Gucci hat
trying to leave the cult rather than let

161
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,110
them go as a horror,
ordered him strangled to death.

162
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,890
No long off relatives of all members
that banded together to find a police

163
00:09:58,891 --> 00:09:59,490
complaints.

164
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,660
A young lawyer named Tsutsumi sack a moto
took the case and lead to disappear in

165
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:04,141
November,

166
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:08,070
along with his wife and their newborn
baby at laser emerge that all members had

167
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:11,340
beaten all three of them to death
and buried their bodies in a forest.

168
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,880
When police investigated home sympathizers
on the force destroyed evidence that

169
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,300
could have convicted as a horror by
now as a whole row was on his way to

170
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:22,560
becoming a Japanese. Charles Manson
completes with a dodgy bid and hack us,

171
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,030
but one event was about to send him
further into murderous insanity.

172
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,950
This even Manson could
have only dreamed of.

173
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,400
In February,

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,110
1990 Japan went to the polls to elect a
new governments as Sohara made sure 24

175
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:42,550
own members were on the ballot.

176
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,420
This would be the first step in his
plan to become king once Almaden to the

177
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:48,460
Japanese Diet that you know,
stopping them.

178
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,130
That was just one tragic flaw with this.

179
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,880
The public did not like
option Rikkyo one little bit.

180
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,540
When the results came in Ohms,

181
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:01,541
24 candidates at scraped together a
lousy 1,700 votes given mom had nearly 10

182
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:06,520
times as many adherence.
This was a seriously pathetic
outcome. Overnight as a,

183
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,700
I became the laughing stock of Tokyo.
Now in an ideal,

184
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:12,550
well this is where as a
horror story would end,

185
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,790
but here's the thing about
laughingstocks humiliating them.

186
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,680
It's rally the ends as the
often misattributed quote
goes first they ignore you,

187
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,280
then they laugh at you, then
they fight you, then you win.

188
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,210
And with his dreams of being
king shattered as a horror,

189
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,080
it was now ready to fight.
He started by modifying his prophecies.

190
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:34,540
He now told followers the
world would end the following,

191
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:39,541
a chemical weapon attack in 1995 evac job
when I was to make that attack happen.

192
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,380
So alm change tack,

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,670
they began using members who worked in
government labs to stockpile botulism

194
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,150
anthrax.
They sent a team to Zaire,

195
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,280
now the Democratic Republic of
the Congo to collected Bola.

196
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,210
They started selling illegal drugs,
fund their activities,

197
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,060
hiring the Yakuza to provide the muscle.
Within two months of the elections,

198
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,030
all launched their first
attack using the modified van.

199
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:04,510
The group released botulism into the
air outside of the Japanese Diet.

200
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,200
The attack fails because they used a
harmless strain pattern that would repeat

201
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,560
two years later when they tried to spray
anthrax over Tokyo from the top of a

202
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,390
skyscraper.
Unfortunately,

203
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,720
the same couldn't be said for their
experiments with Seran back in.

204
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:19,120
Kc Hides the Asha you could
call know called the police,

205
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,920
begging them to save his wife.

206
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,090
Instead they arrested him and charged him
with using Seren to killers, neighbors.

207
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,750
We can only imagine how as a higher must
have laughed to himself when he heard

208
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:32,560
the news.
It was in 1994 and only seemed invincible

209
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,330
in the nine months between the Matsumoto
incidents and the Tokyo subway attack.

210
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,080
Ohm went certifiably insane by now.

211
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:49,260
The group was convinced
doomsday was mayor months away,

212
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,740
that the world was out to get them and
that they needed to act fast to bring

213
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:53,760
about the apocalypse.

214
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,000
The tails of that time are so crazy
that that seemed like fantasy.

215
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,860
If we didn't know that they were true.

216
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,450
There's the way I'm set up his own factory
dedicated to producing AK 47 the way

217
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:07,230
they managed to steal plans
for constructing tanks
and heavy artillery from a

218
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:11,400
military contractor the way
they successfully smuggled
and attack helicopter

219
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,460
into Japan from Russia as his army
ants. Fire power grew, so did us.

220
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,670
A horror is boldness.

221
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,670
In late 1994 he ordered the
assassination of an ex cultist with VX,

222
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,470
the same chemical weapon used by North
Korea to assassinate Kim Jong moons

223
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,190
dissident brother.

224
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,780
In 2017 in February of 1995 he ended
at Japanese official kidnaps and

225
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,700
incinerated alive and a specially built
oven that same month he ordered his

226
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,690
troops do summarily executed nine old
members. He suspected of disloyalty.

227
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,560
All nine were hanged and coordinators
with the ashes being thrown in a lake,

228
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,440
and believe me,
it gets even crazier.

229
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,590
In 1993 Ahmed purchased a ranch in
Australia that was home to a uranium mine.

230
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,220
By 1994 they were actively planning to
extract the uranium and build a dirty

231
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:56,880
bomb.

232
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,480
There's even some evidence the cults
plan to attack in New York's World Trade

233
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,310
Center.
In short,

234
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,310
I'm in early 1995 was a military fighting
force prepared to do battle and die

235
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,990
for that leader with Japanese authorities
still turning a blind eye to the group.

236
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:14,520
They could probably have carried out any
number of atrocities that, as a horror,

237
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,260
hadn't forgotten his prophecy.

238
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,490
He had said five days ago that the world
would end with chemical weapons and

239
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,850
knew how to make it happen.
Now it's on their Australian ranch.

240
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:28,070
Cultists for all of them had been testing
increasingly deadly types of siren on

241
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,930
sheep. As production moved
to that Japanese compounds,

242
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:34,830
the group now had enough of the Nazi
nerve gas to kill millions of people.

243
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,780
They just needed somewhere to release it,

244
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,890
to bring about the apocalypse and
that's somewhere was of course the Tokyo

245
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:45,891
subway in March of 1995 as a horror
took five of his followers aside as Eg

246
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,960
Hirosi Toro, Toyota Masato
Yaki Yammer. Yes, who you are.

247
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,280
Hi Yoshi and decor you
high listened attentively.

248
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,400
That master spelled out his grand plan
in a few days' time old within the world

249
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,550
and they would have the honor of being
as a horror is five horsemen of the

250
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,384
apocalypse.

251
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,020
7:30 AM on March the 20th 1995
30 year olds can eg Hirosi.

252
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,760
You got on board to the Tokyo subway
is Marinucci line headed for Sucky Igi

253
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,410
station,

254
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,900
a shy young man with the Dorky pair of
glasses and as an umbrella cluttered in

255
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:21,441
one hands.

256
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:25,580
No one paid any attention to him as he
took a seat and placed a plastic bag on

257
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:29,060
the floor shortly before 8:00 AM is the
train ends at the government districts.

258
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,230
Hirosi calmly tapped his umbrella twice,
puncturing his plastic bag.

259
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,260
He got up and Texas is vanishing
into the morning muscle.

260
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,910
Just another face in the anonymous
Tokyo crowd across the subway network.

261
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,700
Toyota Yaka Yammer ruins
the too high he she is.

262
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,320
We're doing the exact same thing.

263
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,290
It never even occurred to
anyone to stop them as heroes.

264
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,310
He's trained lurched off
to its next destination.
Someone noticed a funny smell,

265
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,550
chemical whiff as the train rolled on,
commute is trapped inside,

266
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:58,310
began to fill ill to notice
them vision and giving funny.

267
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,140
By the time it pulled
in to the next station,

268
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,050
it was clear that something
was seriously wrong as Esea.

269
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,630
2:00 AM the first alarm went up on
the heavier line drain poisoned by.

270
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,900
So hey you,
she people were vomiting blood.

271
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,170
Others were having fits as the news
of the problem reached the subway

272
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,060
authorities.
They made a fateful decision.

273
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,850
They decided to shut
down the effective lions.

274
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,360
The results was Sarah unfilled trains
becoming stuck between stations,

275
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,330
the people on board traps and
like wraps and a deadly box.

276
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,540
As the gas seeps out to
fill first cars then trains.

277
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,650
Hundreds of people were poisons and
then thousands with nowhere to run.

278
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:31,550
Survivors panicked,

279
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,840
desperately trying to escape death in
those black and claustrophobic tunnels.

280
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,921
At one station,

281
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:40,700
three subway employees bravely tried
to remove a Sarah and package by hands

282
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,150
within minutes. Two of them were dad.
As commuters ran for the surface.

283
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,410
They brought the siren with them,
clinging to their clothes like a disease.

284
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:49,310
It spread from person to person poisoning.

285
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:53,030
Thousands more bodies piled up in
the streets outside of stations.

286
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,360
Paramedics who ran to treat the
wounded were themselves affected.

287
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,510
That nervous systems attacked
by an invisible killer.

288
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,630
In that morning's carnival of Horace Mann,
he would go blinds.

289
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,590
Many would suffer brain damage and many
would die. It was the bloodiest day.

290
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,250
Japan's capital.
How to work in too.

291
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:12,230
Since the firebombing of
Tokyo in 1945 at that moment,

292
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,970
it must have really seems like the end
of the world are truly arrived. Luckily,

293
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:19,910
he has a horror. He had already
seen the seeds of its own downfall.

294
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,420
Do you remember that whole Matsumoto
incident from about five minutes ago when

295
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,970
own poison, that entire
suburb with Seran? Well,

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,260
Hiroshi Merita had been on the front
lines treating that attack and had since

297
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,720
become Japan's leading authority
on Sarah and poisoning.

298
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,610
When news broke from Tokyo about a
mysterious gas poisoning commuters,

299
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,410
he immediately put two and two
together with frightening speed.

300
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,590
He frantically called in,
faxed every single hospital in Tokyo,

301
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,040
sending them detailed instructions
for treating Seren poisoning.

302
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,590
Since Aaron can take hours
to kill or disable you,

303
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,400
it's thought of Marita's actions
saved many lives, but not all of them.

304
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,510
By the time the sunsets on Japan's
Day of terror, 12 people would debt,

305
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,520
dozens have been permanently disabled
and somewhere in the region of 6,000

306
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:05,250
people had been poisoned
10 years after the attack.

307
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,890
It would be estimated that
around 30% of those injured,

308
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,070
we're still suffering with the
effects of Sarah and poisoning.

309
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,750
One study claimed that 60% of those
gas experienced permanent damage for

310
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:19,380
Japanese authorities. The Tokyo
subway attack. It was a wake up call.

311
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,420
There was no longer any
doubt to there's um,

312
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:25,620
we're involved in to know amounts of
friends in the police could save a Sahara.

313
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,650
Now it was time to take down the cultist

314
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,860
the days after on siren attack.

315
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,660
We're living through a dream less than
48 hours after Kenichi Hirosi punctured

316
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:45,920
his bag of Seren, a series of coordinated
police raids, saw alm, compounds rated,

317
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:50,210
and 200 cultists arrested facilities
for producing Seren mustard gas.

318
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:55,130
Anthrax and Vieques was seized along with
enough weapons to start a war shocked

319
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:59,360
by the southern police attention. The
cult hit back hard. On march the 30th,

320
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:02,970
the head of the National Police Agency
was shot and nearly killed mine home

321
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:03,710
assassin.

322
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,880
Two weeks later to sympathize sympathizers
released a cloud of fostering gas at

323
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,470
the Oklahoma station,
injuring 400 people.

324
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,460
But it wasn't until may the fifth that
I'm really trying to get their revenge.

325
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,360
That morning of cyanide bomb was left
below, add dockets in some Juku station.

326
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,410
There was enough gas in it to kill
20,000 people through shift fluke,

327
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,830
the designator malfunctions and it
wouldn't be Tokyo's lost and miss. Well,

328
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:30,831
may the 16th 1995 [inaudible] was finally
found hiding inside of fake wall and

329
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,820
oms headquarters. Although he was
arrested, the attacks didn't stop.

330
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,750
His 13 year old daughter Rico was made
leader and instituted a reign of shocking

331
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:42,380
abuse and torture that surpassed
even a father that same evening,

332
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,200
and I'm not a bomb,
nearly killed the governor of Tokyo.

333
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,140
Finally on July the fourth 1995 not four
months after the subway attack ohms,

334
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,370
last gasp came for hydrogen.

335
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:55,790
Cyanide bombs were left and
subway stations across Tokyo.

336
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,870
Together they would have killed somewhere
in the region of 100,000 people,

337
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,950
but once again, those detonators
failed broken by repeated raids.

338
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:07,580
Their teenage dictator now taken
into care on scattered the groups,

339
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,240
high ranking members. They all went on
the run scattering to the four winds.

340
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,130
The last fugitive member
wouldn't be captured until
2000 and 12,000 [inaudible].

341
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,180
It was the end of the line.

342
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,440
Has Trial began in 1996 just as the
one rich on declared bankruptcy.

343
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,110
It lasted an incredible eight years
for the first four years as a higher ed

344
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,210
disrupted proceedings by making long,
rambling speeches,

345
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:32,830
claiming a miracle would see them.
That's even as legendary charisma.

346
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,771
It couldn't help him.

347
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:37,940
Now in 2000 to Sro seemed to
recognize this and do you fell silent.

348
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,400
He wouldn't speak again
for the rest of his life.

349
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,260
In 2004 as a hydro is finally sentenced
to death by hanging is law has failed to

350
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:48,850
file appeals,
and in 2006 the sentence was upheld.

351
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,210
Not Two years later as a horror
had a sort of mental collapse.

352
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,460
He stopped all contact with
his family and followers.

353
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,680
He stopped eating and that's,
he was spoonfed.

354
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,100
He refused to use the toilets and
instead took to wearing an adult diaper,

355
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:03,470
soiling himself in silence in
a gloomy corner of his cell,

356
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,720
defeated and forgotten.
He stayed like that for the next decade.

357
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,350
On July the sixth 2018 God's
led as a horror from his cell.

358
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,180
Now it's into the yards alongside
six other armed cultists,

359
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,900
so he hadn't seen for 12 years.

360
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,620
It's impossible to know what the other
cultists fell. Seeing him in that moment,

361
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,310
seeing the man who'd ones bend to
them and off of Tokyo, to his will,

362
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:28,360
reduced to a silent living corpse.
Do they feel remorse?

363
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,800
Did they see him for the false gods
that he always was? We'll never know.

364
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,570
All seven were hangs that morning.

365
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,480
Their families only alerted
after they were already dead.

366
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,710
They were cremated inside the prison.
Their bodies burned is that once burned,

367
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:42,880
those of their victims,

368
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,240
when news of [inaudible] death reached
the media and most living outside of

369
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:50,770
Japan kind of just shrugged and
we're like, who? Yes. Even now,

370
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,431
his story,

371
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:55,990
it might not be over in 2000 just as as
a horror was falling into his catatonic

372
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:59,730
state. Oh, officially renounced
him breaking into two offshoots.

373
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,170
The majority renamed themselves and leaf.

374
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,100
They set up a fund to compensate oms
victims and swore to become peaceful,

375
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,190
but they never complete these
succeeded in exercising as a horror.

376
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,430
Today there are around
1,500 eleaf members.

377
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,300
Journalists reported that many
who still live surrounded by us,

378
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,240
a Horace teachings,

379
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,390
reading his books and decorating
their homes with portraits of him.

380
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,580
Although under surveillance
by Japanese authorities,

381
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,600
they continue to worship the cultists
to tried to destroy the wells and then

382
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:26,380
also loan.

383
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,610
In 2016 the tiny European nation of
months and Negro expelled a 58 foreign is

384
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,090
suspected of being members of home,
although forward Japanese,

385
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,460
the majority were Russians.
That same year,

386
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:40,600
Russian authorities busted 25 compounds
operated by the group of prosecutors of

387
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:44,920
warms that there may be up to 30,000
Russians currently involved with the cult.

388
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,300
The BBC has since reports.

389
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,070
If the group operating and Bellaruse and
Ukraine shockware Sahara, maybe debt,

390
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,140
but his influence, it clearly
remains. While there's no evidence,

391
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:57,340
his remaining followers, a
planning, more terrorist atrocities,

392
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,450
they still worship the man who
once brought Tokyo to its knees.

393
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,560
For a man as charismatic as,
as a horror,

394
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,690
it seems his knocked legacy
extends even beyond the grave.

395
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,670
