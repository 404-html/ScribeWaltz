1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,430
He is recognized as the greatest athletes
of modern times in the boxing ring,

2
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:08,450
that he was nothing short of superb
punishing his opponent so well and it was

3
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:12,920
outside of the ring that he would have
his greatest battles and show the world

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,900
what it really meant to be a man.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,250
And this episode of Biographics,

6
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:20,300
we discovered what it was that made
a Mohammad Ali the absolute greatest.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,360
It's just a job.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,081
Grass grows,

9
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,210
birds fly waves pounding the sand.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,403
I'd beat people up.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,340
Cassius Marcellus clay was born on
January the 17th of 1942 in Louisville,

12
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:46,120
Kentucky.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,750
His father,

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,100
Cassius Sr was it east sign paints out
while his mother Adesa worked as a maid

15
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,970
for a wealthy White Family in Louisville
are precocious but polite child.

16
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,080
Young Cassius was raised as a god
fearing baptist along with his younger

17
00:00:59,081 --> 00:00:59,381
brother,

18
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,060
Rudy and his younger years.

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,850
He gave no indication
to his athletic future.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,290
He steered clear of sports,

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,360
preferring to play marbles with Rudy Ball,

22
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:11,020
read comic books on his bed in
1954 when he was 12 years old,

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,740
Casios and a friend rode their
bicycles to the Columbia Auditorium,

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,840
which was hosting the
Louisville home show.

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,350
They spent the afternoon checking out
the wares of various African American

26
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:24,720
merchants and gorging themselves on the
Free Popcorn and candy that was on offer

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,900
when they emerge from the exhibition.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,550
The boys were dismayed to discover the
Cassius as brands new red and white.

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,590
A Schwinn bike was missing the why.

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,250
Well,

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,120
it had been stolen.

32
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,320
Cassius was absolutely livid
with rage drawing an upset.

33
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,780
He began asking people if
they'd seen who took his bike.

34
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,890
A woman suggested that he reported the
theft to officer Joe Martin who operated

35
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:47,470
a boxing gym in a nearby basement finding.

36
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,660
Martin Cassius explained
to what has happened.

37
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,200
I think that he was going to
wobble whoever had taken his bike,

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,600
Marta,

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,540
and it had been teaching
boxing for decades,

40
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,640
asked if the boy knew how to fight.

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,230
When Cassius admitted this,

42
00:01:59,231 --> 00:01:59,950
he didn't.

43
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,740
The officers suggested
that maybe he has a learn.

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,971
Well this,

45
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,660
this was the beginning of a long
friendship and to Glorious Korea,

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,813
Huh?

47
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,531
Cassius.

48
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:22,310
He threw himself into boxing training
with a passion and commitment that

49
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,270
impressed Martin.

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,550
Although we had it very
little natural skill,

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,280
he had more heart than
anyone else in the gym.

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,140
It raced to the gym as soon as school let
out and would train even on Saturdays.

53
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,650
Martin had simply never seen a kid
work quite so hot outside of the gym.

54
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,880
Cassius stayed away from anything that
would interfere with his training.

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,020
He was displaying the
kind of determination and
discipline that was lacking in

56
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:48,290
many of the older boxes
that Martin coached Martin.

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,520
He introduced Cassius to at local boxing
trainer named Fred stoner who helped

58
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:56,300
teach him the fundamentals of the sport
under the guidance of these two men,

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,260
young play began winning one man.

60
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,910
What about after another
month after month,

61
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,870
year after year,

62
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,990
a handful of amateur winds
built up a formidable records.

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,980
By the age of 18 he had won 108 bouts,

64
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,010
six Kentucky Golden Glove Championships
and two national Aau titles in the ring.

65
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,230
Cassius absolutely fearless.

66
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,070
He carried a self confidence and a belief
in his ability that put his opponents

67
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:24,000
off guard before the first
ground bell met even sounds it,

68
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,760
but this was in great contrast to his
personal life because there he really

69
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,594
struggles.

70
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,810
It was a poor student with teachers
unable to understand why he couldn't

71
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,500
transfer the dedication you put
into his sport into his studies.

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,530
No one realized at the time that has
struggles in school they would do to the

73
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,040
reading disability dyslexia in
February of 1957 professional boxer,

74
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,910
but Willie Per Strano visited
Louisville with his trainer,

75
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,170
Angelo Dundee Cassius found out where
he was staying and phoned for Strano his

76
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:50,970
hotel room.

77
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,900
If I was picked up by done deep,

78
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,800
Cassius blurted out that he was going to
be the world's greatest boxer and that

79
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,500
he wanted to meet for Strano
with nothing on their schedule.

80
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,470
That afternoon done the infrastructure
actually invited Cassius.

81
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you have a hotel room
for the next several hours?

82
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:09,070
Cassius peppered Australia with questions
only pausing long enough to predict

83
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,090
his own future.

84
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,950
Greatness of amused Angelo.

85
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,960
Dundee was impressed with the boy ends.

86
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,813
Kept in touch with him.

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,430
He's sometimes since Cassius and his
family free tickets when one of his boxes

88
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,750
had a fight in lines up in Louisville.

89
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,930
In March,

90
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,080
1959 Cassius was training
in a gym in Chicago,

91
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:35,970
Illinois prior to an Aau talks bout,

92
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,340
yeah,

93
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,770
the hood.

94
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,600
Some other boxes talking about a group
called the nation of Islam who were re

95
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,560
spousing black pride back.

96
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:43,310
I'm in Louisville.

97
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,730
He decided to learn more about the
group by doing a school assignment about

98
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:47,150
them.

99
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,570
However,

100
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,310
his teacher shut the idea down,

101
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,940
telling him that the group was dangerous
and that they preached hatred against

102
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,080
all white people.

103
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,770
Play,

104
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,340
however,

105
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,920
was still intrigued by
the nation of Islam.

106
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,120
He got ahold of a copy of a newspaper
that they put out and started reading as

107
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,110
much as he could about them.

108
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,250
At the same time,

109
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,140
he was wrestling with the weighty
decision about what direction to take his

110
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,230
boxing future.

111
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,340
People that have been talking him up as
a hot prospect for the 1960 Olympics in

112
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:13,880
Rome,

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,180
but at that time only amateurs are
able to compete in the Olympics,

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,320
so he had to decide if he was going to
town professional or compete in Rome as

115
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,630
part of the United States is boxing team.

116
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,680
It was at this point 30 turned to
his friend Angelo Dundee for advice,

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,390
don't told Cassius that he could earn
more money as a pro if he was an Olympic

118
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:32,901
champion.

119
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:33,530
First.

120
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,101
As a result,

121
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,400
he decided to stay in his amateur
career runs compete in the Olympics.

122
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:37,731
Well,

123
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,490
at the time the American Olympic
team was set to depart for Italy.

124
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,810
Playing was in peak physical condition
and mentally primed for victory,

125
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,330
but there was one slight problem.

126
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
He was absolutely terrified at
the prospect of flying on a plane.

127
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,400
In fact,

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,970
he was so terrified that he always passed
up the opportunity to represent his

129
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:56,804
country.

130
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,020
He,

131
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,050
he finally relented when it's old
mentor Joe Martin convinced him to fly.

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,840
We think parachute on his back.

133
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,490
Fortunately it Cassius,

134
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,440
it didn't need to operate
as parachutes in the plane.

135
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,510
Touched down in room
without any incidents.

136
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,100
He started as an employee campaign with
a quick two rounds when over Belgium's

137
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,440
Yvonne,

138
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,890
because that wind was followed by another
win over the Soviet Union's getting

139
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:17,900
reduced shat cough.

140
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,440
He was the previous gold medal
winner at the 1956 Olympics.

141
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,050
Cassius then triumphed in the semifinals,

142
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,180
defeating Australia's Antony Madigan.

143
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,470
The only person standing between play
and Olympic glory was Poland's is a big

144
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,500
new patters as Koski in
the contrast of Cassius,

145
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,330
who would only been boxing for six years.

146
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,390
This man was a three time
European champion and even
at one bronze in the 1956

147
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,540
Olympics.

148
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,901
However,

149
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,150
it was clay who played
the more aggressive game,

150
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,110
throwing an avalanche of punches to take
the first round lead the Polish champ.

151
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,470
Well,

152
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,620
he was simply unable to recover
and at the ends of three rounds,

153
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,540
Cassius claimed the Olympic,

154
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,150
a light heavyweight gold metal gaseous.

155
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,750
He returns to Louisville eight local
hero with even the mayor turning out to

156
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,530
receive him.

157
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,610
He was so proud of his victory that
he wore his gold medal everywhere.

158
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,200
About a week after his return,

159
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,900
he had a friend's doctor into our
restaurant to get out of the rain.

160
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,990
That's when they tried to order a
couple of cheeseburgers and milkshakes.

161
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,290
They were told that the restaurants did
not serve black people and they were

162
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,124
thrown out.

163
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,470
Cassius clay was an Olympic champion.

164
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:18,980
Yes,

165
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,210
it was still a second class citizen
in his hometown standing on the second

166
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:23,900
street bridge.

167
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,010
He grabbed his gold medal,

168
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,980
ripped it from his neck and
threw it into the Ohio river.

169
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,330
Despite his frustration
with the social climates,

170
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,350
Cassius was facing a bright boxing
future turning professional.

171
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:47,710
He was sponsored by a group of local
white businessmen who agreed to sponsor

172
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,130
him.

173
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,150
They offered to pay him at $10,000 up
front and to cover all of his training

174
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:52,984
expenses.

175
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,620
In return,

176
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,470
they would take half his
earnings for the next six years.

177
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,750
Despite these impressive
victories in Rome,

178
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:01,390
boxing pundits didn't expect
a great career for clay.

179
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,640
The consensus was that
he had quick footwork,

180
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
but not much else.

181
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,100
He spent too much energy.

182
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,170
They said dancing around the ring man's.

183
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,910
When he lands back to protect his face,

184
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,590
he would leave his body exposed.

185
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,011
However,

186
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:16,350
Cassius relied on his long reach to strike
his opponents from a distance gaseous

187
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:16,511
well.

188
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,790
He wanted to train under Angelo Dundee,

189
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,900
but as sponsors sent him to California
to work with a trainer by the name of

190
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,920
Archie Moore.

191
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,770
He made his pro debut in front of his
home crowd on October the 29th of 1960 his

192
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,920
opponent was Tonya,

193
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:33,820
hadn't sacco clay one the fights
with a unanimous six round decision.

194
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,680
It was a great start to his pro career,

195
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,230
but to clay.

196
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,440
Wasn't happy with Archie Moore,

197
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:38,280
his training style,

198
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:42,600
and he headed to Miami and doest Angelo
Dundee to take over as his trainer dumb.

199
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,331
He agrees,

200
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:46,000
but it meant the Cassius had to live
in a very rough neighborhood that was

201
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,250
filled with gangs and
drugs and prostitution.

202
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,000
Still,

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,420
he took immediately to his new training
environments flourishing under the

204
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:53,590
tutelage of date.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,520
By now,

206
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,800
it became evident that Cassius was an
absolutely masterful self promoter.

207
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,430
In fact,

208
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,000
his mouth,

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,530
it worked faster than his fists.

210
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,780
He never tired of announcing
that he was the greatest,

211
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,650
the prettiest,

212
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,320
and the fastest athlete
to ever step into a ring.

213
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,340
But he was soon encouraged
to talk himself up even more.

214
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,510
In June of 1961 clay travel to
Las Vegas for a boxing match.

215
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,350
While in Vegas,

216
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,670
you went to see a wrestler by the name
of Gorgeous George Cassius watched as

217
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:22,470
George acted outrageously.

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,250
He was trash talking his opponent for
an upcoming match he talked to endlessly

219
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:27,100
before band,

220
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,290
even during the match,

221
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,070
the whole crowd,

222
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,690
well that made them
read for the other guy.

223
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,621
But after the match,

224
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,360
Cassius met George backstage.

225
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,020
The rest of their explained that is self
promotion was designed to get as many

226
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:40,650
people as possible to pay to come
and see someone shut his mouth.

227
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,600
He advised clay to keep sassing his
opponents and to always be outrageous.

228
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,410
He also told him to find himself a
gimmick that would set himself apart.

229
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:49,891
Well,

230
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:50,191
clay,

231
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,390
he soon found his gimmick.

232
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,220
He would predict the round
that he would win the match him

233
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,371
well.

234
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,670
November the 15th 1962 Cassius
met his former trainer,

235
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:08,750
Archie Moore in the ring,

236
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,800
but bold claims that
he had developed a lip,

237
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:11,210
a button,

238
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,631
a punch,

239
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:16,070
do finally silence the Louisville lip
as Cassius had come to be known in

240
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:16,761
response play,

241
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,350
predicted a fourth round knock outs,

242
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,070
bands.

243
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,990
That is precisely how the fight went down.

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,651
Cassius,

245
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:25,280
he was now a 16 when zero loss pro,

246
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,780
he felt he had an under shot at the
heavyweight world champion Sonny Liston.

247
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,500
He engaged upon a campaign of taunting
list and into taking the challenge.

248
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,970
They began referring to the champ as a
big ugly bear once even travel to his

249
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,230
home town of Springfield,

250
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,160
Colorado and banged on his door at three
in the morning to call out the champ

251
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,791
clay.

252
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:48,020
He made absolutely sure the TV cameras
were recording every second of this

253
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:48,710
charade.

254
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,580
Finally listed,

255
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:49,910
well,

256
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,880
he had had enough and he
agreed to take on the upstart.

257
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,840
The heavyweight champ made a prediction
of his own and that would be pain.

258
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,160
There was no idle threats.

259
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,580
Listing was a mountain of a
man who had a killer punch.

260
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,420
He was considered by many
boxing experts to be unbeatable.

261
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,290
Cassius,

262
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,430
he trained hard for this,

263
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,050
the biggest fight of his life,

264
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,510
but he didn't give it his absolute focus.

265
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,130
Both Cassius and his brother,

266
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:13,640
Rudy,

267
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,090
they were becoming increasingly
interested in the nation of Islam.

268
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,020
They started attending meetings and
Cassius became enamored with the leader

269
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,040
Elijah Muhammad.

270
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,410
He also took a great liking
to the group spokesman,

271
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,363
knock Max.

272
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,520
As the brothers started spending
more time at the mosque in Miami,

273
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,750
Malcolm told Cassius to where his nation
of Islam membership proudly when the

274
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,810
title find sponsors learned that the
challenger was associating with the nation

275
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:36,470
of Islam.

276
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,220
They threatened to cancel the event
unless he disavowed the grip it's played.

277
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,650
He would not abandon his newfound faith.

278
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,700
He was prepared to walk away from
boxing to stay true to himself.

279
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,211
Well,

280
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:47,721
the sponsors,

281
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:50,120
they ultimately backed
down and the fight he did.

282
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:50,900
Go ahead.

283
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,561
Now listen.

284
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,240
He was used to knocking out opponents,

285
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,213
the early rounds,

286
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,880
but clay,

287
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,900
he was too fast.

288
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,651
It's quick feet,

289
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,640
danced around the ring.

290
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,050
Anz Liston was simply unable to touch
him after a grueling six rounds.

291
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,710
Liston,

292
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,910
he refused to come out for the seventh
the 22 year old Cassius clay was now the

293
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:10,930
youngest heavyweight champ in
history as razor sharp canon is.

294
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,590
When was it was superseded the very next
day when he officially announced that

295
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:18,010
he was a member of the nation of Islam
and that he was changing his name to

296
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
Cassius x.

297
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,050
A week later,

298
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,940
that evolved into Muhammad Ali,

299
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,930
the nation of Islam.

300
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,450
They were very unpopular
with most of America.

301
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,680
It was predicted this,

302
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,580
if he fought list,

303
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,210
and again,

304
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,160
there wouldn't be anyone rooting for him.

305
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:30,701
Well,

306
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:35,530
the two they did meet again on May the
25th 1965 many in the anxious crowds.

307
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,850
They expect it to see Liston win back the
title that he had lost Ali and instead

308
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:43,930
they were stunned to see the former champ
again knocked out in the first rounds.

309
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,850
On November the 22nd 1965 Ali successfully
defended his title against former

310
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,180
champ,

311
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,110
Floyd Patterson.

312
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,950
Patterson had spoken out against the
nation of Islam and refuse to call alley

313
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,240
buying his Muslim name,

314
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,130
Ali.

315
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,710
They didn't pay for this slight
mercilessly pounding him while yelling.

316
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,830
Watched my na in 1966 alley defended his
title five times four of those defenses

317
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,200
being held outside of the United States.

318
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,740
On February the sixth 1967
he fought it Ernie to realm.

319
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:12,461
Then Houston,

320
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,750
Texas to rail was enraged dally buying
just like Floyd Patterson before him

321
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,880
refusing the call only by his name.

322
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,870
The result was what many believe to be
the worst beating ever dished out in a

323
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,490
professional boxing match.

324
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,850
The champion tortured DRL
it for the full 15 rounds,

325
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,960
bringing him up just short of a knockout
and then backing off only to wallop

326
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,670
them again with the combinations.

327
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,170
Ali won a unanimous points decision.

328
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,004
Yeah,

329
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,190
Holly's next bottle.

330
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,170
Would it pit him against the might
of the United States governments?

331
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,270
On April the 28th 1967 he turns up at
the Houston Induction Center for the US

332
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,170
armed forces.

333
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,500
When the time came for him to step forward
to signify signifying his induction,

334
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,850
Allie didn't move.

335
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,750
He explains that his religious beliefs
prevented him from joining the army and

336
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,940
killing people with
whom he had no quarrel.

337
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,380
He further stated that he could not in
good conscious give support to a war that

338
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:13,060
he felt was morally wrong.

339
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,450
Within 24 hours,

340
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,950
Sally had been stripped of his heavyweight
title as well as his license to box

341
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,710
in every state in the
country in an instant.

342
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
That title he had worked so
hard for was simply gone.

343
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,530
When the u s government
took away his passport,

344
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,620
couldn't even box oversees
the governments well.

345
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,990
They had effectively
taken away his livelihood.

346
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,590
However,

347
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,480
the champ was never going to lie down.

348
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,830
He became an unlikely hero to the millions
of young anti war activists around

349
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:39,664
the nation.

350
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,360
He spoke at the most
prestigious universities where
he was introduced as the

351
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:47,320
first national figure with the courage
to stand up against the war in Vietnam.

352
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,251
Still,

353
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:50,320
the late 1960s were lean years fanny.

354
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,430
On August 17th,

355
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,690
1967 he married Belinda Boyd,

356
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,100
but next year they had a child,

357
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,510
Merriam but Ali's name.

358
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,810
It brought him opportunities and
he managed to make ends meet.

359
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,940
He did everything from
opening a restaurant,

360
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:06,170
calls Champ Burgers to starring
in a musical big time buck white.

361
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,640
As the years passed,

362
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,820
Mohammad continued training and the
hope that one day I would get the

363
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,070
opportunity to reclaim his title.

364
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,821
Finally,

365
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,820
towards the end of the 1970s
some promoters in Georgia,

366
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:21,020
which didn't have the boxing commission
organized about against Jerry Quarry,

367
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,250
though slower than he had been Helene,

368
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,670
one in a convincing fashion is now.

369
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,040
Well other states they considered
to let him fight again.

370
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,990
If he could get another
win under his belt,

371
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,420
he might even get a shot at a
reigning champion of Joe Fraser.

372
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,311
Does it get up?

373
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:44,710
Fraser?

374
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,990
I'm Molly has a Festa feet.

375
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,830
Oscar Bonavena the fight
almost when the full 15 rounds,

376
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:52,380
we've Bonavena taking a
great deal of punishments,

377
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,890
but he also dish down to a level of
abuse that Mohammed had never had to

378
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:56,790
withstands before.

379
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,710
Sill Molly one in the last round.

380
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,780
Tko the fight of the century,

381
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,250
the first ever between two undefeated
heavyweight champs took place on March the

382
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:07,570
eighth 1971 phrasing Angelina.

383
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,120
It traded blow after blow five years
before that he would have easily dodged.

384
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:12,811
Some are phrases,

385
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:13,880
punches person.

386
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,040
Now he could only take the hits and
fight through the pain and the abuse,

387
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:17,940
the fight,

388
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,900
they went the distance.

389
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,250
It could have gone either way,

390
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,920
but in the end it was a
unanimous decision to Fraser,

391
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,150
Muhammad Ali.

392
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,210
He had suffered his first
professional loss still.

393
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,460
He was determined to get back on top.

394
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,430
He followed up is lost by
winning 10 fights in a row,

395
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,280
but it is 11th he was stopped
by the formidable can.

396
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,230
Norton who broke his jaw,

397
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,981
but Ali,

398
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,880
he came back in a rematch knocking out
Norton in the six rounds and ends up

399
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:42,421
after this.

400
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:46,950
Well that came the rematch that he was
really after he fought Joe Frazier who

401
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:50,490
had lost his title to George Foreman
for the second time on January the 28th

402
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:54,150
1974 winning in a 12
rounds unanimous decision.

403
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,261
But Ali,

404
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:55,680
well,

405
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,830
he still did not have his
title back to claim it.

406
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,480
He would have to defeat to the new champ.

407
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,510
This was the 24 year old foreman who would
so far at one 40 fights and just lost

408
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,580
eight hadn't gone past the
second rounds on paper.

409
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,690
It looked like the 32 year old
elite did not have a chance.

410
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,750
The fighter took place in consortia Zaia
on October the 30th 1974 over the early

411
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:18,601
rounds.

412
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:22,530
It appeared as if Ali was out of his depth
with form and apparently pounding him

413
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,280
at will.

414
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,120
What are the was actually doing was
allowing foreman to punch himself to

415
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,420
exhaustion and the
eight rounds at Mommy's,

416
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,670
it came to life and delivered
a devastating series of blows.

417
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,380
The put foreman on the canvas the champion
had reclaimed is heavyweight title.

418
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,401
A year later,

419
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:41,490
he faced drew Fraser for the third
time and he believed that this was the

420
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:45,690
hardest fought heavyweights clash
of all time rounds after rounds.

421
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,180
The stunned crowd watched in horror as
the battered boxes somehow fought beyond

422
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,120
exhaustion and the ends ballet was
declared the winner in the 14th rounds.

423
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,500
He was so exhausted that he
couldn't even stand up to celebrate.

424
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,773
Yeah,

425
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,740
an aging all the defendant,

426
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:13,120
his title seven more times before squaring
up to an unknown challenger by the

427
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:18,121
name of Leon Spinks on February the
15th 1978 I'll leave underestimated the

428
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,550
challenger training lightly and it's
not taking the fight seriously enough.

429
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,120
That night he lost his title to a man
who didn't deserve to be in the ring with

430
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,020
him at his prime.

431
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,010
Eight months later to smoke obvious
signs of developing Parkinson's disease,

432
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,790
he avenged the loss to claim an
unprecedented third world heavyweight

433
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,624
championship.

434
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,553
Nine months later,

435
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,670
he retired from the ring,

436
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,270
but is time out of the ring
would last for less than a year.

437
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,200
On October the 18th 1980 he suffered
a crushing defeat at the hands of his

438
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,370
former sparring partner.

439
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,420
30 homes.

440
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,380
A year later,

441
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,370
he was dispatched by a far less
impressive Trevor Burdick time.

442
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,750
Well,

443
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,980
it had finally caught up with
Mohammed Ali over the next decade,

444
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,370
has Parkinson's disease
steadily got worse?

445
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,120
The body that had served him so
well was giving up on him still,

446
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,170
he wasn't done yet.

447
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,520
In the late 1980s Mohammed Ali embarked
on a new career as a humanitarian

448
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,370
statesmen and its promotion
of Tolerance and peace weld,

449
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:09,800
right?

450
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,470
But at the time he left us on June the
third 2016 he was recognized as one of

451
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:18,670
the great men and certainly the
greatest athlete of the 20th century.

452
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,560
