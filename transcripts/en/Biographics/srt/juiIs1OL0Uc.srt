1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,930
It is no secret that Amazon Dotcom is
dominating multiple aspects of our daily

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:05,560
lives.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,210
We can find just about everything we
could possibly need on their site,

4
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,480
and if you've got Amazon Prime Yoni,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,760
wait two days for free
delivery for our digital media.

6
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:17,320
We can read books on kindle,

7
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,000
listen to music on Alexa,

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,570
and we can also watch on
demand movies and TV series.

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,280
This all started with an idea that
exploded into a digital revolution.

10
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,950
So who is the man behind
the trillion dollar company?

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:30,401
Well,

12
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:35,140
on today's episode of Biographics
we're talking about Jeff Bezos.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,140
Yeah.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,670
On January the twelfth,

15
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:49,061
19,

16
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:54,061
64 or 17 year old girl named Jacqueline
gave birth to a baby boy named Jeffrey

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,031
Preston,

18
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,710
your cousin in Albuquerque,

19
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:57,550
New Mexico.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,180
She was married to Jevs biological father,

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,850
Ted August,

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,810
and for just a one year while she was
finishing earning a high school diploma,

23
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:05,770
but their relationship,

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,380
it was not meant to last
and they got a divorce.

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,690
Jacqueline later remarried,

26
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,200
a man named Mike Bezos,

27
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,800
who was a Cuban immigrants who are
to college scholarship in the US.

28
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,550
They have two children together and
they also gave jeff the last name.

29
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:19,384
Bezos.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,060
Jeff grew up in a very
loving and supportive family.

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,721
His step father,

32
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,051
Mike,

33
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,060
was very resourceful and hard working.

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,370
His motto was very loving and supportive,

35
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:31,420
and she was especially concerned about
making sure that our son got the best

36
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,440
education possible.

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,420
She bought jeff into a Montessori school.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,560
The idea behind this educational method
is to allow a child to excel in their

39
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:42,880
natural talents so they choose what they
want to learn at their own pace instead

40
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:46,570
of forcing every child to learn
the same things at the same time,

41
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,010
Jeff was extremely
focused on his schoolwork,

42
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,260
even from a young age.

43
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,810
After the allotted time
in each subject was up,

44
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,170
his teachers had a hard time getting
him to move on to the next topic in

45
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:56,621
preschool.

46
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:00,430
They had to pick him up while still
sitting in his chair and move him just to

47
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,630
break his concentration.

48
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,650
Jeff Bezos spent his summer vacations
living with his grandparents and helping

49
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,300
them run their ranch in Texas.

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,460
His grandparents own
didn't ask dream trailer,

51
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:12,460
so they would go on long road
trip vacations together as well.

52
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,420
During these trips,

53
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:17,830
he would find excuses to do math problems
on a scrap of paper like their average

54
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:21,760
gas mileage and how much they
were spending on groceries
even though he helped

55
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:23,080
around the ranch with the chores.

56
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:27,160
He did not particularly enjoy the
outdoors and do you prefer to watch TV and

57
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,060
read books.

58
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,350
At a very early age,

59
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:32,380
Jeff Bezos was showing
signs that he was a genius.

60
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,700
His grandfather was also
a very intelligent man and
he could see the potential

61
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:37,660
in Jeff's future,

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
so his grandfather gave him some very
valuable advice which stuck with him for

63
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:43,360
the rest of his life.

64
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,840
I explained it's harder
to be kind than clever.

65
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,100
Cleverness is a gift.

66
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,190
Kindness is a choice
and choices can be hot.

67
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,850
You can seduce yourself with
your gifts if you're not careful.

68
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,360
He spent the rest of his life reminding
himself that no matter how much he

69
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,110
accomplished,

70
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,390
he would try to stay down to us.

71
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,470
I tell him his mother allows him to
have a workshop in their garage where he

72
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,670
built a solar cooker.

73
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,630
Huffaker often even installed a
security alarm on his bedroom door.

74
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,180
He was competing in science fans,

75
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,360
reading science fiction,

76
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,930
and watching episodes of star trek
on TV when he was 10 years old,

77
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,880
he found a teletype
computer at his school.

78
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,960
He and his friends found out that there
was a star trek game preprogrammed into

79
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:23,620
the system.

80
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,090
Gold track 73,

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,150
so he and his friends used the
computer to play this game.

82
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,870
This sparked his interest in computer
programming and it would carry on for the

83
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,740
rest of his life.

84
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,471
Jeff Bays,

85
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,500
they started his first
business in high school.

86
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,780
He was disappointed by
the quality of its towns,

87
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:38,620
local summer camp,

88
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:42,310
where kids would just play games outside
most of the day and not really learning

89
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:42,790
anything.

90
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,700
So he founded a new camp
called the dream institute.

91
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,380
They announced kids from the fourth,

92
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:47,771
fifth,

93
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,850
and sixth grade to attends and focused
on teaching children about important

94
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,670
works of literature in a fun,

95
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,543
exciting way.

96
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,091
The business,

97
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,390
it was a success and many of these
kids who are doing that summer reading,

98
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,580
we'd go on to get better grades in school,

99
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,630
not surprisingly,

100
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,850
he was the Valedictorian
of his high school class,

101
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:08,320
and during his graduation speech he said
that he believed that a one day human

102
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,200
beings would colonize
space after graduation.

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,010
He attended Princeton University and
earned a degree in computer science.

104
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,920
His first job was at a
startup called fit out.

105
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,731
While he worked there,

106
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:22,810
he was expected to fly between New York
and London nearly every week in order to

107
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,680
get his job done,

108
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,210
which was costing the company a tremendous
amount of money he ran is that this

109
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,400
was not the most efficient
way to run a business,

110
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,360
and it got into thinking about all the
different things that he would do more

111
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,330
efficiently if he got to run
his own company in the future.

112
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,550
His next job was at bankers trust,

113
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,580
which gave him some experience
in the financial industry.

114
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,091
Next,

115
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,990
he works for an investment firm
on Wall Street called De Shaw.

116
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,200
He helps to develop software
for trading stocks online.

117
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,310
As the years went on,

118
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,240
Jeff Bezos was staying on top of the
news about the growth of the Internet.

119
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,740
He realized that every single year
the number of people who are using the

120
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,470
Internet was increasing by 2000,

121
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,520
300 percent.

122
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,580
Even though the world wide
web had many naysayers,

123
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,230
he knew that the Internet wasn't just a
passing fad and it would become a part

124
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,640
of people's daily lives.

125
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,900
Very soon he knew early on to take
advantage of this and figured that if he

126
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:21,130
couldn't genuinely create an
online business that would
help make people's lives

127
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:21,910
easier,

128
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,840
it would last.

129
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,400
It was also was thinking about the
customer and then work from that.

130
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,410
Before Jeff Bezos met his wife,

131
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:35,921
Mckenzie,

132
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:39,250
he said that he was always looking for
a resource for women because he always

133
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,600
admired how his own parents would
work as a team in order to make their

134
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:43,960
circumstances work.

135
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,410
It needs a drug that he was looking
for someone to sort of like macgyver,

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,470
someone who was able to get him
out of a third world prison.

137
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,420
He was lucky to find out while he was
still working his job at de Shaw Mckenzie

138
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,900
Tuttle was a fellow princeton who was
applying to work for the fan since Jeff

139
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,970
Bezos was the one in charge
of hiring new candidates.

140
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,000
He sold her resume and
even before meeting her,

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,840
he knew that she was clearly a
very intelligent and capable women.

142
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,670
When she arrived for the job interview,

143
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,650
you felt cupid's Arrow strike
him right in the heart.

144
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,850
Even the office romances
are sometimes frowned upon.

145
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,170
They fell in love now,

146
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,210
even though he secretly at Mater,

147
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,410
he didn't want to cross the line,

148
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,340
so it was actually Mckinsey who made the
first move and asked him out for lunch.

149
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,310
They were dating for just three months
before they got engaged and they got

150
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,930
married in 1993.

151
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,090
When Jeff Bezos turned 30 years old,

152
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,890
they had been married for only a year.

153
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,090
He told his wife about his idea for an
online bookstore and that he wanted to

154
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,920
quit his job in order to pursue it.

155
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,800
They decided to leave
New York City in 1994.

156
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,371
Basically,

157
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,940
I just chose to start this company in
Seattle because it's also the location of

158
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,571
Microsoft,

159
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:49,910
so there was a lot of
talent in the tech industry,

160
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,721
living death,

161
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,100
and to find employees from.

162
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,540
It's also far cheaper to start a company
that compared to New York or silicon

163
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,110
valley,

164
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,930
they now have several children together
and they had built a rock solid

165
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:03,470
foundation together long before
Amazon Dotcom never existed.

166
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,200
Once the company began to do well,

167
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,660
Mackenzie was able to fulfill her
dream of becoming a published author.

168
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,081
Today,

169
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:09,914
Jeff Bezos,

170
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,150
he puts family first.

171
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,170
He says that he refuses to take any
meetings before 10:00 AM because spending

172
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:18,590
time with his family and having breakfast
with his children before they go to

173
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,560
school is more important
to him than anything else.

174
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,790
When Jeff Thins Mckenzie Bayzos first
moved down to the west coast to start

175
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,620
Amazon.com in 1994.

176
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,430
At that time,

177
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,560
the website only soldier used books
in his mind is Jeff Bezos imagined a

178
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,310
bookstore with millions of titles and he
knew that that would eventually be the

179
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:47,120
end goal of the company because the did
the accounting and he began building the

180
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:48,770
website and sourcing inventory.

181
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,491
In the beginning,

182
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,800
they ran the company out of that garage.

183
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,540
After receiving an order for a book,

184
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,960
Jeff would go to thrift stores and used
the bookshops that looking for the book

185
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:59,990
that was requested and then send it
to the customer through the mail.

186
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,950
If he could not find it,

187
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,340
he would source it from
someone else online just to
make sure that the sale went

188
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:04,910
through.

189
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,390
That way they were able to run the
company without using much physical space

190
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,060
when they were ready to hire a team to
help them run the business out of that

191
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:11,570
house,

192
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,190
the staff of Amazon.com,

193
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,480
it was only eight people.

194
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,250
Since the company did not have much money,

195
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,980
he asked his employees to
make desks out of old doors.

196
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,150
Even to this day,

197
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,740
the door desk is still a
tradition at MSN offices.

198
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,550
Before bringing the website live
onto the world wide web based,

199
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,810
they sent it to 300 of his friends so
that they could test it beforehand.

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,740
When the team was getting ready to
officially launch the site in 1995,

201
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,220
they set up the computer to Ding
every time that there was a sale.

202
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,060
In the beginning,

203
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,000
everyone would shout and share
every time there was a new sale,

204
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:44,780
but within just a few days there were so
many sales that they grew tired of the

205
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,400
noise and they had to turn it off.

206
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,660
The website was so popular they were
getting business through word of mouth

207
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,110
without paying a single
dime for press coverage.

208
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,213
Jeff's idea,

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,220
it was absolutely shocking and it was
clear to the team that the company would

210
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,210
become a success.

211
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,920
The reason why Amazon.com succeeded so
quickly was that Bayzos was filling a

212
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,080
very real need that people had.

213
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,010
It was the very first online bookstore
before even barnes and noble began

214
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,510
selling their stock on the Internet.

215
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,471
Ever since then,

216
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,640
Amazon continued to pioneer various
aspects of incorporating the internet into

217
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,080
people's daily lives and he says that
for seven years there was no competition

218
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,780
that was similar to what
he was doing in 1997 bays.

219
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,810
I just wanted to take Amazon.com public.

220
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,510
Thankfully he still had
connections on Wall Street,

221
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:33,900
so we knew exactly how to approach
investors with a business plan.

222
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,110
They fully admitted that he did not
actually intend to make any profit for the

223
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,330
first five years that the
company was operating,

224
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,870
Jeff Bezos gave stock options to
all of his original employees,

225
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,750
and this made them very motivated
to make the company succeed.

226
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,860
After a couple of years,

227
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:50,910
every single one of those eight
employees had become multimillionaires.

228
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,810
After awhile,

229
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,570
bases wanted to sell for
more than just books,

230
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,200
female to thousand random customers
asking what sorts of items they would like

231
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,130
to buy on the Internet.

232
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,791
Soon enough,

233
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,960
he was getting replies.

234
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:03,540
If ice comes in just about every category,

235
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,950
he realized that he wanted to grow Amazon
into a store that sold everything and

236
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,920
he began using the same
method that he had with books,

237
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,270
listing a product online,

238
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,680
buying the item in person,

239
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,300
and then shipping it to the customer.

240
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:15,961
Of course,

241
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:17,820
this only helped the
company grow even more,

242
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,040
but even after earning
millions of dollars,

243
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,920
Bayzos continued to drive
his beat up old Honda.

244
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,390
He wanted to show his employees that
he still stood by his core values of

245
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,310
frugality and resourcefulness.

246
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,290
Instead of spending that money on himself,

247
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,290
he reinvested the money
to make Amazon.com better.

248
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,250
They bought out other competing online
book region is and brought them into the

249
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:38,880
fold.

250
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,840
He also designed it to give anyone in
the United States the opportunity to sell

251
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,450
on the Amazon platform
as third party sellers,

252
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,440
which one made the platform stronger
because it expanded their adventury.

253
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,570
Every decision Jeff Bezos made for the
expanding business was with the future in

254
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,140
mind.

255
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,370
When he learned about Ebooks,

256
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,850
he gave the people the opportunity to
self publish their work online for the

257
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,590
first time and Zen and income.

258
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,191
Next,

259
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:05,910
he develops the kindle ereader to give
people a place to read all of their

260
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:06,430
ebooks.

261
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,970
When you saw on digital streaming
services becoming popular,

262
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,240
he jumped on that bandwagon as well
and the list of things like this,

263
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,190
it just goes on and on.

264
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:14,791
Today.

265
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,270
Amazon.com is one of the most massive
corporations in the world and they have

266
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,260
dipped their toes into so many different
industries at this point that it's kind

267
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,400
of hard to keep track.

268
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,690
Amazon has been criticized for putting
independent bookstores out of business.

269
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:31,800
Even major corporations like borders
books simply could not compete.

270
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,390
According to Amazon Dot Com.

271
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,130
Former manager Mike Daisy.

272
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,850
Amazon is designed from the
ground up to be a shock.

273
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,350
It's designed to dissolve and destroy
other businesses by undercutting them.

274
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:43,951
However,

275
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:47,970
Jeff Bezos argues that he should not be
blamed for the downfall of these other

276
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:51,070
businesses because the future
was coming no matter what,

277
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,590
whether it was him or someone else.

278
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,830
Jeff Bezos says that whenever he
makes a major business decision,

279
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:01,210
he imagines himself at 80 years old and
if he would be proud of his actions,

280
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,193
looking back,

281
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,610
if the answer is yes,

282
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,520
he listens to that intuition
and he goes for it.

283
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,170
By listening to his heart,

284
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,490
he has become one of the most
successful people in the world.

285
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,400
Amazon has been incredibly
successful into lots of people.

286
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:23,690
Attributed it to Jeff Bezos,

287
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:24,890
has skills in leadership.

288
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,280
He has a list of core
values for Amazon and see,

289
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,130
always abides by those rules himself.

290
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,750
At the end of the DOTCOM bubble,

291
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:37,751
the value of Amazon stock went from $113
per share all the way down to $6 per

292
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:39,560
share.

293
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,090
For many members of the original team,

294
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,790
they lost millions of dollars
in their stock portfolio,

295
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,930
and this was enough to destroy the
vast majority of those early Internet

296
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:48,740
businesses.

297
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,940
One of the many reasons why
Amazon survived was that
Jeff Bezos wasn't judging

298
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,190
the business's success on the stock price.

299
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,080
He knew that people were still using the
website and it was growing every single

300
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:00,620
day,

301
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,760
as we mentioned before.

302
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:02,050
Basically,

303
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,670
it's always made his customers
the number one priority.

304
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,040
Whenever you received a
very serious complaint,

305
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,120
he would never try to reprimand
his employees for making a mistake.

306
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,750
Instead,

307
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,740
he would forward a particularly troubling
customer complaints to the manager of

308
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,800
each department with a simple
question mark and the subject line.

309
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,580
According to former employees getting
one of those question mark emails was

310
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:26,150
terrifying and they would quickly do
everything they could to fix the problem

311
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:26,984
immediately.

312
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,820
When the issues were resolved,

313
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,500
bezos would simply reply with a smiley
face if he sees a bad experience that a

314
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:34,251
customer has.

315
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:39,251
He uses it as a case study to improve
the company overall and not just that one

316
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:41,720
person's individual experience.

317
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,480
Amazon is now available in 16 countries,

318
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:48,380
so he has had to give up much of the
power over those branches of the companies

319
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,240
and see you can't be everywhere at once.

320
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,740
Some countries are actually trying to
fend off Amazon's monopoly in certain

321
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,430
industries.

322
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,881
In France,

323
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:56,391
for example,

324
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,830
there is a law that no bookstore,

325
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,600
whether it be online or in person,

326
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,710
is allowed to discount a book by more
than five percent off the retail price and

327
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:06,470
they can ask you a free
shipping to entice buyers.

328
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:06,921
This way,

329
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,920
independent bookshops in
France still thriving.

330
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,390
Only time is going to tell how many
nations are going to adopt Amazon in the

331
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:15,224
future.

332
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,880
By a stroke of genius,

333
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:27,881
Jeff Bezos has managed to run Amazon.com
with this or to no profit despite the

334
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:32,090
fact that they are bringing in billions
of dollars in revenue every single year.

335
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,560
This is because he's always thinking
about the future and trying to grow the

336
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:40,580
business to keep pushing the envelope
and what is going to happen next.

337
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,950
Basically is still a
true trekkie at heart,

338
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:46,730
so it's really no surprise that he is
creating a private space company called

339
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,593
blue origin.

340
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,780
Just like you said during his
high school graduation speech.

341
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:55,700
He believes that someday it will be
very normal for people to be living and

342
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,710
working in space and he wants to be on
the forefront of that few shot at the

343
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,180
time that we're making this video.

344
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:07,181
Jeff Bezos is worth a hundred and 37 point
$6,000,000,000 and that makes him the

345
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,430
wealthiest man in all of history.

346
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,503
Amazon.com.

347
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,080
It's been valued at over a trillion
dollars and of course there is always the

348
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,060
chance that this wealth will grow,

349
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,090
but he hasn't just hoarding
well if this money to himself,

350
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,560
he created the Bezos family foundation
and also the world what charitable cause

351
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,520
he could help pay for.

352
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,380
He received 47,000 emails with suggestions
about where the money should go and

353
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:34,520
he spends a lot of time reading some of
the best ideas for courses that truly

354
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,210
matter.

355
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,050
He said all of the best
decisions are made with instinct,

356
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,183
intuition.

357
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,233
It's hot.

358
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,170
Jeff Bezos says that he wants to give
his money away to many of these charities

359
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:48,680
and invest more in startup business
ideas that will help humanity.

360
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,820
He decided to begin this journey by
opening tuition free Montessori preschools

361
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,480
and underprivileged communities so that
children can have the same opportunities

362
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,140
that he did,

363
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,070
and he also wants to open
homeless shelters that allow
an entire family to stay

364
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,620
together instead of splitting
men and women apart.

365
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,850
As time goes on,

366
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,851
we'll see just how much Jeff Bezos uses
his money for good and he's always open

367
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,120
to suggestions,

368
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,370
so I really hope you found
that video interesting.

369
