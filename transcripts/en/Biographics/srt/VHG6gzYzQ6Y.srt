1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,520
He was a force of nature,

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,210
the quintessential Aussie outdoorsman
with this wicked sense of humor and his

3
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,040
insatiable passion for wildlife.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,940
Steve Irwin,

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,900
the crocodile hunter,

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,850
became a worldwide celebrity.

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,440
He shone a spotlight on man's
mismanagement of our natural resources and

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,191
champions.

9
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,800
The plays of the planet's
most vulnerable inhabitants,

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,753
the animals,

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,470
but Steve was also a dare devil,

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,740
constantly pushing the limits in
his interactions with the wiles.

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,270
Then in a tragic moments,

14
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,050
he was gone,

15
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,760
taken from us far too soon.

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,050
In today's biographics,

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,930
we get to grips with the
crocodile hunter from down under

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,840
Steven Robertson.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,300
When was born on February
the 22nd 1962 in Melbourne,

20
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:54,134
Australia.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,190
Both of his parents were passionate about
wildlife is father Bob was a plumber,

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,970
but he was also a keen hepatologist who
studied amphibians while his mother Lynn

23
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:03,400
was a wildlife rehabilitator.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,850
When Steve was just a few years old,

25
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:08,690
the family moved to Queensland's where
Bob and Lynn opens the Queensland Reptile

26
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:09,524
and Foreigner Park.

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,800
Steve therefore grew up around his reps
and was and we're soon put to work at

28
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:13,430
the park.

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,520
He would clean out the cages and
feed the crocodiles and the lizards.

30
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,600
By the age of six,

31
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:20,540
he was accustomed to being around
creatures that most children would be

32
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,374
terrified of.

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,450
His whole existence was surrounded by
wildlife from crocodiles to Kangaroos to

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,020
wireless.

35
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,000
The Iowans develops their
reptile park from nothing.

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,150
They spend the first couple
of years living in a caravan
while they slowly added

37
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,470
to that animal inventory.

38
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,980
The first snakes they put on display where
ones the Bob and Steve captured while

39
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:37,610
out fishing.

40
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,980
Meanwhile then was busy
rehabilitating orphans,

41
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:40,880
Joey's Kangaroos,

42
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:41,331
Koalas,

43
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:41,691
wombats,

44
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,051
snakes,

45
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:42,884
and craze.

46
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,790
At the same time,

47
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,450
she was raising three children of her
own Steve proof to be a mischievous child

48
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:49,700
who was always testing the
patients of his father.

49
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,410
He would constantly go missing,

50
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,740
only to be discovered down at the
local creek or chasing visits.

51
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,480
Yet he wasn't being rebellious.

52
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,470
He wanted to find venomous snakes and
lizards so the team could show them to his

53
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,240
dad and to win his approval,

54
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,680
but rather than making him proud,

55
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,390
Steve's constant wanderings left.

56
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,710
Bob Frustrated there.

57
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:07,970
Boy was hyperactive.

58
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,830
He never sat still from the age of two.

59
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:12,110
He developed a skill and
to love for climbing trees.

60
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,290
So the first thing that his family
members would do when he went missing was

61
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,000
look up on the way to school.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,040
If he saw a dead reptile
lying on the road,

63
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,550
Steve would make his mother stylists so
that he could get out and investigate.

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,690
When he was six years old,

65
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,010
he got the best present.

66
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,130
He could have wished for
a 12 foot long python.

67
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,120
Steve Absolutely adored his
new best friend at school.

68
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,580
Steve was considered a bit
of an oddity by his peers.

69
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,970
He wasn't into the normal boy things
like bicycle sports and skateboards.

70
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,030
He spends his lunchtimes wandering
around the school yards and looking for

71
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:41,481
birds,

72
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,051
lizards,

73
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:43,880
and any other creatures
that he could find.

74
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,900
After a while,

75
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,220
other kids got involved looking to
Steve as the local experts on all things

76
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:50,360
related to wildlife.

77
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,820
Baba when was a hero
and a mentor to his son.

78
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,470
He was a wildlife innovator who was at
the cutting edge of animal husbandry with

79
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:01,180
the wildlife park established the good
supply of smaller reptiles and animals.

80
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,960
What would the sizes?

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,270
It was time to add a couple of crocodiles.

82
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,440
It took nine year old Steve with him on
his first crocodile humps as expected,

83
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,310
the boy was extremely active and it was
all his dad could do to keep them in the

84
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:12,910
boat.

85
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,960
When a crock was cited,

86
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,030
Steve would want to be
the first one to grab it.

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,750
He was positioned at the front of the
boat with a spotlight while his father was

88
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,350
operating the outboard motor.

89
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,330
As they got close,

90
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Steve fixed desires and what
he thought was a small CROC.

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,770
Then he bounced out of the boat and it's
got into the water grabbing us by the

92
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,160
neck,

93
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,860
but the boy he didn't realize
how launched this crocodile was.

94
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,170
It was in fact about the same size as him,

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,370
quite a bit stronger.

96
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,030
When it became clear to Bob that his son
was getting the worst of the encounter,

97
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,870
he reached his arm into the water and
scoops up both of them scooping the boy

98
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,111
hams,

99
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,680
the Croc into the boat and pinning the
animal down with his body recovering

100
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,040
quickly.

101
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,210
Steve took over the job of holding down
the crock with a huge smile on his face.

102
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,330
It was one of the proudest
moments of his life so far.

103
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,090
In the early seventies reports
of crocodiles attacking
people were becoming more

104
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:10,800
and more frequent around Australia.

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,620
As the stock of crocodiles
at the reptile park grew,

106
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Bob decided to involve himself in
attempts to resolve the conflicts between

107
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:18,990
crocodiles and humans.

108
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,220
He joins the East Coast Crocodile and
management program and he and Steve threw

109
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,390
themselves into the task of capturing
and relocating crocs from areas where

110
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,850
there was potential for an
osteon counter with humans.

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,310
It was extremely dangerous work,

112
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,050
but it was exciting and young.

113
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,080
Steve Excels is this,

114
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,950
here's a natural gift for
not only locating the crocs,

115
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,420
but also for capturing them.

116
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,860
He would get absolutely
focused on catching a crocodile
as if you were entering

117
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,540
into one on one combat with us.

118
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,180
Once the CROC was secured
and subdued in his nest,

119
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,950
he would get a huge adrenaline rush,

120
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,960
which would make him keen
for the next encounter,

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,610
but at the time he was in his late teens.

122
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,550
Steve was living in the Bush
for extended periods of time,

123
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,840
camping out under the stars and spending
days at a time in pursuit of a single

124
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:01,420
KROC.

125
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,660
He had to live off the land and the water,

126
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,630
honing his Bush skills while developing
the mystique of the crocodile hunter.

127
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,830
It was grueling work and most of
the time Steve was on his own.

128
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,610
He was young,

129
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,443
he was fit.

130
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,130
He was keen and he was innovative.

131
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,000
Steve became the most successful crocodile
hunter in the land with his grand

132
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:18,720
reputation,

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,980
came a degree of complacency.

134
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:22,140
Though he begins to feel
that he could do anything.

135
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,011
On one occasion,

136
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,270
he got a crock back to his camp,

137
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,470
ready to put it in a crate,

138
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,960
but he neglected to
secure the animal's mouth,

139
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,010
not realizing this.

140
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,980
Steve let the Croc out of its
nest as he prepared the Christ.

141
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,470
Then with his back turned
the crock attacked,

142
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,890
snapping.

143
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,660
It's huge jaws around his neck.

144
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,620
Fortunately,

145
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,220
Steve Gone out of this situation with
nothing but a few holes in his boot.

146
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,180
On another occasion,

147
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,930
Bob Winds up into northern Queensland
in search of an infamous crock known as

148
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,764
agro.

149
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,700
This creature would pop.

150
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,920
Its head is out of the water
right next to the boats.

151
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,120
Horrifying the locals.

152
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,080
Bob's goal was to locate the beast and
set up a marker so that his son could

153
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,940
follow up and execute the capture.

154
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,920
Bob located the CROC easily and has
made a mark and then overhanging tree so

155
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,960
that Steve would know
where to set the trap.

156
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,441
Yes.

157
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,760
From the moments that he went in,

158
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,420
Steve could feel that agro was stalking
him as he was setting the trap or

159
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,420
something bumped into his boat
and his dog again barking.

160
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,760
Steve quickly set the trap and then left.

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,820
Now he was simply a matter
of watching and waiting.

162
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,960
On the third day,

163
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,140
Steve headed for the site.

164
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,160
You need to discover that the trap
was completely submerged under water.

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,590
The base had been taken
and the trap and gone off.

166
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,580
Steve brought his boat close and grabbed
a hold of the net's ready to drag the

167
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,990
capture of crock on deck.

168
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,890
Suddenly there was a massive upheaval
as the crocs smashed into the boat from

169
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,724
under the water.

170
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,371
A stun.

171
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,460
Steve managed to maintain
his grip on the nest,

172
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,580
but then another blow rock
to the boat and then another,

173
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,300
but Steve,

174
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,320
he held on Mandy.

175
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,970
He began dragging the net in.

176
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,750
Finally,

177
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,550
he managed to get the tail on board,

178
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,570
but then the entire body of the CROC
catapulted out of the water and into the

179
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,381
air coming down.

180
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,880
Besides Steve in the boat,

181
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,820
the man and his doc immediately
jumped into the water.

182
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,670
Steve now grabbed what
every good bronch's ropes,

183
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:02,000
mud and threw it on top of the
violently thrashing crocodile.

184
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,430
The ideal thing here would have
been to blindfold the animal,

185
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,450
but that was out of the question.

186
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,720
Steve then jumps into the boat and
onto the back of the crocodile.

187
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,620
He threw more nursing over the beast
trying to cover its eyes and then he finds

188
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,270
up the outboard motor and started for
sure all the way back the crocodile faults

189
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:20,570
so violently that Steve was convinced
the boat was going to split a pass.

190
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,040
Steve finally goes to the
one ton crocodile secured
and restraints back at his

191
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,970
camp is next.

192
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,380
Problem was how to move it.

193
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,440
It decided to go back to a local
farm and recruit some helpers,

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,000
but when the cane farmers
saw the size of angry,

195
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,760
they refuse to get out of their boat.

196
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,510
Steve had to resort to getting a
front end loader to shift the CROC.

197
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,410
It was experiences like this that
Tan Steve into a local legends,

198
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,700
but Steve had mixed feelings.

199
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,880
He felt bad to the DNC,

200
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,700
remove agro from his natural environment.

201
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,863
It's

202
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,550
by 1990 Steve had recaptured
more than a hundred crocs.

203
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,970
Some of them were kept at the reptile
park while the majority were released into

204
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:04,780
the wild.

205
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,680
In 1991 Bob and Lynn decided that Steve
had come of age and was ready to take

206
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,880
control of the park.

207
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,960
Steve's goal was to make his parents
proud and he knew he would do this by

208
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:14,741
turning the park,

209
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:19,030
and so one of the greatest
wildlife facilities on the
face of the earth is first

210
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,310
step was to rename the park Australia Zoo.

211
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,970
He then threw himself into creating
the most exciting educational and

212
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,870
entertaining wildlife experience that
zoo visitors would ever experience.

213
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,350
The highlights would be the crocodile
show where Steve would be right up close

214
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:36,100
and personal with crocs totally
in control and showing no fear.

215
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,640
He would tell the crowds what passionate
and loving animals they work with is

216
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:40,720
huge personality,

217
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,920
boundless energy.

218
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,120
He quickly one over the public and
attendance figures went through the roof

219
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,890
in 1991 among the tens of thousands of
visitors to Australia Zoo was Terry rain.

220
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,750
It's a veterinarian and animal
lover from the United States.

221
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,590
She was looking for a place to relocate
cougars that had been used in the

222
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,580
entertainment industry.

223
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,630
She was drawn to their
crocodile demonstration and
the fast talking Aussie who

224
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,310
was in there with the deadly creatures,

225
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,120
Terri,

226
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,520
she wrote down her immediate
impressions of Steve.

227
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,890
I thought there was no one like
this anywhere in the world.

228
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,230
He sounded like an environmental Tarzan,

229
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,630
a larger than life superhero guy.

230
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,800
Steve managed to catch sight of Terry
and the crowd and according to him it was

231
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,820
love at first sight.

232
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,570
The two kindred spirits were engaged
for months after their first encounter.

233
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,740
They married in Eugene,

234
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,340
Oregon,

235
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,780
Terry's hometown on June the fourth
1992 the honeymoon was spent hunting.

236
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:43,410
Crocodiles in northern Queensland does
say that Terry was out of our elements on

237
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:45,090
this trip would be an understatement.

238
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,200
She had never been into the Hash Australia
and Alice and she definitely hadn't

239
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,730
been on a crocodile hunter before,

240
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,450
but trusting implicitly in the man
that she referred to as her prince,

241
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,550
she threw herself into the experience,

242
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,240
the company,

243
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,060
the winds on their honeymoon
adventure with Steve's friends,

244
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,050
John Stainton,

245
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,070
stains in films,

246
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:05,580
the action of the CROC hands and other
adventures including Terry's first

247
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:08,100
encounter with a six
foot long black snake.

248
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,090
This footage became the first episode of
a new animal planet TV show called the

249
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,020
crocodile hunter.

250
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,310
The series which featured both Steve and
Terry was so successful that a second

251
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,020
and then a third series were ordered.

252
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,140
It was a hit in over 130 countries with
hundreds of millions of people embracing

253
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,640
Steve's lovable and over the top.

254
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,340
Aussie personality is
trademark catch phrase,

255
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,920
cranky became known the world over.

256
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,120
Crikey Kreigan the final
episodes of series three.

257
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,280
We're entitled at Steve's last adventure.

258
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,970
It followed him across the world as he
embarked upon adventures everywhere from

259
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,040
the Himalayas to South Africa and China.

260
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,270
The Crocodile Hunter series allowed
Steve to take his conservation message to

261
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:48,930
the world.

262
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,950
He viewed it as his life's mission to
work tirelessly to save the world's

263
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:54,150
endangered species.

264
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,920
As a result of his name recognition,

265
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,790
he became the front man for a number
of media campaigns and became the

266
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,370
passionate ambassador for
Australia and tourism,

267
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,920
Steve Crusaded for wildlife preservation,

268
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,300
using his fame to bring the issue to the
public consciousness in the late 1990s

269
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,110
he also discovered a new species of sea
turtle and was at the forefront if a

270
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,760
campaign against animal poaching.

271
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,830
He also funds in large nature reserves,

272
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,930
not just in Australia but also in Fiji.

273
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,700
Vanuatu and the United States.

274
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,390
Irwin's TV series fame led some more
television and even some movie work.

275
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,410
He appears in 2000 and
one's doctor Doolittle to as
himself and then started in

276
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:32,370
the crocodile hunter collision course the
following year in 2006 he provided the

277
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:35,820
voice for an elephant seal named
Trev in the movie happy feet.

278
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,510
The money that Steve made from his TV
and movie appearances was poured into

279
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:43,560
building new exhibits for Australia Zoo
and for funding conservation projects.

280
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,280
The zoo was designed as an animal park
with the comfort of the animals being the

281
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,360
foremost concern.

282
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,050
Fences and cages would only be
used when absolutely necessary.

283
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,410
The staff at the zoo grew to about 50
and the area grew to take up about a

284
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,570
hundred acres.

285
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:56,810
This year.

286
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,810
He won the award for Best
Australian tourist attraction
in 2003 to 2004 and 2004

287
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:06,120
the Australian animal hospital was opened
right next to the zoo hospital cancer

288
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:09,880
for around 6,000 animals
each year in 2006 Australia.

289
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:10,714
As you retail,

290
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,490
one of the Australian tourism retailing,

291
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,050
Steven Terry had two children together.

292
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:30,051
I've been de born in 1998 and Robert in
2003 Bindeez birth was filmed and shown

293
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:32,000
on TV for the crocodile hunter series.

294
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,270
Steve had been filming for the show when
he got the call that Terry's waters had

295
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:35,930
broken.

296
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,920
He turns up at the hospital two hours
later with a complete film group in tow.

297
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,380
Terry was surprised about sounds.

298
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,110
What was her nature?

299
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,400
She took it all in their stride.

300
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,220
They were both delighted when they
found out they had a baby girl.

301
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,470
Steve knew instantly what
the name was going to be.

302
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,890
Windy sue after his favorite
CROC and his favorite dog,

303
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,250
Steve was the self proclaimed proudest
father on the face of the earth.

304
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,580
He hadn't been de bonded instantly
becoming virtually inseparable.

305
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,800
She winds on to her first
wildlife documentary,

306
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,120
shoot it just six days old.

307
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,780
Then the would grow up in
the international spotlight
starring in our own show

308
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:07,970
Bindi jungle girl when
she was eight years old.

309
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,850
Although the series adds the
year after Steve's passing,

310
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,090
it was shot before he died and so
he featured in several episodes.

311
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,820
November of 2003 found Steve Filming
a documentary off the coast of Baja,

312
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:33,230
California Peninsula in Mexico about sea
lions or report came through the boat's

313
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,840
radio that a pair of scuba
divers were missing in the area.

314
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,750
Steve immediately shut down
filming and join the search.

315
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,290
The next state members of his crew found
one of the divers thinking to a rocky

316
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,770
cliff edge Stevens and other rescuer
broad the man back to their boat.

317
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,480
The other man's body was located a short
time after in early 2004 Steve made the

318
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:54,290
news for the wrong reasons when video was
shown of him feeding a Checkin Caucus,

319
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,270
do a 12 and a half.

320
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:59,660
It's salt water crocodile while holding
his one month old infant son Charles

321
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,250
Welfare and animal
rights groups are like a,

322
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:04,190
condemns the action with some
referring to it as child abuse,

323
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,850
but if Steven Terry contended that he
had full control over the situation,

324
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,710
nevertheless Steve did apologize.

325
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,330
Doing so on the American channel,

326
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:11,990
NBC,

327
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,620
the incidents prompted the Queensland's
government's to enact a law stating that

328
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,970
no one trains persons or children were
allowed inside a crocodile enclosure.

329
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,520
Steve was also criticized
for his conservation views,

330
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,330
which some viewed as overly simplistic
and weighted towards tourism.

331
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,170
The Sydney Morning Herald wrote to that
his message boil down to eating reason.

332
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:34,580
Crocs is bad for tourism and therefore
more cruel than eating other animals.

333
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,031
There were,

334
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:39,350
however other industry experts who poured
preys upon oh and and the work that he

335
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:42,410
had done to raise the public's
awareness of conservation issues.

336
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,221
Mark towns ends,

337
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:47,150
the CEO of Queensland's RSBC
called him a modern day Noah,

338
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,270
while the Canadian environmentalist
remarks after Steve's passing,

339
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,800
that humanity will not protect that
which we fear or do not understand.

340
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,370
Steva when helps us understand those
things that many people thought were a

341
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:01,130
nuisance at best or at worst,

342
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,690
that's made him a great educator.

343
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,090
And it's conservationist Steve's zone,

344
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,120
conservation mentor,

345
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,450
what was British conservationist
and a film maker.

346
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,840
So David Attenborough and month after
Steve's death Terrio when presented

347
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:15,200
Attenborough with a lifetime achievement
award and his acceptance speech.

348
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,730
So David praised Steve saying that he
taught people how wonderful and exciting

349
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,593
nature was.

350
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,350
And he was a born communicator

351
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,170
throughout is 44 years.

352
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,460
Steve had taken on and defeated many
of the most dangerous creatures on the

353
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,030
planet.

354
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,530
It was ironic then that the animal that
would get the better of him was saying

355
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,860
normally tranquil fish.

356
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,200
On September the fourth 2006 he was
filming off Australia's Great Barrier Reef

357
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,820
for a documentary to be
called oceans deadliest.

358
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,680
The weather had been bad for several days,

359
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,800
so Steve had been sitting around with
little to do but wait for the weather to

360
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:56,820
improve that day.

361
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:59,310
He decided to do some snorkeling
in the shallow waters,

362
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,000
which could be films for his daughter
Bindeez New TV show you've got down into

363
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:03,480
the water,

364
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,680
which was only at chest height.

365
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,810
Seeing a large blue bull sting ray,

366
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,880
he came over the top of
it in order to film it.

367
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:09,720
As it swam away,

368
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,400
just as he hovered above it,

369
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,500
the sting ray thrust up its tail
and it's began starting upwards.

370
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,550
A Barb was shot directly
and to Steve's chest,

371
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,300
immediately pulled it out and rose to the
top and struggled to get back into the

372
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:21,840
boat.

373
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,290
The crew administered CPR and then rushed
him to the nearest hospital that he

374
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,800
was announced dead on arrival.

375
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,830
Steve's legacy lives on through his wife,

376
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:30,930
Terry and just children Bindi and Robert.

377
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,370
These three wildlife warriors continue
to run Australia Zoo and to honor the

378
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,890
memory of this truly amazing man.

379
