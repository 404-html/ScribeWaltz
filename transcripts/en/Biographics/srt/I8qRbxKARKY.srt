1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,200
He's the man who kills a king.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:02,831
All of a chrome,

3
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:03,041
well,

4
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:04,300
the English puritan sounds,

5
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:08,260
military dictator is today most famous
for signing the death warrants that led

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,240
to Charles the first bloody execution
in 1649 over a hundred years before the

7
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:15,580
American and French
revolutions shook the globe.

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,110
This small time British farmer from
the British sticks proved with steel,

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,620
the divine right of kings
was not so holy after all.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,990
What possessed a guy who
worked in agriculture to
drop his tools one day and go

11
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:29,050
and commit regicide?

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,130
The story is even more fascinating
than you probably think from his humble

13
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:33,641
backgrounds.

14
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:38,260
Cranwell would rise to become a leading
puritan and tireless advocate of

15
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:41,920
religious freedom even as you committed
war crimes on the battlefields of

16
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:46,570
islands and pursued personal
empowerment with a terrifying zeal.

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,820
And I'd also some I go to others.

18
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,560
This is the true story of the man
who spearheaded England's civil war.

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,720
Like many great amount of history,

20
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:08,231
I'll have a crumb.

21
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:11,350
Well was born into surprisingly
modest circumstances,

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,910
well modest for the 90 classes of
Britain who in the dying days of the 16th

23
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,700
century were the only
ones who really mattered.

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,140
The second of 10 children.

25
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:24,160
Young Oliver was the product
of a Protestant family
that has done well out of

26
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:26,290
the reformation seven decades earlier,

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,500
rising from brewers do
owners of a smaller state.

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,900
He could trace a family
link back to Henry.

29
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:32,870
The eighth adviser,

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,670
Thomas Cromwellian and his
nearby grandfather frequently
entertains James the

31
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,170
first rail hunting party.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,360
Young old liver may not have been rich,

33
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,250
but he was certainly well connected.

34
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,480
He was also growing up in the shadow
of Britain's most notorious terrorist

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,830
attack in 1605 vengeful Catholics had
gunpowder beneath the House of Lords

36
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,090
intending to blow up the king.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,440
The pilot's discovery fired off a wave
of anti-catholic fervor across England.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,760
Something this may well have helps form
young Oliver's strict Protestant outlook

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,390
terrorism side,

40
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,940
though the reign of James the first
was mostly stable and all of the lives,

41
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,330
a mostly stable life.

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,320
You attended school,

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,910
spent a year at Cambridge University.

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,780
They need to be forced to return
to the family's east Anglia estate.

45
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,790
After his father died in 1620 he married
Elizabeth [inaudible] and does that

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,600
really should have been that.

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,410
However,

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,410
in 1625 something happens that would
act as a catalyst for all the bloodshed

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,980
there was about to follow.

50
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,650
On March the 27th James the first died,

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,290
his son Charles the first
inherited the throne.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,800
It was the start of a long
march towards catastrophe.

53
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,760
Charles the first was by most accounts
they're shy and draw the sweet fellow in

54
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,320
private in public.

55
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,370
He was everything that growing pirouettes
and movements in England feared his

56
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:46,600
wife was a catholic.

57
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,860
He supported a form of Anglicanism that
appear dangerously close to Catholicism.

58
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,401
Oh.

59
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,850
And he was super keen on raising
taxes to send his friend,

60
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:59,560
Lord Bucking and gala van zing off to
fight foreign wars that England did not a

61
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,670
chance of winning.

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,560
When the new king convened his first
Parliament in 1625 it became known as the

63
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,820
useless parliaments because its members
refuse to vote through those new taxes

64
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,720
that Charles wanted.

65
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,380
And I Charles dissolve the
parliaments after just 12 days.

66
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,330
One yet later he tried again only for the
mps do also refuse to raise taxes that

67
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,930
would be wasted on Buckingham's
boneheaded back narrowing.

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,801
So once again,

69
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,080
Charles dissolved
parliament and by the way,

70
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,840
get ready to hear that sentence a lot.

71
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,590
Well,

72
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,860
London was indulging in high
politics back in east Anglia.

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,381
I'll ever chrome.

74
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:33,611
Well,

75
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,610
it was in the grip of eight
severe spiritual illness,

76
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,780
plagued for years,

77
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,070
like serious depression.

78
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,060
He finally slipped into a funk one night
that became a fever and that nearly

79
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,160
became death when he finally recovered.

80
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,600
He was a changed man.

81
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Cromwells would later describe
as experiences emerging
from darkness into light,

82
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,100
the light of puritanism.

83
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,880
From then on,

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,030
he would be a staunch
defender of the puritan faith.

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,340
The road to Damascus style conversion.

86
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,500
Me explain what happened next.

87
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,450
In 1628 Charles the first decided once
again to try raising taxes and cold.

88
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,201
Yes,

89
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,100
another parliaments.

90
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,690
This time Cranwell decided to join using
those connections that we talked about

91
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:13,780
earlier.

92
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,070
He managed to literally get himself a
front row seats to the most explosive

93
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,870
parliaments in decades.

94
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,640
By 1628 Charles had resulted to extracting
money from his subjects of sorta

95
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,980
points known as forced loans.

96
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,140
They were as unpopular as daylight.

97
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,340
Robbery tends to be,

98
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,650
and it became even more
so when bucking him,

99
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,980
use the money and not just for
disastrous adventures in Spain,

100
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,981
but also to launch an
identically disastrous war
with France that Charles had

101
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,020
resulted due locking up
mps who refuse to pay,

102
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,120
only added fuel to the dumps.

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,750
Defy.

104
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,520
That was now the new parliament.

105
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,630
As a young chrome,

106
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:50,321
well looked on,

107
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:54,580
Charles refused to accept
the new parliament succession
of the rights to refuse

108
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,900
unwarranted taxation.

109
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,750
Parliament blamed Buckingham
for influencing the king.

110
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:58,910
I mean,

111
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,460
if a young army officer
to then assassinate Nord
boneheads Jarls blamed nps for

112
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,830
the death of his friends
and you guessed it,

113
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,210
he does all phenomenons.

114
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,910
He did this in something of
a fit of Pique and that peak,

115
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,744
by the way,

116
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,520
lost it for 11 years.

117
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,640
No parliament would sit from March of
1629 to April of 1640 this barrier became

118
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,990
known as the years of
personal rule for chrome.

119
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,231
Well,

120
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,730
personal rule was tough.

121
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,530
Sean of his parliamentary standing,

122
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:29,110
he wound up losing contact
with his old network,

123
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:33,070
selling his property and taking on a
small farm in Cambridgeshire to survive.

124
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,880
By 1636 crumb was a broke unimportant.

125
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,881
Nobody with zero prospects even considered
emigrating to America and joining in

126
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:42,790
with a pilgrims.

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,740
Thankfully the 16 fatties closed with do
bits of good luck for Cranwell first in

128
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,230
1636 is fabulously wealthy.

129
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:53,530
Childless uncle died and
left Oliver everything.

130
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,610
Seconds in 1639 Charles the
fest at something Spec stupid.

131
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,940
He tried to force his religious
beliefs on Scotland and downtime.

132
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,890
Scotland had been in union with England
and Wales for less than 40 years.

133
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,240
Scott's still worshiped presbytarian
style with none of the fancy stuff.

134
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,710
So beloved of Charles.

135
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,520
When Charles tried to ram his
religious reforms through the Scots,

136
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,780
they went nuts,

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,650
known as the bishops was
the following battle,

138
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,300
saw Scotland invade and
occupying northern England.

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,360
Charles sued for peace and
the Scott said essentially,

140
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,010
sure on two conditions.

141
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,490
One,

142
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,440
no more of this fancy religious Bollix
and to pay us all of our war expenses.

143
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,190
So you're completely broke with an
occupying army in the nation's north.

144
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,700
Charles was forced to grit his teeth
and summon another parliaments.

145
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,820
This attempt would go even
worse than all of his others.

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,700
The parliaments of 1640 got off to
a farcical stars known as the short

147
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:55,061
parliament.

148
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:55,451
This time,

149
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:57,460
it lasted only three weeks before.

150
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,540
Oh yes.

151
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,220
Charles dissolved parliament,

152
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,450
but there was still broke.

153
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:02,011
So he called for you.

154
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,000
I said another parliament
just six months later.

155
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,710
And finally we reached the end of our
run of Charles dissolving things because

156
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:13,711
the second vitamins of 1640 isn't known
physically as the long parliament.

157
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,220
Although the long parliament wasn't a
straight revival of the 1628 parliament,

158
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,410
it did feature some familiar faces.

159
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,080
Among them was Oliver Cromwell.

160
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,820
Now with influential puritan
with new connections,

161
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:29,260
Crum well became MP for Cambridge
during the 11 years of personal rule,

162
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:32,320
had lost his shyness in the first
week of the long parliaments.

163
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:36,530
He made an impassioned speech attacking
the king's imprisonments of freeborn

164
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,210
John.

165
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,960
In the seconds he launched a ferocious
broadside at Charles is his attempts to

166
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,480
force his brand of
Christianity upon his people.

167
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,800
While the speeches were hardly Mencken
or church or they were passionate enough,

168
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,600
that crumb well began to get noticed while
an ax putting some of Charles's taxes

169
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:55,150
on a legal footing kept to
the king's somewhat happy.

170
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,830
Parliaments also passed bills accusing
his advisors of treason and making it

171
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,520
illegal for Charles to dissolve
parliaments without their consent.

172
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,031
Oh,

173
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:07,480
and they also attacked his Catholic
wife because that's just how things are.

174
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,730
How they went down in 17th century person.

175
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,060
By 1641 things had completely deteriorated
as if a war had erupted in Ireland's

176
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,980
a royalist coup had been
crushed in Scotland.

177
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,880
Then parliament wins and presented
Charles with something called the grands.

178
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:22,780
Remonstrance.

179
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,020
This was basically a top 10 list with
the title of the reasons we hate you.

180
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,610
You stupid tyrants,

181
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,200
never imagine to take criticism.

182
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:29,531
Well,

183
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:33,310
Charles became convinced that this
was all a puritan plot against him.

184
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,290
On January the fourth 1642 Charles led
a group of soldiers into the House of

185
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,540
Commons to arrest five prominent mps.

186
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,050
I mean,

187
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,300
it's unprecedented in English history,

188
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,343
but the Mvs,

189
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,920
they weren't there that had been
tipped off and flat embarrassed,

190
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,360
convinced the world was against him.

191
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,620
Charles left for London on January the
10th when he arrived in his traditional

192
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:54,490
haven of Oxford.

193
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,040
He began raising an army.

194
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,731
In March,

195
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,920
parliament voted to raise their own.

196
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,873
By now,

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,820
everyone met a fairly good
idea of where this was heading.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,650
In August,

199
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,670
1642 the first English civil war finally
began pitching royalist forces against

200
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,780
parliaments army.

201
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,350
It would ultimately lead
to some 200,000 deaths.

202
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
Unfortunately for most,

203
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,860
but not all for Oliver Cromwell.

204
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:21,540
This would be the moment when he stepped
out of the shadows into the blinding

205
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,690
light of history from the get go chrome.

206
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:23,880
Well,

207
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,200
it was at the heart of the war,

208
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,380
even though he was just a farmer
with no fighting experience.

209
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,490
One of the very first engagements of
the conflicts came when he successfully

210
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,980
garrison Cambridge
against a royalist attack,

211
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,120
but it would be at the battle of edge
hill in October where chrome well really

212
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,020
became a soldier.

213
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,520
The battle was a stalemate,

214
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,390
but chrome well was able to witness
firsthand the effectiveness of the

215
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,111
royalists.

216
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:50,070
Horse mounted troops convinced the
parliamentarians needed cavalry to win the

217
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:50,520
war.

218
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,550
He had his back to east Anglia
to raise a mounted army.

219
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,200
It's almost impossible to overstate
how effective Cromwells horseman would

220
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:58,620
become.

221
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,620
By mid 1643 they'd security Stankonia
for parliaments in 1644 of the wipes the

222
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,760
floor with Charles,

223
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:09,630
his own amount of troops at the battle
of mustard more chrome well was such a

224
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,860
natural leader of men that he was soon
promoted to leftenant general and given

225
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:18,270
the nickname iron sight has men work
professional disciplines and loyal

226
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,450
qualities sorely lacking in the
rest of the parliamentary Ami.

227
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,260
In fact,

228
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,310
it was Cromwells obvious military skill
that stops him from exiting the story.

229
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,060
At this point,

230
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,550
fed up with XRS to Kratz
leading their army.

231
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:34,551
Parliament passed a motion in 1645 to
kick every MP and Lord out of the military

232
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,370
as MP Crockwell should have
been among the parliament,

233
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,270
passed a second law allowing him to
continue serving on to a new leader,

234
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,470
Thomas Fairfax.

235
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,190
They knew that winning the war
rested on Cromwells cavalry.

236
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,990
In 1645 Cromwells horseman played the
decisive role at the battle of Nazeem.

237
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,840
Here they effectively wipes
out the royalist army.

238
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,400
Charles held firm for another year,

239
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:59,730
but in 1646 Cromwells took
his stronghold of Oxford.

240
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,740
Charles floods into the
night disguised as a seven.

241
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,690
He traveled north and threw himself
on the mercy of his old enemies.

242
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,520
The Scots.

243
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,221
That's surprising me.

244
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:10,350
This got straight at him
doing glands and with that,

245
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,230
the first English civil war was over

246
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,590
remarkably for a regicide or dictates
that at well responded to Charles's

247
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,840
capture by trying to force
parliament to cut a deal with him.

248
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,680
Cromwells sincerely believed that the
only way forward was to restore Charles

249
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:30,670
the first of the throne,

250
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,290
only with a new constitution in place
to stop him running around and raising

251
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,240
taxes and dissolving parliaments.

252
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,200
The hero of the parliamentary cause even
droid a rebellion against parliament

253
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,330
that year using his
influence to four sounds,

254
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:46,390
11 presbytarian nps that
he considered anti Yami.

255
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,410
If Charles the first had been just at
a little bit less of a start on ass,

256
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,560
it would have all ended right at sadly
being an ass was Charles was old about

257
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,060
despite losing the war,

258
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:00,310
he refused to accept any
deal with parliaments.

259
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,820
Instead he got a secret deal with the
Scots to make the whole of Britain

260
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:08,821
presbytarian if they're just invade and
restore him to the throne and the Scots.

261
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,980
They agreed and so we come
to the embarrassments.

262
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,320
That is the second English civil war.

263
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,000
Embarrassing because of it's farcical,

264
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,080
lack of coordination.

265
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,790
Let's stop risings paralyzed Wales and
southern England in 1648 but the Scott's

266
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,220
didn't invade until
Cromwells well and Fairfax's.

267
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,350
He subdued them in August.

268
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,890
Well,

269
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,720
road north met the Scottish Armenians.

270
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,330
Annihilated adds so much for that.

271
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,920
However that what two important
outcomes from this second dustup.

272
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,910
The first was that the army forcibly
purged parliament of Mbas who didn't

273
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,650
support Cromwellian Fairfax.

274
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,210
This severely reduced lung
parliaments became known as the rump.

275
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,470
The second was that Charles,

276
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:50,650
his role in the Scottish invasion
was inevitably discovered.

277
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,900
We've Cromwells blessing the rump drags.

278
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:53,291
Charles,

279
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,390
before Isans held a mock trial,

280
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:55,901
Charles,

281
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,370
he was sentenced to death,

282
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,570
the 59 MBS,

283
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,271
including chrome,

284
00:12:59,271 --> 00:12:59,801
well dead,

285
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,870
to put their names on the execution order.

286
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,310
On January the 30th 1649 Charles
was publicly executed in London.

287
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,110
His head lopped off and hell's a loft
for the crowds to see unpopular as he

288
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:11,510
wants to.

289
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,620
It's thought Omnia a hundred I'll say
men in the whole of England wanted to see

290
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,370
him debt.

291
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,210
It's just a shame for Charles that one
of those men happened to be all if a

292
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,050
Commonweal.

293
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,350
Yup.

294
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,530
Powerful as chrome.

295
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,690
Well was at this stage.

296
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,900
He didn't just transition
straight to Ruder of Britain.

297
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,920
After Charles died,

298
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,690
it was the rump that now held supremacy
and chrome well was pretty fine with

299
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:32,050
that.

300
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,400
They supported his army
and besides history,

301
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:37,620
it's still had one major
task for him in 1650 chrome.

302
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:37,860
Well,

303
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,420
it was sent to end the Irish war.

304
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,530
The Irish rebellion had been bubbling
away in the background the entire time.

305
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,640
England was in chaos.

306
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,600
Now that the chaos was seeming the Ivr,

307
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:47,891
it was,

308
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:50,260
I mean natural that
England would want its way,

309
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,460
would province back,

310
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,530
sadly to achieve the same chrome.

311
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,050
Well did some Trudy terrible things.

312
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,920
Cromwell's massacre is a droid and
Wexford are still remembered for that

313
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:00,520
cruelty.

314
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,930
Both involved Cromwells besieging a town
then offering new quarter two soldiers

315
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,040
or civilians.

316
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,410
Thousands and thousands died.

317
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,010
While some historians have suggested
the scan of suffering was exaggerated.

318
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,180
Those little arguments,

319
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,340
both sieges comes to shooters,

320
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,240
atrocities still they did ends
the Irish rebellion and chrome,

321
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:23,200
well returned to England in 1650 just in
time to [inaudible] himself in the mess

322
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,630
of the third English civil war that,

323
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:25,801
yeah,

324
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:26,021
Charles,

325
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:26,711
his son Charles,

326
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:30,670
the second reopens his father's packs
with a Scotsman who was proclaimed king of

327
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:31,360
Scotland.

328
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,220
Parliament demanded
that Scott's be crushed,

329
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:35,470
but Thomas Fairfax
refused to attack first.

330
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,640
So chrome well was made commander in chief
and he was sending north in September

331
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,060
of 1651 he finally defeated the
Scots of the battle of Wooster.

332
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,060
And this marks the end of
the civil wars in Britain.

333
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,560
So what does a general,

334
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:48,041
he was one,

335
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,260
three civil wars and
crushed her rebellion.

336
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,350
Do in peacetime?

337
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:51,890
Well,

338
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,920
luckily for Cromwells,

339
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,180
different sort of war was
now brewing in Westminster.

340
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:01,181
The rump was getting mad with power
through 1652 to 1653 at Pasta.

341
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,870
No useful.

342
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,510
That just Alation except
to make itself immortal.

343
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,850
The rump has come into
being as a stop gap,

344
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,180
a temporary measure until the
wars were over into new elections,

345
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,080
could be called [inaudible].

346
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,620
Now they were voting to
end elections permanently.

347
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,450
By April,

348
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,170
1653 chrome well had had enough
in a delicious historic irony.

349
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,850
He sent troops into
Westminster echoing Charles,

350
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,090
his own breach of
parliament 11 years earlier.

351
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,990
A gunpoint.

352
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,823
He told the rump,

353
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,100
you have sat too long for any good you
have been doing lately and the name of

354
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,480
God go.

355
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,831
There are gone.

356
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,820
Grunwell gave parliament
one last shot in July,

357
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,770
1653 he convened a new national assembly,

358
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,140
popularly known as bad burns parliaments.

359
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,141
It's 144 members were hands picks for
vest saintliness grunwell expected them to

360
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,990
rule his new puritan Britain as
enlightened men and instead they voted to

361
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:56,850
dissolve themselves and handle all
the power over to Oliver Cromwell.

362
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,383
Okay.

363
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,190
Chrome whale is often portrayed
as a power hungry tyrants,

364
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,720
but all evidence indicates that he
really did try and refuse absolute power.

365
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,251
In the end,

366
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,460
the peak of the teenagers,

367
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,230
the 15th century tonight sort of Lord
protector was revived for his reign under

368
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:21,440
the new constitution was drawn up
known as the instrument of government.

369
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:25,580
It's spit power between Cromwells
they 15 men council of state and a new

370
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:28,730
parliaments of 400 elected
representatives from England,

371
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,510
Scotland,

372
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,620
Wales and Ireland.

373
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,840
This was actually kind of progressive.

374
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,140
Never before had Scotland or Ireland
had been guaranteed their own MBA's and

375
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:36,461
seats.

376
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:37,294
So the eds,

377
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,510
they'd got 30 each,

378
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,340
not that this miles progressive.

379
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:44,240
Ben Stopped to the parliamentary wheels
from soon falling off though elections

380
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,630
to the first protector at parliament
were held Fredy resulting in a swath of

381
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,100
presbytarian and Siyani free thinking
and Roya stem piece being returns.

382
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,461
Oh,

383
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,770
and also some of the members
from the rub came back.

384
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,930
Not exactly the biggest Cromwell.

385
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:57,111
Well,

386
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:01,220
fans chroma has hope that
the new parliament would
pass necessary legislation to

387
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,990
move England's off a war footing,

388
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,800
but instead they set about reducing
Cromwells powers when they tried to reduce

389
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,330
the Ami t allows it.

390
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,980
In January,

391
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,740
1655 Cromwells dissolve parliament.

392
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,370
The new dissolution came as word was
leaking out about Cromwells secret 1654

393
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:19,640
deal with Catholic France
to ally against Spain.

394
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,301
Once again,

395
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:24,170
English taxes were being used to finance
boneheaded adventuring volume over

396
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:24,870
bearing Monique,

397
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,860
you dissolve parliaments like
it was going out of fashion.

398
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,690
The irony was lost out on absolutely no
one and many of Cromwell's allies began

399
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,100
to turn against him still.

400
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,960
He wasn't broadly unpopular just yet.

401
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,580
There's a guy called Penn radic discovered
in March of 1655 sure that Cromwells

402
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:41,690
rule was about to collapse.

403
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,710
Penn Roddick organized a royalist uprising
intended to put Charles the second on

404
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,340
the throne.

405
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,151
He gathered man,

406
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:47,421
man,

407
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:51,810
set off across England's rallying locals
stores cause only for locals to shut

408
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,644
their doors to him.

409
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,530
Panic is men simply ran for their lives.

410
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,210
Penn radix dismal uprising.

411
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,310
It was crushed before I dealt with again.

412
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,370
Penn Roderick's uprising
may have been amateur hour,

413
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:07,030
but it gave chromeo the excuse he needed
to scrap the new constitution and set

414
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,460
up a military dictatorship,

415
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,510
England and Wales,

416
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:14,511
but split into 12 districts each under
the control of a desk spotting major

417
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:15,390
general,

418
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,470
hugely unpopular.

419
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,190
The system lasted barely a year before
Cranwell was forced to scrap it and

420
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,340
revive parliaments in September of 1656
only the seconds protector at parliament

421
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,420
wasn't freely elected.

422
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,650
Purged of Cromwells enemies stuffed with
toadies finally voted in February of

423
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,740
1657 to make Cranwell king.

424
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh yes.

425
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,140
He was really made king.

426
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,260
The very thing that chrome well
had fought so hard to read,

427
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,330
written off to be absolutely fair.

428
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,200
They Britain's entire system of
government relied on a king or queens,

429
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,490
give Roya sends ins,

430
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,600
wave things through.

431
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,420
So having one was something
of an urgent legal matter.

432
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,130
It does not mean it's chrome
world was on an idea king and all,

433
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,973
but name.

434
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,030
He was totally referred
to as his highness.

435
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:00,870
He lived in Charles the first solid palace
and was handing out nights do all of

436
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:01,591
his friends.

437
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:02,424
So yeah,

438
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,570
that's what a king does.

439
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,100
Andrian the 26 1657 protector at
Britain decided to make it official.

440
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,200
Cromwell was crowns in
our lavish ceremony.

441
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:13,530
That was almost in every
respect a coronation.

442
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,830
The only difference was that he kept
to the Lord protector title instead of

443
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:17,664
becoming King.

444
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,130
If you're struggling
to see the difference.

445
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:20,401
Yeah.

446
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:20,760
Well,

447
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,100
so in many of Cromwells old comrades,

448
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,690
in fact,

449
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,330
they were struggling to see the difference
between the protector is and the is

450
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:27,801
of Charles,

451
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,100
his personal rule.

452
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,900
King Oliver was levying taxes.

453
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:35,400
Do you fight pointless wars and dissolving
parliaments at the drop of a crown?

454
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:35,780
Oh yes.

455
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,980
And we're not done yet because
he totally did it again.

456
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,750
In February,

457
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,310
1658 the second protector at parliament
voted to grow a backbone and readmit MPs

458
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:46,120
excluded by Cromwells man.

459
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,930
So that was it for the
second protector parliaments,

460
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,680
the last few months of Cromwells life
saw him withdraw from public affairs.

461
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,360
His daughter Elizabeth died of cancer
in early 1658 and it seems something in

462
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:57,561
chrome.

463
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:57,891
Well,

464
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,720
some vital spark just vanished.

465
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,660
He stopped receiving people
or even really ruling.

466
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,170
Perhaps he realized what he'd
become and was disgusted by it.

467
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,753
Perhaps not.

468
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,790
On September the third 1658 the man who
was almost king Oliver passed away that

469
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:13,950
night.

470
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,150
A terrific storm.

471
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,900
Racketing vins houses were torn
apart and scattered by the winds.

472
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,000
Ships sank beneath the rolling waves.

473
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,170
It was said that the storm was Satan
come to take theater door to protect us

474
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:25,770
soul.

475
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,820
Although the protector,

476
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:30,960
it would survive another year under
Cromwells son Richard did effectively died

477
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:31,421
with chrome.

478
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:31,650
Well,

479
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,550
Richard would last less than a year
before being deposed and replaced with the

480
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,480
revived rump.

481
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,510
The Rambaud in Zen barely reconvened
before an army general known as George

482
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,610
Monka marched on London and ordered the
rump to readmit it's excluded members.

483
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,290
Long Parliament was then revived,

484
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,750
just long enough vote
for it's own solution.

485
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,540
Then you convention parliament that
followed in 1660 immediately voted to

486
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,970
restore Charles the second to the throne,

487
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,710
so the English interregnum ends it.

488
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,480
Charles the second was on the throne with
the only new limitations on his powers

489
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,160
being those proposed by the long
parliaments back in 1640 everything that

490
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,180
happens in the intervening two decades,

491
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,410
the three English civil wars,

492
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,180
the Irish rebellion,

493
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,013
the protectors,

494
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,040
they all became effectively pointless.

495
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,410
Cranwell had raised an
army and killed a king,

496
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,970
but within two years of his death,

497
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:18,340
his achievements that all turned to dust.

498
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,490
On January the 30th 1661 Cromwells body
was disinterred 12 years to the day of

499
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:24,101
Charles,

500
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,580
the first sex education alongside
the corpses of two other prominent

501
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:28,570
parliamentarians.

502
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:32,500
It was symbolically hung at Tibor
and gallows before being beheaded.

503
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,740
As late as 1685 you could still see the
former lord protectors head on a spike

504
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:39,010
outside Westminster.

505
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,410
It was all the bloodshed
for nothing without a doubt.

506
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:44,110
Cromwells did some terrible
things during his long career.

507
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,040
He committed atrocities in Ireland and
this personal ambition turned what could

508
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,830
have been the world's first
liberal revolution into it,

509
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:51,431
like Ganache,

510
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:52,030
flop.

511
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,780
It would fall to American and French
revolutionaries over a century later to

512
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,850
complete what the English had started.

513
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,880
But Cranwell was also
a truly great general,

514
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,750
a leader of men who could stand shoulder
to shoulder with Washington or bolivar

515
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,830
without Cromwells.

516
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,400
You have no parliamentarian victory
in the English civil wars without

517
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,390
parliaments victory.

518
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,840
None of the ideas that would lead to
influence the founding fathers gain any

519
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:14,920
traction from,

520
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:15,310
well,

521
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,940
he was an ogre,

522
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,751
death spot fool,

523
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:17,560
and a failure.

524
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,260
He was also the man who
kills a tyrant king.

525
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,430
And in doing so,

526
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
I should in our modern world.

527
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,660
So I really hope you found the video.

528
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:26,170
