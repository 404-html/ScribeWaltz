00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,860
My Japanese pronunciation
is not brilliant,

7
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,690
so bear with me in this video.

8
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:17,800
I have a computer here.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,050
I'm looking up the stuff when I can.

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,790
Sometimes I fail.

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,350
If you want to have a go
at me in the comments,

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,400
go right ahead.

13
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,570
During World War Two,

14
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:26,600
in the second Seleno,

15
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,650
Japanese war dogs named Shiro issue
was responsible for creating biological

16
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,770
weapons of mass destruction is she built
a laboratory in Manchuria cooled unit

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,650
7:31 on behalf of the
Japanese government's.

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,050
Its goal was to create a weapon so deadly.

19
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,720
It could wipe out the
population of Japan's enemies.

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,000
He used nibbling Chinese villages as
as human Guinea pigs for these bundled

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,230
trickle weapons and experimented on men,

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,333
women,

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,300
and even children.

24
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,351
When the war was over,

25
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:56,920
the United States learned about
Shiro Ishii sadistic experiments.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,340
While many of the Nazis were sentenced
to death for that crimes against

27
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:00,911
humanity.

28
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,710
And Europe's concentration camps,

29
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,200
Shero issue was allowed to go free.

30
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,940
So what would drive someone to become
one of the most evil men in history and

31
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:11,410
why on earth we see it,

32
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,120
I have to get away with mass murder.

33
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,631
Well,

34
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:16,390
that's what we're looking at
in this week's by graphics.

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,060
Shiro Ishii was born in 1892 in a
village called Shitty Yama in the Chiba

36
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,000
Prefecture of Japan.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,380
His parents were wealthy landowners
that came from a long line of Daimyos or

38
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,250
feudal lords,

39
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,070
who owns the most land in any given area.

40
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,420
The Japanese system of prefectures or
states have only just begun in the 1870.

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,470
So his parents were very powerful and
still had a lot of control over the

42
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:53,180
government and the Chiba Prefecture.

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,171
Throughout history,

44
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:58,100
these wealthy landowners benefited from
indentured servants who farms the fields

45
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:02,360
and they weren't able to enjoy a lavish
lifestyle even into the 19th century.

46
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,850
These descendants of the dime year,

47
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:07,280
we're still very much benefiting
from their family's fortunes.

48
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,061
At the same time,

49
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,560
the Japanese people looked
up to the emperor of Japan
with a godlike admiration,

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,360
even though they logically knew
the imperial family were mortals,

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,600
they still had a very strong sense of
loyalty and they believe that the life of

52
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:24,680
someone living in the lower class was
truly not as valuable as someone from the

53
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,514
optic loss.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,150
Because of this Japanese mindset share
real issue was raised to believe that he

55
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:34,151
truly was far more important than most
people know much else is known about his

56
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,941
younger years.

57
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:38,510
Except to say that it would seem
like his path seems very linear.

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,590
It is almost as if all of
his life experiences were
preparing him to experiment

59
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,430
on human beings without
any sense of remorse.

60
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,201
Sure is.

61
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,160
She studied medicine it Kyoto,

62
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,450
imperial university,

63
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,500
but he wasn't interested in becoming a
doctor who heals the common people in a

64
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:55,100
hospital.

65
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,790
He became a surgeon for the
Imperial Japanese army in 1920.

66
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,610
One earns the rank of leftenant.

67
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,140
His superiors were impressed
with his surgical skill,

68
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,700
so they sent him to the army medical
school in Tokyo for further training.

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,440
They also paid for him to start doing a
postgraduate medicine program at Kyo to

70
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,680
imperial university,

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,630
even though he did
become a medical doctor,

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,171
like we said,

73
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,490
he wasn't interested in healing.

74
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,320
Patients was far more fascinated
with studying and experimentation.

75
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,220
You had a particular love of
biology and particularly bacteria.

76
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,460
It used to grow deadly bacteria in petri
dishes and he called them his pets in

77
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,460
the 1920.

78
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,330
[inaudible] finished his many years of
medical school and went on a two year

79
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,430
trip around the world
to visit 30 countries.

80
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,240
He was particularly fascinated with
staying in Germany so that he could study

81
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,240
the poison gasses that that
romy used during World War One.

82
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,640
Chlorine gas had been
used as a weapon of war,

83
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,280
but both sides began to use gas masks.

84
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,050
As far as she was concerned,

85
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,040
gas was no longer an effective
means of killing another soldier.

86
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,790
In 1931,

87
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:06,080
the Chinese territory of Manchuria was
taken over by Japan during these seconds.

88
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,490
Sino Japanese war,

89
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,240
and this was a huge victory for Japan
and they were already occupying Korea.

90
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,650
They were feeling very confident that
they could spread this embar to conquer

91
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,900
the entire rest of China.

92
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,321
Sure,

93
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:22,670
if she saw this new Manchurian territory
is a perfect opportunity for him to

94
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:26,810
take his theoretical ideas of
biological weapons and make them into a

95
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,100
devastating reality,

96
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,530
just like an evil villain in a bond movie.

97
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:35,510
He was searching for a plague that was
capable of wiping out the entire human

98
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:39,050
race or at least the enemies
of the Japanese empire.

99
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,130
At this point,

100
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,730
surely she had such a powerful position
in the military and government that he

101
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:48,200
was able to personally approach
the emperor and request
the funding to create an

102
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,520
arbitrary in Manchuria.

103
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,080
Off to that permission was granted.

104
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,440
He built a massive
compounds called unit 7:31.

105
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,880
It was officially called the epidemic
prevention in water supply unit because

106
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:03,350
its true purpose of studying biological
weapons was supposed to remain a secret.

107
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,040
They were given a huge budget which
they spent on state of the art equipment

108
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,200
unit 7:31 was similar to
a Nazi concentration camp
and that it was an entire

109
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:14,870
campus of buildings which
included holding cells,

110
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,100
medical facilities,

111
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,620
and a gigantic crematorium.

112
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,830
The administration building
where she worked with so strong,

113
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,070
it was the last building left
standing after being bombed.

114
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:25,341
Yes,

115
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,060
later,

116
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,440
but of course you can't have human
experimentation without test subjects.

117
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,420
The Japanese can pace on military.

118
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:33,310
Police would grab it,

119
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,770
Chinese people off the streets
of their villages on arrest them.

120
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,100
They were put on trains
that arrived at unit 7:31,

121
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,590
and they were never allowed
to see their families again.

122
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,300
They captured all ages of men,

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,781
women,

124
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:48,440
and even young children because they
wanted to see how these weapons affected

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,120
all types of people.

126
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,340
According to the military
doctors who worked there,

127
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:54,190
they were forced to work at unit seven,

128
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,410
31 without really even knowing what
they're getting themselves into.

129
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,431
Upon arrival,

130
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,420
they would find doctors,

131
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:03,740
injecting Chinese people with a deadly
disease like anthrax or you'd be

132
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,603
bottleneck plague.

133
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,890
If they spoke out against the experiments.

134
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,680
It would be treason and they
could be executed for us,

135
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,720
for those who were forced
to work in unit seven,

136
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,350
31,

137
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,240
they had to believe that this was all
just a part of war and killing the

138
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:19,160
civilians was no different
than bombing an enemy country.

139
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,850
In fact,

140
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,600
they believed that their actions were
far more noble than the average soldier

141
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,330
because they killed in
the name of science.

142
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,250
Doctors would dissect human beings while
they were still alive without using any

143
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,084
anesthetic.

144
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,180
They wanted to see what organs look like
while they were still functioning and

145
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,840
to learn exactly how the disease
would cause these organs to fail.

146
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,190
Some of the subjects were given a vaccine
to the plague first before exposing

147
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,150
them to the disease.

148
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,841
This way,

149
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,080
they were able to know exactly what
the strongest vaccines were for the

150
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,850
deadliest diseases in the wells.

151
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,620
Once they affected the formula,

152
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:55,610
they were able to create enough
antidotes for all of Japan in this way.

153
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,790
Unit 7:31 was making
breakthroughs and modern medicine,

154
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,790
but it was at the expense of
a great many Chinese lives.

155
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,751
They're holding cells.

156
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,620
They were large enough that they
could hold up to 600 people at a time.

157
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,540
They called these people meritus,

158
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,980
which means logs,

159
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,170
which only further to humanize them.

160
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,820
The average lifespan for these prisoners
was only four to six weeks when their

161
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,410
bodies were done being used.

162
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,380
They were thrown in a pile
and burned in the crematorium,

163
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,270
in his laboratory Sheria.

164
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:31,500
She was experimenting
with the Bubonic Plague,

165
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:35,400
which is known for being one of the
most deadly diseases in history,

166
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,700
but he didn't want it to be the same
place that we remember from the past.

167
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,900
He genetically altered it to be extremely
potent and far more capable of killing

168
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:45,840
people than any previous
strain of the plague.

169
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,570
The bubonic plague can only
be transferred through blood,

170
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,100
so he wanted to release disease,

171
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:54,720
written fleas on unsuspecting villages
in order to test how strong it truly was.

172
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,860
They collected ramps,

173
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:59,670
which were perfect incubators for
thousands upon thousands of fleas,

174
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,380
and the insects were Catholic,

175
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,030
gathered and put into containers.

176
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,170
First round of experiments had airplanes
dropping baskets full of fleas into

177
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,250
Chinese villages,

178
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,941
civilians,

179
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:11,250
and it worked exactly as they had hoped.

180
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,990
Between 1939 and 1942 plagues
began to spread in these villages.

181
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,680
One third of the total population
of each village was wiped out.

182
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,760
These manufactured plagues were so potent
that once they were infected people

183
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,060
which is die within one to two days,

184
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,750
according to testimony by a
man named Gene [inaudible],

185
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,840
his sister was infected with this mega
plague after being bitten by one of the

186
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:34,261
fleas.

187
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,270
The glands in her neck was so swollen,

188
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:37,740
it was as large as a hat.

189
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,280
She knew that if she stayed inside
and received medical treatment,

190
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,720
she would in fact the rest of
our family with the plague,

191
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:47,090
so she had to go into the
middle of a field and die alone.

192
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,360
Their family members could not get near
her and they had no choice but to burn

193
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:53,370
her body in the field where she lay.

194
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,850
While baskets full of fleas have
worked with low flying planes,

195
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:57,200
shearer,

196
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,650
she knew that if he wanted to,

197
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,150
in fact enemy countries,

198
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,450
they would need to drop actual
bombs filled with fleas.

199
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,130
The only issue was that the fleas would,

200
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,791
of course,

201
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,120
Diane,

202
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,953
the explosion.

203
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,630
He figured out that by
creating clay pot containers,

204
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,530
he could drop a so called germ bomb that
would smash when it's at the grounds

205
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:15,210
and the fleas would stay alive,

206
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,210
but they didn't just stop
at the bubonic plague.

207
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,990
They experiments with
anthrax and typhoid as well.

208
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,690
After dropping these bombs on
even more Chinese villages,

209
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:28,860
the Japanese soldiers showed up in all
the white lab suits covering their entire

210
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:29,430
body.

211
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,070
They would command villages to come
out of their homes and they would find

212
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:36,780
subjects who had been infected by the
plague and performed dissections in the

213
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,030
middle of a field while their friends
and family watched on to share issue.

214
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,650
It was all about gathering
data and statistics.

215
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,790
These people,

216
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,500
they were just numbers on a page.

217
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:48,590
They were not actual human life stem.

218
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,090
The campaign were even given candy from
unit 7:31 and instructed to show up to

219
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,910
villages and hand out the
Swedes to small children.

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,090
While Chinese villages interpreted
this as an act of kindness,

221
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,000
the Kenzie was actually
laced with anthrax.

222
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,530
The scientists would later arrive and
observe parents beginning to panic as

223
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,660
their children died in their arms.

224
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,883
As time went on,

225
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,920
the unit expanded their human
experiments beyond diseases.

226
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,180
They also did experiments on frostbite
and the effects of shrapnel wounds.

227
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,800
This involved strapping people down to
a wooden plank before blowing up a bomb

228
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:23,634
next to them.

229
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,290
All of this was just so they could study
how a human would be blown apart by

230
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,640
different types of weapons,

231
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,780
so I think now is probably a
good time for a little breather.

232
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:35,310
This one's a bit intense.

233
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,390
I mean science.

234
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,810
It's responsible for the devastation
of lives as we're seeing in this video,

235
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:43,860
but is also responsible for the
saving of millions used the right way.

236
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,650
Science changes the welds in
remarkable ways for the better,

237
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,280
and that's why I'm pleased in this video
to tell you about brilliance and I know

238
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:50,791
as always,

239
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,360
these ads in the middle of their less
than awesome but brilliance are fantastic

240
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:57,900
for sponsoring this sort of longer
content because it allows us to share the

241
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,080
darker lessons from scientific
history in a thoughtful way.

242
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,620
Brilliance on science learning platform
that allow youtube learned through

243
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,520
active learning,

244
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:09,810
which summed up is basically the opposite
of that feeling of reading a complex

245
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:14,430
paragraph about some principle and then
just having absolutely no clue what on

246
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,310
earth was going on about even on the 10,

247
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:16,590
three,

248
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:16,950
three,

249
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,210
and they don't just cover the basics,

250
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,590
although they do cover those as well,

251
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,890
but it goes through to really complex
things like advanced statistics.

252
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,380
I was recently going through
a course on statistics,

253
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,450
particularly the one
lying with statistics.

254
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:31,710
It's an amazing primer on how to be
aware of when the media is misusing

255
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,070
statistics to push your
opinion one way or the other.

256
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,890
Brilliant makes even complex
statistical concepts,

257
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,820
easy to understand.

258
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,740
They give you something
super short to read.

259
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,940
It's very easy and then you immediately
apply it to a problem and then you just

260
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,670
rinse and repeat that and all of a sudden
you're understanding things that you

261
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,930
never thought you would be.

262
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,340
I've been using brilliant for a while.

263
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,830
You should just give it a go to see
how easy it is to start understanding

264
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,790
complex subjects so they support
biographics going to brilliant.org,

265
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,200
forward slash graphics,

266
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,440
and now let's get back to abusing science.

267
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,700
Even though Shiraishi and unit seven,

268
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,720
31 had developed these deadly weapons,

269
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:16,920
they never made this public knowledge
or threatened to use the German bombs.

270
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,060
Some historians believe
that if the Americans knew
about these bioweapons ahead

271
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:21,541
of time,

272
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,740
they would have never dropped the atomic
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki for

273
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,450
fear of mutual destruction.

274
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,650
But if you think the allied powers were
safe from the sadistic experiments going

275
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,240
on in Manchuria well,

276
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,140
think again.

277
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,441
Sure.

278
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:38,430
If she plans a long distance attack on
the United States schools mission cherry

279
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,390
blossoms at night.

280
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,320
They attempted to launch balloons that
were filled with deadly diseases like

281
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:43,801
cholera.

282
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:47,910
Smallpox in the bubonic plague is
whether it's anthrax and botulism and

283
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,530
estimated 9,000 balloons,

284
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,090
web center across the Pacific Ocean,

285
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:55,080
but only 345 of them actually
made it to the United States.

286
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,770
Many of them were shot down in some
landed in the ocean or in forest.

287
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:02,160
So fields considering there were a
lot of Ufo sightings at the time.

288
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,550
It might be possible that some people
were seeing these gen buildings and

289
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,020
mistaking them for something else.

290
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,580
It was actually only one of these,

291
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,121
the course,

292
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,954
any casualties.

293
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,790
It landed in a town called bly,

294
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,320
Oregon on May the fifth,

295
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,741
19,

296
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:14,574
45,

297
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,570
a Sunday school teacher named Elsie
Metro was on a day trip going on a picnic

298
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:21,820
and the mountains with a small
group of our teenage students,

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,410
husbands,

300
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:22,800
archie,

301
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,890
who was also that minister was
driving the car up the mountain.

302
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,460
Elsie was a few months pregnant and
she got sick during the car ride.

303
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,130
Husband pulled over to better
around to get some APP.

304
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,120
They had parked near a crew of men who
were doing construction work on the road.

305
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,070
The students in llc decided to take a
short walk through the woods and archie

306
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,460
began to speak with the men.

307
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,110
He then heard his wife's voice say,

308
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
look what I found.

309
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,113
Yeah.

310
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,260
Followed by an explosion lc.

311
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,320
You had come across one of the balloons.

312
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,350
She had no idea that it was
actually a bomb and approaching it.

313
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,630
She triggered the explosion
archie in the crew.

314
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:58,680
He ran towards the sounds and they
found the bodies of LLC into group of

315
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,540
students lying dead on the ground.

316
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,081
Well,

317
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,420
most Americans were kept
safe from Sherry issues,

318
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,081
experiments.

319
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:06,610
Those who were stationed in
Asia during World War Two,

320
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,170
well,

321
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,010
they weren't so lucky in 1944 and
1945 American prisoners of war.

322
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,220
We're in a city called mud can.

323
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,490
They were visited by Japanese doctors.

324
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,330
Many of them had already been in
captivity for several years at this point.

325
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,040
The Japanese wanted to see if the results
were any difference on different races

326
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,180
and objected the men with various
deadly diseases and repeated the exact

327
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:29,730
experiments that were done on the Chinese.

328
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,750
Many of these men died and the ones who
survived were only kept around so they

329
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,880
could carry away the
bodies of their friends

330
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,520
when World War Two was over,

331
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,390
the allied forces,

332
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:48,410
one is that they took away power
from Emperor Hirohito in Manchuria.

333
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,450
China had defeated the Japanese as well.

334
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,410
There was nowhere left for issued
to hide Nazi war criminals.

335
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:58,760
They were being brought to trial
in Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946,

336
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:02,570
and many of them were being sentenced to
death for the crimes against humanity.

337
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,350
The Japanese military still awarded
Shero issue with medals of honor into

338
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,540
healthy pension for his retirement.

339
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,560
In their eyes,

340
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,940
he was a hero for the country,

341
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:13,730
but he knew that America
would not feel the same,

342
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,910
especially once they had the stories from
the POW use Shiro Ishii commanded his

343
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:23,210
doctors and soldiers to never speak of
the experiments that went on in unit

344
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:24,140
7:31,

345
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,010
but of course they learned about the
experiments through the American soldiers

346
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,560
who survived the American
government's approached issue,

347
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,090
but instead of arresting him,

348
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,470
they asked to make a deal.

349
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,470
They wanted his data in
exchange for immunity.

350
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,180
Sure is.

351
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,610
She knew that this was the
only way he could save himself.

352
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,340
He promised that if they
pardoned all of his crimes,

353
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:47,390
the US government could benefit from
having all of the scientific information

354
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,880
that they had gathered
from their experiments.

355
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,260
In the United States.

356
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:55,160
There are ethical laws in place so that
American scientists are never allowed to

357
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,440
experiment on human beings by law.

358
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,390
They can only experiments on animals.

359
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,201
For this reason,

360
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:03,980
the government knew that these experiments
were truly valuable because it was

361
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:07,310
information that they would never
be able to receive on their own.

362
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,640
It's one thing to inject a rat
or a rabbit with a disease,

363
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:15,440
but it's a totally different thing to
actually know the results on human beings

364
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,460
and more importantly,

365
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:20,990
the Americans would gain access to the
vaccines that it wishy develops some of

366
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,240
the deadliest diseases known to mankind.

367
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,590
They agreed to trade his data in exchange
for his life and they even paid him

368
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,920
$250,000 and in modern money,

369
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,170
that's about two point 6 million.

370
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,010
All of the scientists and soldiers
who were involved with unit seven,

371
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:37,551
31,

372
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:41,150
we're happy to keep the secrets because
they were deeply ashamed of their

373
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,650
participation with a project.

374
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,180
Some of them even felt too ashamed to
return to Japan because they were afraid

375
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:48,560
that people would learn about that.

376
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,240
Crime's a few of them even
trying to live in China,

377
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,340
runs new identities.

378
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,150
The New York Times tried to expose this
by publishing an article about is human

379
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,770
experiments in 1946,

380
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:02,420
but the owns that the events gains for
a little media attention since all of

381
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,160
these atrocities happened in Nigeria,

382
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,800
they were technically a
part of the second signer,

383
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:07,581
Japanese war,

384
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:08,630
and not World War Two.

385
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,320
Even though both wars were happening
simultaneously for Americans,

386
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:16,250
it was overshadowed by the thousands of
testimonies coming out of Europe about

387
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,084
the Holocaust,

388
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,130
but of course the Chinese people,

389
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,240
they have not forgotten.

390
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,620
Even to this day in many Chinese people
still hate the Japanese for what happens

391
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,573
during this war.

392
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,241
However,

393
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,910
most Japanese civilians
were unaware of issues,

394
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:29,750
human experiments,

395
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:33,260
and they consider themselves to
be mostly victims of the war.

396
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,500
After the nuclear bombs were
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

397
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,070
the Japanese surrendered since there
was never the chance for them to start a

398
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,900
massive global plague.

399
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,110
So what about those pow?

400
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,500
In the 19 forties,

401
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:45,891
governments,

402
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:49,890
officials approached them and demanded
that they sign a nondisclosure contract.

403
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,310
They promised never to expose the truth
about what had happened to them in

404
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:54,144
Manchuria.

405
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,541
However,

406
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,410
in the 19 eighties,

407
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,220
many of those soldiers felt that they
had nothing left to lose and they came

408
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,820
forward to testify that they had been
a part of these human experiments.

409
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,050
It wasn't until the 19 nineties that
Japan officially acknowledged that unit

410
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:10,890
7:31 was real and it wasn't
just a conspiracy theory.

411
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Shiro Ishii Windsor live into old age
and he died at the age of 67 even after

412
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:17,214
the wars were over.

413
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,480
That plagues that share wishy unleashed
in China continue to spread and kill

414
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:25,530
people for years to come is exact
number of victims is unknown.

415
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,590
Some estimate that he was
responsible for tens of thousands,

416
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,070
well,

417
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,700
others say the number would be in
the hundreds of thousands of people.

418
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,580
So I really hope you found
that video interesting.
