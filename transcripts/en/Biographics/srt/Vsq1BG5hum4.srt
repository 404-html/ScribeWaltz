1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,620
The leading generals of World War Two,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:03,920
you carried a huge weight
on their shoulders.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,970
Their decisions could mean the difference
between life and death for thousands

4
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:11,330
of men and their actions helped
shape the fate of nations.

5
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:13,400
History has judged some of them as falls.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,020
Others as butches and a handful of
Basil military geniuses view that,

7
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:19,190
at least on the airline side,

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:22,160
have generated as much
controversy in life and death.

9
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:23,810
As George S.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:23,960
Patton,

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,170
the flamboyance American commander
never lost a major battle,

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,500
but his explosive temper
almost cost him his career.

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,450
He survived two world wars,

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,860
often placing himself in considerable
danger in lead to die in unlikely

15
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:39,830
circumstances within
months of Germany's defeat.

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,460
The unconventional general
was a devout Christian,

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,300
and yet he believed he was just the latest
incarnation of a warrior spirit who'd

18
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:49,910
once fought alongside the
likes of Julius Caesar,

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,290
Napoleon Bonaparte,

20
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,040
and others.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,080
He was the epitome of the rough,

22
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:58,970
tough warrior who reveled in his macho
image and seemingly lived only for war,

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,750
but he could be a surprisingly sensitive
individual who cried at funerals and

24
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:03,381
even pens,

25
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:06,020
poetry doing this for most of his life.

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,430
In this biographics video.

27
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,490
We're going to dive right into
the details of this man's life.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,400
[inaudible]

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,360
Georgia is passive.

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:32,491
Well,

31
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,840
he was born in California on
the 11th 1885 20 years earlier.

32
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,810
The paths and family had lost a bunch of
their wealth when they found themselves

33
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,000
on the losing side of American civil war.

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,631
However,

35
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,920
by the time of George's birth,

36
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,500
capacitors were prosperous
and they were influential.

37
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,334
Once again,

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,420
the young George Welch,

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,950
he knew from an early age that he wanted
to be a soldier is main obstacles to

40
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,470
doing this where his weaknesses
in maths and English,

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,600
this wasn't a result
of any lack of ability,

42
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,630
but rather his father's
mistrust of form and education,

43
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,500
which meant that George had to descended
school until he reached 12 years of

44
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,010
age.

45
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,390
He caught up quickly but only narrowly
passed the entrance exam for West Point.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,410
America's most prestigious military
academy while pattern would regularly

47
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:17,520
clashed with his superiors during World
War Two is conduct at West Point's was

48
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,390
exemplary.

49
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,540
He was particularly successful that
sports such as Polo and football,

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,410
playing with some relentless
aggression that he broke several bones.

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,640
He would lead to bring this
aggression to his method of waging war

52
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,990
patterns,

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,640
considerable sporting ability.

54
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:46,200
It did not go on notice to do a selected
to represent the United States of

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,820
America in the modern pentathlon at the
1912 Stockholm and then big games he

56
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,220
would could be,

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,811
is it writing,

58
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,201
shooting,

59
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:52,651
fencing,

60
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:52,981
running,

61
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,730
and sweating.

62
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,980
All things that pattern excels at.

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,731
Interestingly,

64
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:59,920
in the event it was patterns
shooting that may let him down.

65
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,360
He fired 20 bullets,

66
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,070
but the judges ruled that three of
them had missed the target pattern,

67
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,130
remained adamant that his aim but actually
been too good and his shots and pass

68
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,420
through the whole he'd
already made and the Bullseye.

69
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,360
It is possible that he was corrected,

70
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,310
but the judge is ultimately
ruled against him.

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,420
At the end of the first day pattern was
placed in a slightly disappointing 21st

72
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,860
from a 41 competitors.

73
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,370
Strong performances in each
of the remaining events
that saw him climb all the

74
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,630
way to fifth place.

75
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,990
It was the first and last time
he competed in the Olympic Games,

76
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,550
but he didn't have to wait long to test
the accuracy of his shooting in a combat

77
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,361
situation.

78
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,194
Yeah.

79
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,040
By 1916 most of the world's great
powers were locked together in seemingly

80
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,420
interminable conduct.

81
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,040
Only the United States thus far succeeded
in avoiding being drawn into the

82
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,770
slaughter.

83
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,210
However,

84
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,210
Lyrica did suffer a surprise attack
from the direction of Mexico on Boston.

85
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,570
1916 400 heavily armed bandits led by
notorious Francisco pantry video stormed

86
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,920
across the border for two hours.

87
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:13,690
They ran Saxons lucid the border town
of Columbus before finally being chased

88
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,770
away by the cavalry.

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,740
If Divia believed he could
hide out safely in Mexico,

90
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,221
well,

91
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,720
he was sorely mistaken.

92
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,040
President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the
u s army crossed the border and put an

93
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,060
end to the threat.

94
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,230
John Pershing was given commands of the
Expeditionary Force and he chose pattern

95
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:32,650
to serve as his eight Pason would go
on to become famous for his skill.

96
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,200
That commanding fast
moving motorized forces,

97
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,660
so it's perhaps fitting
that one in Mexico.

98
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:42,160
He took part in the first motorized
action in the history of warfare traveling

99
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:46,390
in three dodge touring cars pattern
and his men launched a raid on videos

100
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,200
henchman.

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,600
When the smoke cleared at
the end of a brief firefight,

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,920
three of his bodyguards lay debt pass
an audit their bodies to be strapped to

103
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,990
the cars for the drive
back to headquarters.

104
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,501
Pershing,

105
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:56,711
well,

106
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:00,460
he was apparently impressed
reportedly saying this pattern boy,

107
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,750
he's a real fighter.

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,740
On the 6th of April,

109
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,800
1917 the United States of America declared
war on Germany and entered World War

110
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:18,740
One.

111
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,820
Pershing was giving commands
if the American expeditionary
force and once again

112
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:25,070
he took George Patton at his side.

113
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,140
Pershing offered him
an infantry battalion,

114
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:30,500
but by that time that passenger
had become fascinated by tanks.

115
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,490
They were powerful,

116
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,060
yet unreliable weapons that were still
in their infancy since they'd been

117
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,750
unleashed by the British at the song.

118
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,770
In September of 1916 he became the
first officer assigned to the American

119
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,250
Expeditionary Force tank.

120
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,730
Core ams was at one of the first Americans
to learn how to operate a tank and

121
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,930
it's personally towards the first
cruise to be assigned to the tank corps.

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,950
The American Expeditionary Force tank
core finally went into action in September

123
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:59,650
of 1918 with pattern riding battle or
clinging to the outside of one of them

124
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,380
machines.

125
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,730
Please.

126
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,521
That same month though,

127
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:05,030
he would be badly injured in an
act of near suicide or bravery,

128
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,940
world war one tanks that they
were seriously underpowered.

129
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,350
They were unreliable and they were totally
vulnerable without infantry support.

130
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,151
So when his tanks,

131
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:14,000
it became isolated.

132
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,770
During the Meuse Argonne offensive.

133
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,340
Patton calls for volunteers to
help him storm the German lines.

134
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,830
Only five men have stepped forward.

135
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,850
They were quickly cut it down by a hail
of German bullets patterned himself.

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,100
He was badly injured
by a piece of shrapnel,

137
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,240
which hits him in the fight.

138
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,730
He continued to direct to
the battle for Michelle.

139
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:36,020
Hobo anti later refused medical treatment
until he had completed and submitted

140
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,770
his report.

141
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,610
Patton's injuries,

142
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,870
while they weren't life threatening,

143
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,160
they were serious.

144
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,280
So by the time he had recovered
sufficiently to resend it to combat,

145
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,700
well,

146
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,820
the armistice had been signed and
the guns said form and sign it

147
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,390
fall class and his time at the
front lines haven't been brief.

148
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:58,570
He had done more than enough
to demonstrate that he
possessed the kinds of raw

149
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:02,200
courage he expected and demanded
of those who served under him.

150
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,590
Okay.

151
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,710
With a great war or is it ends passing
[inaudible] of the United States of

152
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,020
America where he founds a
good deal to keep him busy.

153
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,250
He learns to fly drones.

154
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,590
The latest automobile sales is
a yacht mixed with high society.

155
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:26,750
He kept a stable of horses
and one hundreds of trophies
and ribbons in numerous

156
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:27,680
sporting events,

157
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,780
such an extravagant lifestyle would
ordinarily be well out of reach for him.

158
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,291
Majors,

159
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,080
salary.

160
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,501
However,

161
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:38,120
in 1910 patented married
Beatrice [inaudible] of the
extremely wealthy rs of a

162
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:39,440
Boston industrialist,

163
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,981
the battens.

164
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,161
Well,

165
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,260
they had enough money to do
pretty much whatever they wanted,

166
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,940
but George never wavered from his belief
that he was destined to be a great

167
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:47,750
soldier.

168
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,380
He maintained a special interest in
armored warfare and some visionaries.

169
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:55,940
We're proclaiming the tanks would
become the decisive weapon in any future

170
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,600
conflicts.

171
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,410
Hines Gadarian in Germany and
Charles de Gaulle in France,

172
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,290
I'll give the tanks,

173
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:04,520
would return mobility to the battlefields
punching through enemy positions to

174
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,560
create havoc in the rear passenger.

175
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,800
He was thinking along similar lines and
he got the chance to test out some of

176
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,371
his ideas.

177
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:15,371
In 1941 when the U s army held fast war
games across the states of Louisiana and

178
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:16,580
Carolina,

179
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,820
more than 400,000 soldiers and 1000
Aircrafts took part in mock battles,

180
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,520
held over 30,000 square
miles with Germany.

181
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,680
Once again at war with Britain and Russia.

182
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,250
Ben's no guarantees that America
would be able to remain neutral.

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,170
It was a much needed opportunities.

184
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,450
You get to test out
tactics and equipments.

185
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,770
It also served as a test of the men who
would lead America's armies into battle.

186
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,510
The battles they weren't real,

187
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,610
but they were a police,

188
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:46,550
enough approximation for
61 men to lose their lives.

189
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,210
However,

190
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,200
despite these losses,

191
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:51,780
the U s army gained valuable experience
and pattern staked his claim.

192
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,680
Do you arguably be the US army's
finest exponents of Ahmed [inaudible].

193
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,573
Oh,

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,813
okay.

195
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,170
On the 7th of December,

196
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,300
1941 Japan attacked to the
United States of America.

197
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,340
That's pal harbor.

198
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,360
Four days later,

199
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,310
Germany declared war on America.

200
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,520
As with that World War Two became they
truly global war with plans for a 1942

201
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,161
allies,

202
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,440
invasion of western Europe
having been shelved.

203
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,230
The high command instead
chose to strike it.

204
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,930
Hitler's vishing French
allies in North Africa.

205
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Three separate task forces were launched
with General George Patton at taking

206
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:36,801
command of 35,000 men of the Western
task force ceiling at the Casablanca from

207
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,090
Virginia.

208
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,110
It pass on that has any fears or doubts?

209
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,501
Well,

210
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,680
he certainly wasn't a showing
them as he wrote in his diary.

211
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,240
When I realize what I am,

212
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,230
I am amazed,

213
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,250
but on reflection,

214
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,810
who is as good as I am,

215
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,700
I know of no one I've ever had.

216
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:50,881
Lee.

217
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,050
He was fairly modest to the amphibious
landings of the 8th of November when

218
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:59,100
largely unopposed and despite some
fierce resistance as patterns men pushed

219
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,730
inlands.

220
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,430
The Vichy French signed an
armistice later that day,

221
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,900
far more formidable than the French.

222
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:04,291
However,

223
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,790
with Germany is a win.

224
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,960
Rommel and his Africa court
on the 14th of February,

225
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,790
1943 they attacked in force striking
a u s troops in years Atlas Mountains.

226
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,080
By the 20th of February,

227
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,910
the immediate crisis it was over,

228
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,870
but the Americans,

229
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,120
they'd been pushed back 50 miles.

230
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,440
Huge amounts of equipment had been
abandoned and 4,000 Americans including

231
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,101
pattern zones.

232
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:30,100
Son in law had been captured by the
Germans with morale on the floor and those

233
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:31,320
and how a sac to the commander,

234
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:35,280
he held responsible and placed all
American troops in Tunisia under patterns,

235
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:40,020
commands person immediately subjected
as men to an intensive drill routine and

236
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,930
strict disciplinary coat.

237
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,550
His methods weren't far
from university popular,

238
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,650
but they got results and within a month
pattern was on the offensive defeating

239
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,060
the formidable German 10th Panzer Division
at the Battle of El Guitar passing

240
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,560
rapidly build himself a
reputation in north Africa,

241
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,430
but it was here at the t began his
rivalry with Bernard Montgomery,

242
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,300
the commander of the British
Eighth Army while passing.

243
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,911
It was bold,

244
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,451
aggressive,

245
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:05,070
and often acted on gut instinct.

246
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,771
Montgomery.

247
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,680
It was by nature,

248
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,130
read far more cautious man.

249
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,680
You put great stock in
meticulous planning,

250
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,290
patterned believed Eisenhower
deferred to Montgomery,

251
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,940
far too often a feeling that was only
strengthens when the British commander was

252
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:20,540
given the go ahead to plan
the invasion of Sicily.

253
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,660
Okay.

254
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,140
The invasion of Sicily was to be a joint
operation conducted the British Eighth

255
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:40,141
Army led by Montgomery as the u s seventh
on the commanded blink George Pattern,

256
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,460
much to persons discussed
the Montgomery's plan place.

257
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:47,830
The main emphasis on the British
contingent and cast the Americans in the

258
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,970
supporting role.

259
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,290
This is what you get fumed pattern
when your commander in chief Eisenhower

260
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,200
ceases to be an American
hands becomes an ally.

261
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,061
The invasion force,

262
00:11:57,061 --> 00:12:00,400
it landed on the beaches of
Sicily on the 10th of July,

263
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,110
1943 by nice for the allies had put
80,000 men and 300 tanks or short.

264
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,230
The next day it patterned himself
came to inspect the beachhead,

265
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,970
wading in the through the surf,

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
even as artillery shells
exploded around the beach.

267
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,180
While it seemed became clear that the
Germans would not be able to hold Sicily.

268
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,290
They fought a fierce rear guard action
as they began to evacuated their army to

269
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,430
the Italian mainland's.

270
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,220
As Montgomery's army became
bogged down at pattern,

271
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:27,040
decided to take a loose
interpretation of his orders.

272
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,870
He was expected to support the British,

273
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:32,620
but I mean surely the best way to do
this would be to hit the Germans heart

274
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,101
pattern.

275
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:37,450
Dhruv the seventh army on his goal now
was to beat him Montgomery to the city of

276
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,340
[inaudible] in the north of the islands.

277
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,280
He was driven not just
by his personal ambition,

278
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,080
but by a desire to prove that the American
soldier was the best in the world.

279
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,670
The Sicily campaign was
fought at a blistering pace
in blazing heat casualties.

280
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,060
Well,

281
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,370
they were inevitable on August,

282
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,680
1943 paths and visited the
wounded at a field hospital.

283
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,250
When he discovered that
one of the patients was
physically unhurt but suffering

284
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,090
from shell shock,

285
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,480
he exploded with rage pattern.

286
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:06,730
It slaps to the unfortunate man dragged
in from the tent and kicked him in the

287
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:09,490
backside and then threatened
to shoot him for cowardice.

288
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,301
Unfortunately,

289
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:10,780
for pattern,

290
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,140
this extraordinary display had been
conducted under the noses of a number of

291
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,500
journalists patterned and it seemed
to realize had done anything wrong,

292
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,371
but striking.

293
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,010
A subordinate was a court martial offense.

294
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,940
Eisenhower ordered pattern to apologize
bags of the witnesses not to report on

295
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:28,720
the incidents and hoped that that would
be enough to protect his most dangerous

296
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:32,530
weapon in the war against the Nazis
spa pattern one is rest in Messina and

297
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,720
through the Nazis out
of Sicily is vicious.

298
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,670
Temper came back to bite him as word.

299
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:38,380
If his assaults leaked out in the press,

300
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,330
there was this or more
Eisenhower could do pattern.

301
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:44,350
He was removed from his commands and
with that it seemed as if his Korea,

302
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,303
it might be over

303
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,830
the invasion of Italy,

304
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,580
was a natural result of
the conquest of Sicily.

305
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,330
Patton,

306
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,950
who was ill suited to inactivity B could
only watch on in frustration of even

307
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,870
greater importance than
the campaign and this,

308
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:10,470
and he was the long awaited
invasion of western Europe.

309
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,910
This would take place in June of
1944 it was one of the most difficult

310
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,290
operations of the war.

311
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,460
There's pattern would have it,

312
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,920
no direct role to play in the invasion.

313
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,640
Instead though there was used as a
decoy given commands of an entirely

314
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:27,210
fictitious army intended to fool the
Germans into believing that a second

315
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,730
invasion force was preparing
to strike the ruse.

316
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,900
It totally worked.

317
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,090
The Germans never imagines that the
allies would leave their best offensive

318
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,340
general back in Britain.

319
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,370
While such a vote of the offensive
was being fought in France.

320
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,990
Okay,

321
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,360
awesome.

322
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,910
Greatest fear was that the war would
be before he could get back into it.

323
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,200
He needs tons of worried though.

324
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,710
While the success of the initial
allied invasion exceeded expectations,

325
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,000
the British and the Americans made
slow progress as they attempted to push

326
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,660
inland's.

327
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,620
It wasn't until the end of July for the
Americans finally punched the small hole

328
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,030
through the German lines.

329
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,160
Omar Bradley,

330
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,280
commander of the U s grounds forces knew
that this was the moment to get pattern

331
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,480
back into the frame.

332
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,530
Radley it regarded pattern as difficult
to control and predictable and vulgar,

333
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,120
but he recognized his talents pattern
was given commands of the newly formed

334
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,930
Third Army,

335
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,190
a Heidi mobile force equipped with plenty
of art that he was ordered to go back

336
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,460
and it's break through the German
lines pattern that quickly got to work,

337
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:34,640
squeezed his armored divisions through
the narrowest of gaps in the German

338
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,121
lines,

339
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:39,920
reform them on the other side and within
a matter of days is Third Army was

340
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,440
tearing through open
country and to Brittany.

341
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,340
The speed of patterns.

342
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,350
Advances often worry to superior.

343
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:46,670
Since he was a risk taker,

344
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,550
he rarely worried about the
danger of an attack to his flanks.

345
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,480
Hitler himself actually thought it
sniffed out and opportunity to exploit the

346
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:54,410
allied breakout.

347
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,550
He would launch a counterattack and
cutoff patterns Ahmed's spearheads.

348
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,280
Now this idea,

349
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,391
well,

350
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,860
it did have its merits in theory,

351
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,930
but the German army lacked the strength.

352
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,910
Do you execute the operation in practice?

353
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,950
It was instead the Germans,

354
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:09,920
he found themselves in danger of being
complete and the encircled at filets pass

355
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:13,730
and believed he was in a position to
slam the drawers of the trap shot.

356
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,320
Bradley a far more cautious,

357
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,150
commanded them Patton or did the
Third Army to halt our Jensen passing.

358
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,031
He was furious,

359
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:23,420
but he complied with the order even
though he suspected Bradley had been

360
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,860
influenced by Montgomery.

361
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:25,694
Yeah,

362
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,251
headless fails.

363
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:40,560
Counselor attack LEDs to the near collapse
of the German army in France without

364
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,081
a pattern.

365
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,360
It was freeze and launches
blitzkrieg assaults.

366
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,190
His philosophy was relentless attack
and unrelenting pressure that caps the

367
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:52,690
enemy constantly off balance and to
minimize the Third Army casualties pattern

368
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:54,250
argued that if he was properly back,

369
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:57,450
so you've got to cross the river Rhine
and a matter of weeks spots pass and

370
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,190
found himself at once again in
competition with Montgomery,

371
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,450
as each man is empty,

372
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:05,710
do you secure enough supplies to keep
their army moving as passing complains,

373
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,170
my man can eat their belts,

374
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,451
spares.

375
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,280
My tanks have got to have gas.

376
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,970
Although there were such disagreements
amongst the leading ally generals,

377
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,930
they were United in the belief that
Hitler's armies were all but beaten.

378
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,160
Germany's Phurah.

379
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:18,700
However,

380
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,930
had one last surprise in
store on the 16th of December,

381
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:27,220
1944 the Germans launched a vast counter
attack aimed at a thinly held section

382
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:28,900
of the American lines at our den.

383
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,160
This was the beginning of the battle that
we had become famous as the battle of

384
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:33,820
the bulge,

385
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,140
the at southern and furious.

386
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,400
The soul's badly rattles,

387
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,540
most allied commodities that's and
recognized once that Hitler had made a

388
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,040
serious strategic error.

389
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,710
Let the sons of bitches
go all the way to Paris.

390
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:45,940
If they like your job's,

391
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,550
then we can really cut
them off and shoot them up.

392
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,500
Eisenhower to senior commanders do an
emergency conference where he asked how

393
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,600
long it would take a pattern.

394
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,660
Do you divert his third
army to the Adana pattern?

395
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,030
Told him he could have three
divisions there within 48 hours.

396
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,620
This seemingly fantastical claim was
matched with a mixture of laughter.

397
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,070
Then disbelieving stairs,

398
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,090
but pattern.

399
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,991
He was in tiny,

400
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,250
serious hit anticipated Eisenhower's
request and just staff were already making

401
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,001
preparations.

402
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,690
Do you disengage the part of the third
army in order to wheel it around,

403
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,690
they would then race to the
rescue along narrow icy roads.

404
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,950
The Battle of the bulge gave
of the allied high commands,

405
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,230
a shock lets as pattern had predicted
is accomplished nothing and cost.

406
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,120
Hitler has lost reserves now.

407
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:31,020
The River Rhine was the last significant
obstacles that the western allies have

408
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:31,620
to tackle.

409
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,160
The main crossing was
to be launched Irvine,

410
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,781
Montgomery.

411
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,260
Mattie spent two months planning
every last detail of the operation,

412
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,150
which calls for an airborne assault,

413
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,920
a huge artillery bombardments and even
the assistance of specialized the US navy

414
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,550
vessels.

415
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,730
Well Gum Murray's crossing was launched
on the 23rd of March by which time

416
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,550
pattern had already stolen his thumbs up,

417
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,400
like quietly sneaking a division
across under the cover of darkness and

418
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,440
establishing a bridgehead
on the other side.

419
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,770
He phones Bradley to let him know
what he'd done but don't tell anyone.

420
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,410
He said because the crowds
haven't realized yet

421
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,740
with its feeds of Germany and tried and
failed to secure a posting to the Far

422
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,900
East in order to play a part
in the war against Japan.

423
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,620
Instead,

424
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,790
he was appointed as
governor of the Varian,

425
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,860
the political posts.

426
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,430
Twitchy was not well suited.

427
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,980
He fell out with the Russians,

428
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,880
refused to remove Nazi personnel from
key administrative positions on the basis

429
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:31,980
that there was nobody else
qualified to do the job,

430
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,540
and it's got to tricks by a reporter
into agreeing that Nazis joins the party

431
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,350
and more or less the same way as
Americans became Democrats or Republicans

432
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:40,861
patterns,

433
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:44,250
political abilities didn't really
compare to his military abilities.

434
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,670
Angie,

435
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,130
once again succeeded
in outraging the press.

436
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,440
His subsequent apology
was deemed insufficient.

437
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:49,631
Tends.

438
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,960
He was removed from his
post for the second time,

439
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,250
but at this point,

440
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,540
although he didn't know it,

441
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,190
he had only a few months left to live
on December the ninth 1945 pattern was

442
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:03,270
being driven towards a hunting expedition
when the vehicle he was traveling in

443
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:06,000
was struck by a truck traveling
in the opposite direction.

444
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,260
Nobody else was hurt.

445
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,850
That's passing,

446
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,530
was paralyzed from the neck
down the injured general.

447
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:13,140
He was rushed to hospital
where he died 11 days later,

448
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,700
he was buried in Europe alongside the
fallen soldiers who was beloved Third Army

449
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,220
Patton.

450
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,680
It always wanted to die in battle,

451
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,370
but instead he lost his life as the
result of a low speed collision in

452
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:24,204
peacetime.

453
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,251
Now,

454
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:33,940
most everybody accepts the official
version of patterns demise and it has been

455
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,780
suggested the person may have
been assassinated by the Russians,

456
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,270
possibly even in collusion
with the u s government.

457
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,960
This would have been as a result of his
outspoken opposition to the Soviet Union

458
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,800
when he died,

459
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,910
he was 60 years old,

460
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,350
so I really hope you enjoyed that video.
