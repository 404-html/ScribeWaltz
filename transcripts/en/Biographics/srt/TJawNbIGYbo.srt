00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,220
Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as one of
the greatest scientists who ever lived.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,450
His breakthrough idea about motion
influenced every area of physics,

7
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:29,090
allowing other great thinkers
to stand on his shoulders,

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,900
yet news and was also a man at
odds with his public perception,

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,250
a secret our chemist and a heretic
who risked his life to write about the

10
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:40,340
feelings of the Anglican
Church in today's biographics.

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,910
We're uncovering the truth
about the real Isaac Newton.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,040
Hm Isaac Newton

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,170
was born on January the fourth
1643 and will's thought,

14
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:58,480
but by cost or worth the small town in
the country of Lincoln, Sharon England's,

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,350
he was a premature baby who was so small
that his mother said that he would have

16
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:04,930
fit inside a quarter
mark with room to spare.

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,100
The doctor who delivered him didn't
think that he'd survive his first week.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,050
Newton's father who was also named Isaac,

19
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,450
had died three months
before the child was born.

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,140
He had been a successful farmer and
his wife Hannah was left a financially

21
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:21,070
comfortable widow for the next three
years. She raised young Isaac alone.

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,330
Then in 1646 she remarried to
becoming Mrs Barnabas Smith.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,210
The relationship between young eyes,
I could just step father.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,300
It was a difficult one and the boys
spends lots of time in the care of his

25
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,990
grandmother, Hannah and Barnabas went
on. So you have three children together.

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,000
Benjamin,
Mary and Hannah.

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,570
Isaac seems to have gotten on well
with his half siblings though his

28
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:44,770
relationship with his mother
was tempestuous when he
was 19 Isaac wrote a list

29
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,320
of sins for which he wanted to repent.

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,190
One of them was threatening to burn
down his family home with his mother and

31
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:54,760
stepfather and cite it Isaac and
did a village school sporadically,

32
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:58,330
but we didn't begin as formal schooling
until the age of 12 when he enrolled at

33
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:58,991
King's school.

34
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:02,650
Then grounds and England's initially he
showed little interest in his studies

35
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:06,040
and it's performed poorly in all
subjects. However, all of a sergeant,

36
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,400
he had something of an attitude change
and he decided to apply himself more

37
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,730
seriously.
When he was 17 Isaac stepfather died.

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,130
There's another looking to
a oldest sons potential.

39
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:18,130
As the family breadwinner attempted
to make a farmer out of him.

40
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:21,610
This Isaac had no intention
of becoming a farmer. In fact,

41
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,540
he detested the very thought of
spending his life out in the fields.

42
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,310
Unfortunately,
after a few months,

43
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:30,400
that master at King's school
interceded on Isaac's behalf,

44
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:34,360
convincing Anna it was
best suited back with them.

45
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,220
Isaac had been bullied by another students
chose to response by hour to doing

46
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,890
the bully and his cronies.
Academically,

47
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,640
Isaac achieved outstanding
academic results.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,150
He was the top performing students of
1660 displaying and amazing aptitude for

49
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,140
all subjects.

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,120
In June of 1661 Isaac began studying at
Trinity College at Cambridge University

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,340
in order to pay for his studies.

52
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,300
He worked out one side of his study hours
serving meals and running errands for

53
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,134
his professors.

54
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,910
The 18 year olds it enter trinity with
the goal of becoming a minister of the

55
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,571
Church of England's.
However,

56
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,570
at some point within that first
year he changed direction.

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,680
It is unclear why he decided not
to pursue a life in the church,

58
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:25,030
but from his later writings it was clear
that he was forming beliefs about gone

59
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,900
the work rather at odds with the
doctrine of the Anglican church.

60
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,890
The foundation of the education
that Newton was receiving
at Trinity College was

61
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:37,090
based on the teachings of Aristotle.
He was fascinated with these ideas.

62
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,660
This objects,
it's many of the concepts sweat,

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,670
not based on evidence but merely on the
great philosophers assumptions and his

64
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:49,690
ideas. Using the became increasingly
focused on the natural sciences as well as

65
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,320
philosophy.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,400
He studied the works of such original
thinkers as day car Kaplow and Galileo

67
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,510
because the establishment have
not accepted the scientific
findings of these men.

68
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,230
Isaac did a lot of his study outside
of the classroom using an exorbitant

69
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,450
scientific ideas from
wherever you could get them.

70
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,120
So long as he was able
to test and prove them,

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,590
he would take these ideas on board and
then debate them with his professors and

72
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,550
fellow students.

73
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,290
In 1662 Newton filled the
pages of a notebook with a
list of 45 things he wanted

74
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,710
to study. They came under the
general heading of physics,

75
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,170
but unlike everyone else
who had gone before him,

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,250
nuisance didn't just pose the questions.
He also set out to answer them.

77
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,330
He began to divide these experiments in
order to find the answers that he was

78
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,164
looking for.

79
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,170
The following year,
however,

80
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,950
Newton's the focus was pulled away from
his list of physics based questions.

81
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,530
He became fascinated with the
works of rainy day Carson.

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,530
This led him to an in
depth study of mathematics.

83
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,880
They call it applied to the
Arabic discipline of Algebra
two geometry and called

84
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,410
it Algebraic geometry.

85
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,000
Using graduated from Trinity College in
August of 1665 he did not receive the

86
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,370
stellar grades that his
talents mirrors said,

87
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:04,700
which was probably due to the fact
that he spent so much time on his own

88
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:08,430
personal studies. At this time, all
of Europe, it was being ravaged.

89
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:13,430
The bonding the bubonic plague in London,
one in every four people died.

90
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,390
Colleges were closed down in an attempt
to control the spread of the disease.

91
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,450
This bespoke ones,
Newton's continued formal education,

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,720
but he made great use of the
time for the next two years.

93
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:26,480
Isaac focused on his personal
studies from his family.

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,200
Home is the main areas of study where
calculus, lunar motion, and optics.

95
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,950
He know at the time to mull over all of
the knowledge that he had accumulated at

96
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:36,140
Cambridge.
It's relate this to the world around him.

97
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,610
This led them to more questions.

98
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:41,900
Three of the most fundamental of which
were why do things always fall down?

99
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,760
Why doesn't the moon fall to earth
and why the planets stay in orbit?

100
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,570
Newton was convinced the mathematics
would lead to the answers to these

101
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,240
questions.
He developed a new form of maths,

102
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:56,750
which he called flux is
the basis of modern day.

103
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,050
He knows you wrote about this
time in his life. At this time,

104
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,320
I was in the prime of my age of invention,
men's minded,

105
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,760
mathematics and philosophy.

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,880
More than anytime since using re-sentence
Duke Cambridge in the spring of 1667

107
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,400
he had developed into a role
the acuity of 23 year old man.

108
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,960
He was a loner with no friends.

109
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:19,190
He was content to spend hours
on ends just with his thoughts.

110
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,730
Many people dismissed him as just
being an absent minded recluse,

111
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,330
none of his contemporaries that any
idea that he was grappling with an

112
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,860
understanding of punditry motion.

113
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,520
He took up a position as a fellow
of the college and held a number of

114
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,500
prestigious positions
over the coming years.

115
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,380
In 1669 Isaac published his first work,

116
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,960
which was called analysis
by infinite series.

117
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,160
It was an investigation of cubic equations
and comes in three dimensions and was

118
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,880
well received and the wider scientific
community. As a fellow of Cambridge,

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,780
Newton was expected to become an
ordained priest in the Anglican church,

120
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,100
but his opposition to the belief in the
Trinity Doctrine held him back when he

121
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,760
was appointed as Lucchese and professor
of mathematics at the college officials

122
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,320
pressed for his ordained ship.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,470
He managed to pull it off the requirements
and he received the promotion.

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,670
Now Age 27 years in hell is one of
the most prestigious positions in the

125
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,980
mathematical world.
As an occasion professor,

126
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,670
he was required to lecture on mathematics
and place copies of his moods in the

127
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,360
university library, a requirement's,
which he rarely complied with.

128
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,390
He began lecturing on the subject of
optics with his notes forming the basis of

129
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,660
his book optics.

130
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,590
His work on optics led Newton to
focus on improving the working of the

131
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:34,820
refracting telescope.

132
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,630
He was grappling with the problem of how
to get the different colors of light to

133
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:41,330
come into focus at the
same spot on the lens.

134
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,110
He failed to solve this issue and so
turned his attention to the reflecting

135
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:49,940
telescope. In 1668 Newton produced the
first working reflective telescope,

136
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:53,000
a building on the work of Scottish
mathematician, James Gregory.

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,320
He used his telescope to look into the
night sky where he was able to observe

138
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,480
the four means of the planet Jupiter.

139
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,253
Hmm.

140
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,040
In 1671 using was nominated as a member
of the British Royal Society to support

141
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,040
this proposed candidacy.
He wrote a letter on the nature of light,

142
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,290
which was red at the
society's next meeting.

143
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,370
It calls mixed reactions with some
praising his observation and others

144
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:25,260
vehemently opposed to it
using was admitted to the
Royal Society in 1672 mocking

145
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:28,050
his entry into the legitimate
scientific community.

146
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,540
Up until then he had done
his work in bice elation,

147
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,770
but now he was rubbing shoulders with the
most prominent scientists in the world.

148
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,910
Isaac immediately came to loggerheads
with most of the respected members of the

149
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,960
royal society. Robert Hook was the
curator of experiments for the society.

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,860
Unlike the quiet, reserved nusend
hook was loud and outgoing.

151
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,290
He objected to Newton's writings
on the nature of lights,

152
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,890
which challenged the conventional
wisdom over a period of four years,

153
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:56,070
Hook road 10 published
objections to Newton's ideas,

154
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,780
each of which were counted by Isaac.

155
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,760
Use it in the heat of
the constant quarreling,

156
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,880
which was a part and parcel of
being a member of the royal society.

157
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,050
And it's after 15 months he
quit the organization, the
secretary of the society,

158
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:07,950
Henry Oldenburg,

159
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,580
pleaded with him to stay assuring
him that he was greatly respected.

160
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,390
But Newton stayed away from the
society for the next two years.

161
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,043
Okay.

162
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,810
By 1675 newtons, refusal to take the
priesthood was becoming a serious problem.

163
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,380
There was becoming a talking points
which was proving embarrassing to the

164
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:33,230
college with it looking as if
he would lose his position.

165
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:37,190
He turned to his men Zuarin's, former
Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow for help.

166
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,240
Barry suggested that he rides a King
Charles the second and request a special

167
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:45,410
dispensation allowing him to continue
in his position without entering the

168
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:46,080
priesthood.

169
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,950
Using was generally dissatisfied with
the way that the Anglican church or

170
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,910
devolved is maintained or any of the
trappings of the Catholic Church,

171
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,960
which he objected to.

172
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,020
But his biggest problem was with
the doctrine of the trinity.

173
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,110
He could not accept that God and Jesus
will one in March of 1675 and years and

174
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,380
traveled to London to file for a special
dispensation. So it's really fun.

175
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:08,750
Surprise. It was granted
without question. In fact,

176
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:12,640
the king removed the priesthood
requirements for all future new occasion

177
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:16,640
professorships in November of 60 90 a
bright comments appeared over the skies in

178
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:19,760
England. It was tracks and commented
on by the leading scientists,

179
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:23,780
including Newton and a new role
society member named Edmund Halley.

180
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,130
In 1684 the two men got
together to discuss the shape
of the orbits of planets.

181
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,450
Haney was impressed with Newton's ideas
and persuaded him to present his works

182
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:35,060
in written form to the royal society.
Now,

183
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:36,980
just before we get into
the rest of Newton's life,

184
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,850
I do want to take a moment to thank the
people who make this video possible and

185
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,710
not be brilliant.
And I know these mid role ads,

186
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:45,650
they're not great for the story here,
but these videos are long,

187
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:48,950
so I hope you appreciate it. I need to
have sponsors to make them possible.

188
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,980
They're pretty expensive and time
consuming to prick juice. Now,

189
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:55,670
brilliance are a learning platform which
teaches three something called active

190
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,820
learning. I like biographies, which are
a nice way to learn about people's lives,

191
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:01,610
like a Newton. Learning about
science, it's a little bit trickier.

192
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,330
I don't know if you've ever had to sit
down with a science textbook. I have.

193
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,460
And you know this shore a lot
of moments where it's like, Huh,

194
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,640
I didn't really understand
what is going on.

195
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:14,150
And then you read it again and you still
don't get it. This is passive learning.

196
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,310
It's no a brilliance is about brilliance,

197
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,580
have active learning and they give
you something super short to read.

198
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,430
It's really easy and then you can
immediately apply that to a problem.

199
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,190
You just rinse and repeat that and
suddenly you're understanding all sorts of

200
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:26,480
stuff that you didn't think you would be.

201
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,840
I've used brilliance and I think you
should go try it out just to see how

202
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:34,280
fascinating it is that a complex
subject can be grasped quite so easily.

203
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,410
Obviously with this
biography about Newton,

204
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:39,620
they've got lots of stuff
related to what he was up to you.

205
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,700
So nice tie in that you could spoil
biographics by going to brilliant.org

206
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,760
forward slash buyer graphics.
And let's get back to Newton

207
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,650
for the next 18 months.
Newton was consumed with the
rising of his masterwork,

208
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:00,070
which he called Principia Mathematica.
He was so absorbed with it.

209
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:03,940
So there's the often neglected to eat
or sleep and there's three volume work.

210
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:06,880
He brought together the
results of 20 years of study,

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,130
observation and thinking about nature.

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,730
He began by laying out a
series of definitions that
underpinned his thoughts on

213
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,690
the natural world. These definitions
for such things as inertia matter,

214
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,310
mass and momentum. They still stand
today with his basis established.

215
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,500
He then laid out his three laws of motion,

216
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,450
the law of inertia and north acceleration
and the law of action and reaction

217
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,090
these ins and led to his
most groundbreaking idea,

218
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,660
the law of universal gravitation,
the law of gravitation.

219
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,140
It flew in the face of Aristotle's
2000 year old teaching that the earth

220
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,820
operates under one set of rules while
the sun, the moon, planets and stars,

221
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:46,330
and they follow different rules according
to news and there was one law that

222
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,920
governs the motion of everything in the
universe. The Principia was presented,

223
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:55,570
the Royal Society in 60 86 roboto can
immediately accused Newton of plagiarizing

224
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:59,020
his ideas. Despite this, the volume, it
was well received when it was published.

225
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,660
A year later,
it became an instant masterpiece.

226
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,980
The lower of universal gravitation
was accepted as the breakthrough that

227
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:10,300
explained everything from the motion of
the planets to the tones of the seat.

228
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,450
Despite the popular reaction
to Principia Newton's ideas,

229
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,990
they would not be taught in
universities for another 50 years

230
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,640
when he was a students at Cambridge.

231
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,040
And using that first come
into contact with Alchemy,

232
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,210
this Uda signs had its origins in
the works of Aristotle who taught.

233
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,960
So that all matter was composed
of four basic elements, earth,

234
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,340
fire and water. By adjusting the
proportions of any of these components,

235
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:43,030
it was believed that one thing could
be turned into another. Aristotle.

236
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,140
Also towards that each of the elements
was connected to a human emotion or a

237
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:49,930
characteristic. Newsland was
fascinated with these concepts,

238
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:53,860
even though they were completely at odds
with the rational evidence based way

239
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,460
that he synthesize to scientific
ideas from that time owned would see,

240
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,480
let us sort of double life where he
portrayed himself as the ultimate logical

241
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:05,170
thinker while pursuing Unorthodox
alchemist experiments, uh,

242
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:07,540
away from prying eyes.
At the same time,

243
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,770
he also developed a number of religious
views that were decidedly outside of the

244
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:12,430
mainstream.

245
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,430
Starting in 1669 Newton
built up an extensive library
of alchemy related books.

246
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,270
He was obsessed with finding universal
truth and so alchemy as a means of doing

247
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,870
so. He wrote thousands of
words of notes on the sub.

248
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,020
Jackson's conducted hundreds of
experiments has inflammation.

249
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,470
It was eventually condensed
into a book which equals Clavis.

250
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,240
New Zealand has a deep and
abiding interest in religion.

251
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,720
Over the course of his life. He wrote
more than a million words on the subjects,

252
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:48,690
but very few of them were actually
published during his lifetime.

253
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,550
Through his studies of the Hebrew language
and careful study of the scriptures,

254
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:56,330
he became convinced that
modern Christianity was not
following the model that

255
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,650
had been set out by Jesus.

256
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,420
You didn't fundamentally disagreed with
the doctrine of the holy trinity at the

257
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:02,811
time.

258
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:07,811
This was a act of heresy punishable by
imprisonment or even worse by writing

259
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,730
about it.
Even if his work was unpublished,

260
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,720
he was putting his very life at risk
to important works of scriptural

261
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,640
interpretation that were
published in the century.

262
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:20,480
After his death were observations on the
prophecies of Daniel and the apocalypse

263
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,720
of some John and the chronology
of Angel and kingdoms.

264
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:28,310
Amended Knudsen was fascinated
with Solomon's temple
believing that the building

265
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:33,311
was a paradigm for the universe and a
pattern for the future of the human race.

266
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,770
It was his belief that the architecture
of the temple health secrets do

267
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,540
uncovering the mysteries of the universe
and reveals a future Bible prophecy

268
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,540
from his. He gave predictions now
the ends of the Catholic Church.

269
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:49,400
The return of Christ wins
the Day of Judgment in 1687
using became involved in a

270
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,670
conflict between King James the
second and Cambridge University.

271
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,840
The Benedictine monk has
requested a receipt of a
master's degree without having

272
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:59,660
to swear an oath of allegiance
to the Anglican Church.

273
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
The monk appealed to the king,

274
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,550
issued a mandate stating that the
university must admit the man without

275
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:05,480
requiring the oath.

276
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,050
Newton came out on behalf
of the university and with
soon appointed to represent

277
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,171
them.

278
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:12,710
At the Commission hearing at Westminster
is arguments proved persuasive and the

279
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,690
monk was not admitted to the university

280
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,390
in January,

281
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,510
1699 using was elected to public
office when he became the university's

282
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,280
representative in the convention.

283
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,730
Parliaments with his new position
came a change in personality.

284
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,900
You transformed from an introverted
retiring academic to a friendlier,

285
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,760
more outgoing public servants.

286
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,410
In 1690 newtons suffers a
period of depression and
mental exhaustion apparently

287
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,630
compounded by a dose of influenza.

288
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,620
He recovered and Spence the 60
nineties focused on the moon's orbit.

289
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,030
His work required the obtain astronomical
readings from the first astronomer,

290
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:55,660
Royal John farmstead.
That's the two men they did not get on.

291
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,280
They quarreled from the very start with
the relationship eventually completely

292
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,123
breaking down.

293
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,970
This meant that Newton was unable to
complete his investigation into lunar

294
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:08,380
cycles. In 1696 newtons, salty, higher
paying job in the public service.

295
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,380
He was awarded the position
of warden of the royal mint.

296
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,360
This drop required to move to London,

297
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:15,940
which is where he actually
lived until his death.

298
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,690
He oversaw the recoiling of
old silver and gold coins.

299
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,530
He also standardize the
weights and composition of
coins so that he was able to

300
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,500
bring British coinage.
A much greater degree of accuracy.

301
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:28,600
Then was seven known before
three years into the job.

302
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,960
He was promoted to master
of the meds the draw,

303
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,360
which she held until his death
paid around 1500 pounds a year,

304
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,100
which was a huge amount for the times
in 1703 mucin now the most famous

305
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:42,880
scientist in the land to send it to
the presidency of the royal society.

306
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,560
He held this position until his death
in 1,705 he received a knighthood from

307
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:48,550
Queen Anne.
However,

308
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:52,650
his acclaim among the scientific community
was strange with an ongoing dispute

309
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,810
with gem and polymath Godfrey live in.

310
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:58,320
It's over which of them should get the
credit for the invention of calculus.

311
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,110
Although New Zealand was the first
to develop the basic concepts,

312
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,140
live minutes published his
work on Calculus before Newton.

313
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,320
The issue divided the leading
scientists of the time.

314
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,343
Yeah.

315
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,250
During the last few decades of his life
and you didn't spend a great deal of

316
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:19,550
time revising his most famous
work Principia Mathematica.

317
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,660
A second edition was published in 1713
with a third and final version appearing

318
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:28,520
in 70 26 he also indulged a passion for
Biblical studies spending days on end

319
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,400
compiling notes on the history
of the ancient Hebrews.

320
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,620
It is clear that Newton was keen to
insure his legacy lived on beyond this

321
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,650
physical years.

322
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,220
He sat for a number of portraits and
sculptures were cost of him still vote.

323
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:43,880
He professed an outward appearance of
humility, making the following statement.

324
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,360
I do not know what's I may appear
to the world, but to myself,

325
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:52,100
I seem to have been only
like a boy playing on the
seashore and diverting myself

326
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:56,870
in now and then finding a smoother paddle,
Laurie, prettier shell and ordinary.

327
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:01,040
Whilst the Great Ocean of truth
lay all undiscovered before me.

328
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,530
The last years of Newton's
life was spent with his niece,

329
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:07,400
Kathryn Barton conduit and her husband's
in his seventies he began to suffer

330
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:10,910
from breathing problems prompting and
moved from London to Kensington where the

331
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:15,680
I was fresher in 1725 at the age of 82
he was confined to his beds with severe

332
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:16,490
lung problems.

333
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,030
Coughing fits were constant since he
suffered from an uncontrolled bladder.

334
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,330
By early 1727 he seemed to
have recovered some wash.

335
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,540
He actually felt good enough to preside
over the Royal Society Meeting on

336
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:31,190
February the 28th but that efforts, it was
too much for him. Upon his return home,

337
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:35,240
he was again confined to bed and now
early March is doctors diagnosed kidney

338
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,240
stone and his condition steadily
worsens throughout that month.

339
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,760
Dee passed away in the
early hours of March,

340
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:45,761
the 31st 1727 using was awarded the great
honor of being buried at Westminster

341
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,120
Abbey.

342
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,170
His funeral service was the
most extravagant ever held
in England for a natural

343
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:54,350
philosopher. So already hope you
