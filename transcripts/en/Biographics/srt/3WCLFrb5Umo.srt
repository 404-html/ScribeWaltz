1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,020
He's the dentist son who grew up to
become the world's youngest billionaire.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,250
In the mid two thousands,

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:08,880
mark Zuckerberg created a website
that defines a generational website.

4
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,430
You almost certainly use yourself.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,740
The bad wolf is facebook today.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,150
It dominates the Internet.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,190
It has more active users
than the populations of China
and India combined at the

8
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,024
time of writing.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,000
It's worth around half a trillion dollars.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,960
It's also at the center of some massive
control disease that have dominated the

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,680
headlines.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,130
Yup.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,820
How much to most of us know about
the man behind the business?

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,930
Maybe you've seen the movie,

15
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:34,770
the social network,

16
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,660
which reimagines Mark Zuckerberg is a
kind of Lex luthor of the internet using

17
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,970
his genius to crush his enemies.

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,400
This elements of truth to that to be sure,

19
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:47,190
but the real mark Zuckerberg
is far more interesting,

20
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:50,310
far more nuanced and far
more tragically flawed.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,030
Rich,

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,863
brilliant,

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,733
idealistic.

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,280
This is the story of how one
privileged kid from small town,

25
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,860
New York created a digital empire.

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,330
I really need to see all his good
intentions collapsed to dust.

27
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,680
If you were living among the clapboard
houses and leafy streets of dobbs ferry,

28
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,180
New York in the mid nineties,

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,770
they would have been one neighborhood
kid who you were sure was going to go far

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,080
and that would've been mocked soccer bag,

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,420
born in nearby white
plains on May the 14th,

32
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:33,090
1984 young mark was a veritable prodigy,

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
taught Atari basic programming
language as a child by age 12.

34
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,210
He was creating sprawling
games from his friends.

35
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,490
Childhood drawings lies mid teens,

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,210
Middleton,

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,900
early messaging app called Zach and after
this allowed the family to communicate

38
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,050
with his dad's dentistry
business online in real time.

39
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,230
When mark ended up transferring to
these super prestigious Phillips Exeter

40
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,140
Academy for Graduate Computing Course,

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,140
no one was in the least bit surprised
this Aka bags had always been a family of

42
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,200
brain boxes that Edward
was a dentist and mum,

43
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,530
Karen was a psychiatrist and the family
always encouraged learning in their four

44
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:08,310
children.

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,143
But mark,

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,350
he was something else,

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,071
a polyglot.

48
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,020
It taught himself how to speak French,

49
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,760
Hebrew that in an ancient Greek,

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,440
he was captain of the fencing team.

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,050
He devoured classic literature
along with the friends,

52
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:19,980
Adams Angelou.

53
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:24,030
It even programmed a media player so
advanced that it sparked a bidding war

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,370
between Microsoft and AOL.

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,280
In short,

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,220
mark was one of those privileged kids
you can tell are destined to forever roll

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,470
doubles sixes in the game of life.

58
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,650
He had the talent to go far and he had
the competitive drive to on a form around

59
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:40,350
this time.

60
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,010
He actually listed defeating
Nemeses as his hobby.

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,360
So when this woman begins,

62
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,490
lends into place at Harvard in 2002,

63
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,640
it was just another step on that great
long staircase of privilege that led to

64
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:55,190
the heaven of a high flying job and day.

65
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,040
I'm in the Hamptons only
this particular staircase.

66
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,970
It came with a stumbling block.

67
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,320
This was one that would initially trip
19 year old mark before accidentally

68
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,610
showing him the how decline far higher
than it ever dreams that I'm of that

69
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,444
block.

70
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,690
Well,

71
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,680
that was loneliness.

72
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,600
So here's the thing
about going to Harvard.

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,980
As a small town genius,

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,850
you'll suddenly surrounded by other
geniuses for the first time in your life,

75
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:23,200
and some of these geniuses might be so
clever that you start to look a little

76
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,870
less special and just a bit more ordinary.

77
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,040
In the 2008 profile rollingstone claims
that this was exactly what happens.

78
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,520
Mark Zuckerberg isolated among
so many other Harvard brainiacs,

79
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:38,350
he retreated into programming and Ben's
ending his social life for an online

80
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,150
world where he could still shine.

81
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,540
He created a popular site called
course match for his fellow students,

82
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,120
which gave them an insight
into what made people tick,

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,290
but course match.

84
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,760
It wasn't the work of a genius.

85
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,080
It didn't even make him stand out from
the crowd as he so desperately craved.

86
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,800
No,

87
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,330
he would have to wait until his sophomore
year to do that because that was when

88
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:03,331
he created the little something known as
facemash and excluded Harvard society.

89
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,360
In October 2003,

90
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,340
Mark Zuckerberg sat in his dorm room,

91
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,310
drunk and alone and
consumer by depression.

92
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,690
It just been jilted by one,

93
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,240
Jessica,

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,300
and like every young man,

95
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:22,140
unlucky in love,

96
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:26,820
he turned to alcohol to Numb the pain
of existence as a morosely blogged about

97
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,350
the bitch who had betrayed him.

98
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,100
Nineteen year old Zuckerberg began
sneaking through Kirkland dorms,

99
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:32,730
facebook.

100
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,510
That's Harvard Lingo for the online photo
directories of students that each dorm

101
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:41,511
keeps his ego winded soccer bag that has
negative thoughts flow into his blog.

102
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,400
Some of these people have pretty
horrendous facebook picks.

103
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,090
He wrote,

104
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,340
I almost want to put some of these faces
next to pictures of farm animals and

105
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,380
debit people vote on,

106
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,790
which is more attractive.

107
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,890
The more alcoholics,

108
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,800
acrobatic consumers,

109
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,930
the more he began to
take the idea seriously.

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,550
Maybe not with a farm animals,

111
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:01,551
but why not put up two
pictures of students and have
other students vote on who

112
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:02,604
is the hottest.

113
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,500
Before long Zuckerberg was thinking of.

114
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:08,880
His idea is more than just
a way of lashing out at a
world that it wounded him.

115
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,190
It would be an epic prank,

116
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:16,191
one that would no doubt go down in
Harvard history by the early morning hit

117
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,720
successfully hacked all of
Harvard's dorm directories,

118
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,640
scraping away private to use a day runs.

119
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,140
Blogging about is praying every step of
the way before the sun rose facemash.

120
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,270
It was live in no time at all.

121
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:32,271
Four hundred and 50 people had viewed
the site 22,000 times years later.

122
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,720
The 2010 movie,

123
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:37,710
the social network would suggest
facebook itself grew out of facemash,

124
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,210
which isn't quite true,

125
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,990
but facemash does remain key
to understanding soccer bag,

126
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,170
the scale and speed of the positive
response to his prank site.

127
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,720
It opened his eyes as he would later say,

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,600
we have a lot more voyeuristic
than I would have thought.

129
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a revelation he would assume
leverage into huge business success.

130
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,290
No,

131
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,080
the one event was guaranteed
that cold October night,

132
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,400
facemash was only live for a few hours
before Harvard shut it down and hit

133
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,580
Zuckerberg with the mother
of all disciplinary actions.

134
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,290
He could be suspended or expelled,

135
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,630
and then what would his
mom and his dad think?

136
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,221
Yes.

137
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,970
For all of the stress
that it caused him good,

138
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,180
that came out of the facemash debacle,

139
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,580
having gained something invaluable,

140
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,750
he was special again.

141
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,670
He was no longer a nobody.

142
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,650
He was a computer genius and to pranks
to hero Zaka bug was even able to

143
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,370
leverage his new notoriety and to a
date with a medical students called

144
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:33,380
Priscilla Chan and trust me,

145
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
that is a name you are going
to be hearing again and again.

146
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,240
On November the 19th,

147
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,460
2003 Harvard's disciplinary board.

148
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,320
It's dropped its privacy violation,

149
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,580
charges against Zaka back the prank stuff,

150
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,480
but water a bottle of champagne and
cracked it open with his room is to

151
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:48,230
celebrate.

152
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,063
Finally,

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,990
you had a place in the world again,

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,200
all through 2003.

155
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:02,110
Harvard had been a campus
that was buzzing with ideas.

156
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,970
These were the heady days of web.

157
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:07,870
Two point zero and social technologies
were clearly going to be the next big

158
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:08,410
thing.

159
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,840
All they needed was for
someone to harness them,

160
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,890
someone with the brains and the talent
to pull technology and all human desire

161
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,370
to connect into the first
great social website.

162
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Someone like Divya Narendra and some
brilliant New York kid of Indian descent,

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,250
Narendra was in his junior year at
Harvard when he had a brainwave.

164
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,360
Imagine if you could take Harvard's many
facebooks and combine them all into a

165
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,230
single site.

166
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,730
It would have a social section,

167
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:34,840
the dating section,

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,200
and it would combine all the advantages
of real life interaction with the

169
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,970
advantages of the facebooks.

170
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,510
The name,

171
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,220
foot Narendra is John's online.

172
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,054
Facebook.

173
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,291
Well,

174
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,820
last was Harvard connection.

175
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,830
Bloody Narendra was not an ad mat still.

176
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,770
He managed in April to
rope into identical twins,

177
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,780
Tyler and Cameron Winkle Voss.

178
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,520
They were going to act as his money man,

179
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,220
his team in place and render it now.

180
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,680
Just needed to compute a guy to write
the code and pull everything together.

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,480
It was at this point that the ambitious
young entrepreneur about facemash in

182
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:07,060
November of 2003 and a
render and the winco bosses.

183
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:09,860
They contacted the now notorious
because look good bags.

184
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,620
You asked if he would
help them in that project,

185
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,940
so he jumped at the chance emails from
the time that they should release the

186
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:16,870
full of positivity.

187
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,170
He told them it would take 10 hours
and that he wouldn't be finished soon.

188
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,700
Narendra and his cohorts,

189
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,500
they rub their hands with glee,

190
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,930
would only be a matter of time before
they will all filthy rich as November

191
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,230
ticked over into December.

192
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:31,930
Zuckerberg abandoned his
work on Harvard connection.

193
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,590
It's still though.

194
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,870
He promised new renderer that
it would be finished soon,

195
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,750
but he began to start
work and his own project.

196
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,970
This new project was a harvard connection,

197
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:44,350
but without all the extra crap it would
be one based on psychological insights

198
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,390
from facemash on January the 11th,

199
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,224
2004.

200
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,310
Look at the quantity registered the new
site with his web provider and with that

201
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,180
the facebook Dashcam appeared and
the Internet's records for the first.

202
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,090
The very next day is talk
about a approach to his friend.

203
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,310
Did Water Savarin Zoo,

204
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,010
helped finance the project is everyone
agreed to front of thousand dollars and

205
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,050
it would later say that he owned.

206
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:04,930
He caved in off.

207
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,760
Zuckerberg assured him that they'd be
able to use the new site to get light.

208
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,710
That January the 14th is acrobatic.

209
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,880
Finally stopped stringing,

210
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,730
render along in a face to face meeting.

211
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,600
He told him that he needed to
find a new program at their Indra,

212
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,670
pleaded with him to stay,

213
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,650
but doug,

214
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,590
he was already gone and the last forensic
weeks before the facebook launched,

215
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,990
it dawned on soccer bag this,

216
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,600
he was going to fail a module
on art in the time of Augustus.

217
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,171
Therefore,

218
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,380
he hatched a classic Zaka
Bec scheme in no time at all.

219
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,630
He knocked up a website and
encouraged his classmates,

220
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,770
do sham materials on it.

221
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,170
Within the 30 minutes of
the science going live,

222
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:41,480
it amassed enough materials and function
as his own private crib sheet soccer

223
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,680
bag past the module on
February the fourth,

224
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,401
2004.

225
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:48,800
The facebook.com finally went live smart
so that you can innovative it looked

226
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,330
shore to be the hottest
new site on campus.

227
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,930
As you already know,

228
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:53,161
though,

229
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,160
these success of Zuckerberg
and sovereigns projects,

230
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,340
it would not be confined to only Harvard.

231
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,190
The early days of facebook
and now legendary.

232
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,220
Over 4,000 people signed
up in the first two weeks.

233
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:11,940
By May,

234
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,490
almost 200,000 people are on board.

235
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,370
These figures are still impressive today,

236
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,470
but in the innocent days of 2004,

237
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,060
they were actually phenomenal.

238
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,421
Yeah.

239
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,770
Does not get the early success.

240
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:26,640
It was accompanied by a strange
defensiveness in the student paper,

241
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,451
the Harvard Crimson.

242
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:31,410
He published an open letter describing
how he always went out of his way to help

243
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:31,890
people,

244
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,191
you know,

245
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:35,970
before wheeling around and attacking the
renderer with all guns blazing by the

246
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,511
end of the article,

247
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,500
had managed to turn his own intellectual
property theft and see a scenario where

248
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,460
he was the victim,

249
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,260
not that anything about Zuckerberg,

250
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,430
his outward appearance
screamed victim Sama.

251
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,440
He was renting an apartment in Palo
Alto and trying to crack Silicon Valley.

252
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,580
One of his last acts before
leaving Harvard was to ask
Severin for an additional

253
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:57,420
$20,000 for the site and for
him to join back in California.

254
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,570
Savrin said yes to the first and to know
to the seconds this would not work out

255
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,020
well for him.

256
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,030
That June the first facebook headquarters
appeared in a house on the Jennifer

257
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,650
wait.

258
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,190
It was the punk into mass that Zika
Zuckerberg had always dreamed of.

259
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,720
The teams spent all day drinking,

260
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:15,100
bear and listening to green
day and all night programming,

261
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,730
Zuckerberg,

262
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,350
even soap to you,

263
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,940
carrying around a fencing foil,

264
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:22,320
sort of like a genre but reborn as
an entitled kid from New York State,

265
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,280
but it would take something
more to catapult to the
new social network into the

266
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:31,281
big time something or maybe someone
that's someone was napster co founder,

267
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,970
Justin Timberlake,

268
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,321
not ready.

269
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,340
That would be Shawn Parker.

270
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,620
He's played by Justin Timberlake
in the elementary and movie.

271
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,100
Sean Parker just happened to be living
a few blocks away from the never ending

272
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,420
facebook Frat party,

273
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,840
but I've always known to
suck a bag through sovereign
who'd introduced them at a

274
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:49,230
dinner one day his doctor bag just
happened to be walking past his house when

275
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,170
Parker came outside and the
to recognize one another.

276
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:52,621
Now,

277
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,990
if you want to pinpoint the moments
when Zuckerberg went from node with the

278
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,410
dreams you guy on a course to becoming
the world's youngest billionaire,

279
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,510
well this is probably it.

280
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,770
Pocket became the facebooks connection
to silicon valley's big money elite.

281
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,641
It was a connection,

282
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,451
even Zaka bags,

283
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,630
habit of arriving at
meetings in his pajamas,

284
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,080
could not break in August,

285
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,760
pay co founder Peter Teal
became the science first,

286
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:17,290
a big investor giving them a
cash injection of $500,000.

287
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,420
Suddenly with that things they were
looking very serious and we mean that hair

288
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:25,330
in more ways than one around the
time he always coming on board.

289
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:30,070
Savrin was not just being shown the door
that he was being thrown through it in

290
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,170
July of 2004 savarin fruits,

291
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,700
facebook's accounts off to soccer,

292
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,220
back fail to match his
$20,000 investments.

293
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,850
Soccer back responded by transferring
all of the facebooks assets to a new

294
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,420
version of the company that
was headquartered in Delaware.

295
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,550
This is both cups ever announced
and rendered his old stock.

296
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,210
Worthless.

297
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,210
Sovereign would later say that Zuckerberg
screwed me by December of 2004,

298
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:54,070
the facebook was pulling
in 1 million users.

299
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,040
Pocket took over as presidents and dinner.

300
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,220
Early 2005.

301
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,430
He forced through a name change
from this point on the site,

302
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,430
would simply be known as
facebook and they have that.

303
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:05,590
You have venture capital firms
sell apart and is invested.

304
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,410
Twelve point $7,000,000 in facebook.

305
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:12,820
The condition though was that the
company has to expand beyond just the Ivy

306
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,653
League schools.

307
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,660
That September the site was opened to
all colleges and high schools across the

308
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,930
United States by Christmas.

309
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,200
That will five point 5
million users and Zuckerberg,

310
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,460
well Zaka bag was riding a high yahoo at
MTV networks were both fighting to buy

311
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,700
stakes in the rising company and the
money was absolutely ruling in the one

312
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,930
major hiccups so far is that pocket had
had to resign after the allegedly busted

313
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,160
with cocaine at a party,

314
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,390
but facebook was still on a roll
and really the only way was up

315
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,600
by September of 2006.

316
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:54,620
Facebook was open to anyone with an
email address which set off a phenomenal

317
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,483
growth spat,

318
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,690
but 2006 was also the year we got our
first real look at Mark Zuckerberg after

319
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,470
getting burned by his program back
in 2004 Norendra hadn't given up,

320
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,950
along with the winklevoss twins and
launched a massive lawsuit against

321
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,540
Zuckerberg.

322
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,970
This came to a head just as
facebook was conquering the planet.

323
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,691
Unfortunately,

324
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:12,291
if a soccer bag,

325
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,000
this meant a lot of things from his past,

326
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,590
getting dragged Jonathan legal
depositions over to excruciating years.

327
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,160
The press slowly learned down,

328
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,400
Zach,

329
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,560
that I could offer to use this
private facebook data to his friends,

330
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:27,410
how had strung Narendra along while
stealing his idea and how it even once

331
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:30,350
harvested passwords from facebook
to hack the email accounts.

332
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,980
So journalists at the Harvard Crimson
who were sympathetic to Narendra.

333
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,670
It was a litany of wrongdoing.

334
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,090
The source of scandal there
could sink a lesser man,

335
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,153
but Zuckerberg,

336
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,340
he was lucky data privacy wasn't something
that people really cared about yet

337
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,410
and he still had that aura of rebellious.

338
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:45,831
Cool.

339
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:50,150
It's hard now to believe that facebook
ever had when he eventually settled with

340
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,760
no render out of for $65,000,000,

341
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,890
the world shrugged and went back
to Sharon cat memes by 2008,

342
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:59,900
facebook had become a global phenomenon.

343
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Aged 23 Zuckerberg was the youngest
self made billionaire in history.

344
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,990
Even as the rest of the planets economy
detonated in the financial crisis.

345
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,710
Facebook,

346
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,100
it just kept on growing as Zuckerberg
had learned himself and his miserable

347
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,000
freshman year.

348
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,920
No one likes to feel alone,

349
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,360
but if you think the rest of this video
is just going to be more of Zach back

350
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,230
becoming richer,

351
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,640
well casually stabbing
colleagues in the back.

352
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:22,970
Well,

353
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,780
prepare yourself for a bit of a twist
while the machiavellian soccer bag is

354
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,280
certainly a part of this story,

355
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:32,420
this another polyp to one
we haven't really touched
on in the rush to get to the

356
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:32,931
narrative,

357
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,190
and that's Zaka bag.

358
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,150
The philanthropist.

359
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,310
It started with $100,000,000 donation in
2010 to save new x public school system

360
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,850
from collapsing that same year,

361
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,490
[inaudible] signed the giving pledge,

362
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,930
committing himself to giving half of
his fortune away to charity by 2015.

363
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,160
He and his future wife here,

364
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,390
we're going to be back to in a moment,

365
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,770
we'll be giving 99 percent of
that fortune to charitable causes,

366
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
which was a record amount.

367
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,750
It's,

368
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,050
yeah,

369
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,190
we really get to the heart of what makes
soccer bag tick and they'd all have the

370
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,450
minute Galatians and scandals.

371
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,630
It's worth remembering that
at heart he's an idealist.

372
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,850
He really does the ones to
make the world a better place,

373
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:11,660
whether through giving or encouraging
us all to connect via facebook,

374
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,970
but he had soon set his
sights even higher Zaka.

375
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,510
I didn't just want to change
the world incrementally.

376
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,510
He wanted to actively shape.

377
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,050
It's to push everyone towards a better
future whether they wanted to go there or

378
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,710
not.

379
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,221
Ironically,

380
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:29,810
it would be this noble impulse that soon
sent him and his company on the road to

381
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:31,310
pr disaster

382
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,480
in October of 2014,

383
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:43,560
Mark Zuckerberg steps out of a bright
orange helicopter and the tiny Indian

384
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,140
village of Chan to Ali.

385
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,021
It was a hot day,

386
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,580
the pregnant with humidity,

387
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,430
but Zuckerberg had more
in his mind than the heat.

388
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,190
He was in Chengdu duty
to change the world.

389
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,780
It had been a good four years to be mom
because aca back in 2012 at married his

390
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,340
long time love Priscilla Chan.

391
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:02,610
Exactly one day after facebook had
gone public for the first time,

392
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,310
about a year after that
he would become a father.

393
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,480
Then there's the philanthropic
work that February is Aka Berg on,

394
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:10,320
failed something called Internet.org,

395
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,150
which was later renamed free basics,

396
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:15,840
a vision plan and south where everyone
would have access to an internet

397
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:16,410
connection.

398
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,270
Connectivity is a human rice.

399
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,320
It stated he was in India to
make that vision a reality.

400
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,360
The idea that Zuckerberg
pitch to the school,

401
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,070
children of Julie that October,

402
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,113
it was simple,

403
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,450
a free version of the Internet,

404
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,840
so that would give them
access to 36 sites,

405
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,280
including of course facebook,

406
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,870
as he left the village to Chez and
got back in his private helicopter,

407
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,110
Zaka the he must've felt like he was
doing God's work bringing digital

408
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,100
civilization,

409
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,510
so the Internet,

410
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,590
barbarians of rural India or any
not everyone saw it that way.

411
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,040
In fact,

412
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,210
to some Indian tech journalists sounded
a lot like free basics violated net

413
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:51,960
neutrality.

414
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,291
Indeed,

415
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,500
they kind of saw it as more
than digital era colonialism.

416
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,090
Soccer,

417
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,660
the could of course have countered this
narrative by listening to the concerns

418
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:01,650
of these writers,

419
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,700
but he didn't.

420
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,780
Instead,

421
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,200
he does what he had done
with sovereign ends,

422
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,250
Narendra and roll those years ago.

423
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,850
He struck first miss,

424
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,090
this was a bad move.

425
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,720
The scandal,

426
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,910
facebook's attacks stunned journalists.

427
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,990
The Guardian reports that
the site automatically
enrolls the profiles of users

428
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:23,250
into its empty nest and you're trying to
see petitions at one point even signing

429
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,030
up those who had been dead for two years
as one Indian generalist potentially

430
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,070
facebook came and shoved it sauce
in all phases of the campaign was so

431
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:37,010
manipulative that galvanized India
against facebook in February of 2016,

432
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,930
the country effectively
outlawed free basics.

433
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,490
Now in the normal run of things,

434
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,910
this would have just been one
misstep in the life of a company.

435
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,450
One more disaster that would
simply be chalked up to experience,

436
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,760
but here's the thing
about the free basics.

437
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,594
Debacle.

438
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,350
Zuckerberg,

439
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,340
he didn't learn.

440
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,160
What will you took away was
that when the next scandal hit,

441
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,080
it would have to fight even harder and
it wasn't long before that next scandal

442
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:01,914
arrived,

443
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,910
not six months later,

444
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:03,900
buzzfeed's editor,

445
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:04,740
Craig Silverman,

446
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,300
noticed a string of false stories
emerging from one small town in Macedonia,

447
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,630
but blowing up a big time
across all of facebook.

448
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,880
Nearly all involved the
presidential candidates.

449
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,990
Donald trump,

450
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,831
strangely,

451
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:20,670
the stories and the sites they linked do
seem to be multiplying and now for all

452
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:24,480
of them came from Macedonia as the
campaign season drags on other stones to

453
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,400
emerge from further east,

454
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,360
specifically from Russia two years
before an engineer at facebook.

455
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,960
It raised the alarm about unusual
levels of activity coming from Russia.

456
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,160
This is reports.

457
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,390
It's just been dismissed.

458
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,960
People were wondering whether the
Russians were using facebook to spread

459
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:40,794
propaganda.

460
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,750
Zuckerberg didn't think so.

461
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:42,841
Well,

462
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:46,470
November the 10th adjust two days off
to donald trump's shock when in the

463
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,270
bitterly contested election,

464
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,720
he made a speech cooling those worried
about fake news on his website,

465
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,310
crazy bus.

466
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,870
He wasn't telling the whole truth.

467
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,050
Facebook's own analysis published in 2017
would reveal Russian propaganda groups

468
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:04,380
that reached 126 million
Americans during the election.

469
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,910
Rather than be concerns,

470
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:07,200
those Aka bag and his board,

471
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,900
they issued denials on January the sixth,

472
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:10,950
2017.

473
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:15,210
The CIA declan's that
Russia has interfered in the
election and to the social

474
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:15,840
media,

475
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,070
particularly facebook,

476
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,530
had played a major role outwardly.

477
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,780
Zuckerberg and his board do.

478
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:23,310
They simply kept on
repeating that denials,

479
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,200
but behind the scenes panic,

480
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,270
it was beginning to set
in throughout April,

481
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:30,990
facebook launched to crack down on fake
news hoping to pull out ahead of the

482
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:31,740
scandal,

483
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,410
but by now it was too late by July,

484
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,870
Zuckerberg was claiming
no evidence existed,

485
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,620
that Russian actors bought facebook ads,

486
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:43,260
Sony for hard evidence to emerge
in September that indeed they did,

487
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,630
that Yom kippor he recorded a
public video asking for you,

488
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,180
hardly hopes this new to approach
would sue over the latest scandal,

489
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,260
unfortunately,

490
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,580
and even biggest scandal was already
waiting in the wings on March the 17th,

491
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:59,950
2018 or joint report by the Guardian,

492
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:00,761
The New York Times,

493
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:04,710
and Britain's channel for revealed that
a firm known as Cambridge Analytica had

494
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,720
used third party apps do harvest the data
of 80 million facebook users and that

495
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:14,971
data had been used to try and influence
votes everywhere from the US to Great

496
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:15,850
Britain to Mexico.

497
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,740
This data didn't just
come from using suit,

498
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,480
stupidly installed these apps.

499
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,990
Some of the apps automatically harvested
the data if that friends as well.

500
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,890
Crucially,

501
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,610
Zuckerberg,

502
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,470
he was aware of this facebook launched
open graph software in April of 2010

503
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:33,760
specifically to sell data including the
contents of private messages by the way,

504
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,830
to advertisers in May of that year.

505
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,430
Zuckerberg,

506
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,580
he wrote an op Ed in the Washington
Post addressing users concerns,

507
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,700
but nothing was done about it until 2014,

508
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,990
and even then the changes,

509
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,550
they weren't applied retroactively.

510
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,660
Any company like Cambridge analytica that
already had its claws into your data,

511
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,830
they didn't have to let
go the resulting scandal.

512
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:57,610
It exploded like a small bomb staining
the reputations of both facebook and Mark

513
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,540
Zuckerberg over 10 years after it was
first used data from the facebook to hack

514
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,730
the emails of Harvard Crimson Journalists.

515
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,150
Zuckerberg was in trouble
over a data privacy yet again,

516
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,170
or I need this time.

517
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,060
He had to testify on Capitol Hill.

518
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,260
On march the 20th,

519
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,130
2018,

520
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:15,220
the federal trade commission had
launched an inquiry into facebook.

521
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,170
Greg Burson,

522
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,060
you and others had set up similar
investigations that Spring moms talk about

523
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,160
privately told the facebook board
that his company was now at war.

524
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,960
Yet still the scandals didn't stop at
the time of this video is recording

525
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,970
facebook as a company
lurching from scandal,

526
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:33,910
the scandal dragging it's
found founder in its wake.

527
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,831
Among other things,

528
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:38,860
Zuckerberg burgs digital utopia has
been accused of facilitating ethnic

529
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:43,060
cleansing and Myeloma aiding
the harassment of survivors
of mass shootings and

530
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:47,770
spreading negative propaganda
about George Soros aged any 34.

531
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:52,570
Mark Zuckerberg has finally lost whatever
veneer of cool he and his creation

532
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,980
once had rich,

533
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,611
powerful,

534
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:57,340
and utterly convinced
of his own rightness.

535
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,271
He has refused,

536
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:02,680
cools to step down from facebook's board
or do anything but to keep on fighting

537
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,380
isolation in the eye of a
growing hurricane of scandal.

538
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,430
He no longer seems like the punk
nerd who appended communication,

539
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,550
but like king lear raging at the
sky as world crumbles around him.

540
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,450
Zuckerberg story,

541
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
it's not ovaries,

542
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,191
not yet 40,

543
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:23,191
but his biography as it stands today is
one of wanting a strange morality tale

544
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:27,550
of Hubris theft and misplaced good
intentions for our Internet age.

545
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,050
Whether the final act is
one that ends in Dhaka,

546
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,430
bugs,

547
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,031
redemption,

548
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:35,050
or as destination is something
that only time will tell.

549
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,940
So I really hope you enjoyed the video.

550
