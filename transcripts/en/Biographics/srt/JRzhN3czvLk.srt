1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,860
Two things before we get started today.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,431
One,

3
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:04,350
they're all weird
pronunciations in this one.

4
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:05,730
I'm looking them up when I can.

5
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:06,870
I have a laptop right here.

6
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,250
Sometimes it doesn't exist.

7
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:10,320
Sometimes they're just owned
the pronunciations available.

8
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,363
I'm doing my best,

9
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,700
but have a good.

10
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,930
I mean the comments if you want.

11
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:13,764
Second thing,

12
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,930

18
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,361
All right,

19
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:26,880
so for three years and eight months,

20
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,940
Pol Pot ruled over
Cambodia with an iron fist.

21
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,410
The legacy that he left his horrific
millions of families were torn apart.

22
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Hundreds of thousands were
terribly tortured and one
point 7 million of his own

23
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,240
people will put to death.

24
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,880
So how did it end this way?

25
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,210
On this week's biographics,

26
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,300
we attempt to see.

27
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:48,134
Colin says,

28
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,270
as we delve into the life of Pol Pot,

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,850
the man who the world would
come to know was polled.

30
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,150
Part was born Sar on January the 25th,

31
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,541
19,

32
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:14,541
25 in the small village of praxis in
Cambodia is was a peasant family and from

33
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,540
an early age he found himself working
long hours in the rice fields.

34
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,190
The selloff Klan were better off than
many being landowners who worked that own

35
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,024
rice fields,

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,873
saw his father,

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,680
owns nine hashtags and would employ
local workers at harvest time.

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,120
His mother saw him was a
devoutly religious woman who
brought up her children as

39
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,500
Theravada Buddhists.

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,350
Saul was the second to
youngest of nine children,

41
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:37,890
however,

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,090
three of them died early
according to his brother and A.

43
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,120
Saul was a considerate,

44
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,250
kind and hard working child.

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,091
During the day,

46
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,010
he and his brothers
would work in the fields,

47
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,830
then play in the rivers and on
the outskirts of the jungle.

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,551
In the evening,

49
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,840
they would gather around and open,

50
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:55,620
fire and sing the teachings and
histories of a local religious leader.

51
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,080
For the vast majority
of Railroad Cambodians,

52
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:00,480
life revolved around the
rice fields in the village.

53
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,660
If you've ever traveled to beyond
the borders of their birthplace,

54
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,703
however,

55
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,020
wanted his sons to
experience more from life.

56
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:08,160
So when he was six,

57
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,130
Sar and his older brother was
sent to the Cambodian capital,

58
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,080
Phnom Penh loft had a cousin by the name
of me who was employed as a consort to

59
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,220
the king of Cambodia,

60
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,870
and the boys were sent to live with him,

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
no longer considered as peasants sergeant,

62
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,710
his brother well now among the privileged.

63
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,341
As such,

64
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,110
they were educated by the French.

65
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,860
Colonial rule is in a school where the
teaching was done in the French language,

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,140
saw studied French literature and history,

67
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:35,490
filling his head with the events of the
1789 French revolution and the reign of

68
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:39,300
terror that followed under the
orchestration of Maximilian Robespierre.

69
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,880
Former school names rather
than saw was there quiet,

70
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,090
introspective young man who
kept his thoughts to himself.

71
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,890
He was an average student at best
apparently being held back two years.

72
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,820
Most of his classmates were the
children of French officials or Catholic

73
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:54,654
Vietnamese.

74
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,150
Cambodia was officially a monarchy,

75
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:57,984
but the king,

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,080
he ruled in name only with the real
power lying with the French colonial

77
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,860
governments.

78
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,490
At this time,

79
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,540
the French were tied up in a bit of a
struggle to hold onto their power in

80
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,120
neighboring Vietnam bad.

81
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,080
The Communist army under Ho Ci Minh was
leading the struggle for independence,

82
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,370
the Vietnamese revolutionaries
that started to train
small groups of Cambodians

83
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:22,390
and infuse them with the desire for
independence from this European rule.

84
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,850
This was a movement that was
spreading throughout all of India,

85
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
China at this time,

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,150
at the age of 28,

87
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,700
so traveled with some friends on a
pilgrimage to the famous temples at Angkor

88
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:38,910
Wat.

89
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,110
This site was the rallying point
for Cambodian nationalistic pride.

90
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,280
The trip left a lasting impression
on the young men in 1970,

91
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,114
70 status.

92
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,310
If our people could build ankle wash,

93
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,430
they could do anything we must revive
on national soul and pride in order to

94
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:59,400
defend the nation bills the country
well then preserve it forever.

95
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,040
The trip mocks the awakening of saws,

96
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,210
political consciousness,

97
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,130
and his drawing for independence.

98
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,180
In 1947,

99
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:10,410
he passed the exams and gained entrance
into the Cecil was author secondary

100
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,850
college and Phnom Penh,

101
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,070
but the following year he failed the
entry exam into the upper classes and he

102
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,890
had to leave the school with his academic
career seemingly at a standstill.

103
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,750
He began to study carpentry.

104
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,010
Then in 1949,

105
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,850
do you want a scholarship to study at
an elite engineering school in Paris?

106
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,230
For the first few months,

107
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:37,620
he indulged in the excesses that
Parisians social life had to offer.

108
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:41,160
This thing's changed when he came into
contact with some fellow Cambodian,

109
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,870
so you had views that builds upon the
spark of nationalist pride that had been

110
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,610
ignited at Angkor Wat.

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,660
The group that began meeting at size
apartments and discussions can lead to the

112
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:53,430
formation of two groups,

113
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,630
one who advocated working peacefully
towards independence from the French and

114
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,540
the other who were in
favor of armed resistance.

115
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,420
From the very start saw
was in the latter camp.

116
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,860
He endures likeminded friends.

117
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:08,400
They pointed to other countries around
the world were armed overthrow was

118
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,060
working,

119
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,420
and they noticed they all
had one thing in common.

120
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,060
The rebels were all communists.

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,020
There was a vibrant communist movements
in Paris at the time and sirens.

122
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,360
Those of his group he
worked for armed rebellion,

123
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,740
began attending meetings,

124
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,350
saw again studying the
teachings of Karl Marx,

125
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,450
but found them difficult to understand.

126
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,230
However,

127
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,520
he readily cottoned onto the writings
of Joseph Stalin and became a lifelong

128
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,900
advocate of Stalinism with its
emphasis on rapid industrialization,

129
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,460
totalitarian governments,

130
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,050
and the cult of personality.

131
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,190
In 1951,

132
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,550
he joined the Communist Party and by
the time that he returned to Cambodia in

133
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:45,540
1953,

134
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,340
he had committed himself to the cause
of the Cambodian revolution once back on

135
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:54,870
Cambodians soil sir journey north to
join up with Cambodian forces who had

136
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:59,000
attached themselves to the Vietnamese
communists and that fight for independence

137
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,834
from the French.

138
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,500
He now lived in the jungle is
a perspective guerilla fighter,

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,990
but first he amped to
do an apprenticeship.

140
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
For the first few months,

141
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,660
his duties consisted of maintaining the
group's vegetable patch paydays recalled

142
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,610
most everyone that was Vietnamese that
were very few Cambodians for a long time,

143
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,110
there was nothing for me to do.

144
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,390
After awhile they let
me work in the kitchen,

145
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,990
but really the Cambodians
were there in name only.

146
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,930
Victory was achieved by Vietnamese
communists in 1953 following the French

147
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:37,200
disaster at the battle of DNB and food.

148
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,490
The French pulled out of not just Vietnam,

149
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:40,720
but Cambodia also.

150
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,291
However,

151
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,400
the new nationalists,

152
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,160
Cambodian government who has
had it not by a communist,

153
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,420
probably the King Norodom Sihanouk
still the top third of Cambodia,

154
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,190
was under the control of Viet Minh,

155
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,490
so Erin's other local communist soldier,

156
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,520
the Viet Minh to continue pushing south
until the entire country was communist.

157
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,040
But the leadership of
the Viet Minh resisted.

158
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,874
This surgeon's.

159
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,770
A truce was arranged with the king,

160
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,910
so now resend to Phnom Penh where he
continued to work for the political

161
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:07,630
undergrounds.

162
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,220
His Day job was as a school teacher
where he taught history by noise,

163
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:11,680
however,

164
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,010
he worked to establish contacts
with every strata of society,

165
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:19,090
from intellectuals to peasants in
order to garner support for the coming

166
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,220
communist revolution around this time,

167
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:25,090
so at the man who would become his
closest political associates and second in

168
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:25,780
command,

169
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,700
nuon chat,

170
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,540
chat later recalled that Sir had an
innate ability to charm people and bring

171
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,560
them into the party.

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,280
Having the ability to explain things in
a way that simple people were able to

173
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,114
understand,

174
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,680
so also met up with a
revolutionary students who he
had worked with in Paris by

175
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:43,720
the name of King Van Zach.

176
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,171
Together.

177
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:48,040
They worked on plans for the country's
first free and open political elections,

178
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,280
so I went to vans,

179
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,840
Zach's house for breakfast every morning
to work on their party's manifesto.

180
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,680
However,

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,600
that work did not come to fruition.

182
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,800
King Sihanouk because renounced his
throat and formed his own political party,

183
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,783
the satin chrome.

184
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,590
He threw his hat into the 1955 general
election and one becoming Cambodia's.

185
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,410
New Prime Minister Nuke
had achieved this victory,

186
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,770
though by throwing his political
rivals into prison for sub,

187
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:16,000
the Shaman action marks the end of any
hopes he may have had for a democratic

188
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,070
means to bring about
change in his country.

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,910
He confirmed his commitment to violence
overthrow wins through himself towards

190
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,970
working toward that goal in July of 1956.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,580
So I married a fellow Communist Party
member by the name of q panare likes.

192
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,340
She had been educated in France and
was equally committed to the revolution

193
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:34,174
recourse.

194
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,050
They soon became the power couple of
the underground communist movements.

195
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,210
Life was increasingly dangerous for
the communists under the rule of CNN.

196
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,700
He had outlawed the Communist Party
and it's given them a new name,

197
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,930
the kind of of rouge,

198
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,600
the pace of imprisonments killings and
general Tara was stabbed top as the prime

199
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:00,660
minister to stamp out any and
all opposition to his rule.

200
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,040
The Communist Party secretary,

201
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,690
a close friend of so was taken to the
outskirts of Phnom Penh and killed his

202
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,770
during this climate of fear.

203
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:10,710
That's a accepted the
leadership of the Climber Rouge.

204
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,950
It was constantly followed by
the police who knew who he was,

205
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,810
but not his position in the party.

206
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,711
By 1960,

207
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:20,550
three things had gotten too hot for
Sarah in the capital city and d left to

208
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,960
dwell in the jungle in the north.

209
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,381
Yeah.

210
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:26,610
He was taken in by the Viet Minh who
had set up camps on the Vietnam Cambodia

211
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,270
border.

212
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,680
They were now focused on a new
enemy within their country.

213
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,730
That's of course the United
States from that Cambodian basis.

214
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:36,120
They would regularly traveling to
Vietnam to make lightening strikes before

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,690
retreating back over the border in
response to the American strawbs,

216
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,740
hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs
in north Cambodia and and attempts to

217
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,530
kill the Viet Minh and
the process they killed.

218
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,670
Over the course of the war,

219
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,640
nearly $150,000 Cambodians,

220
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,653
the American bombing,

221
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,060
have the effect of drawing more
and more people to the [inaudible].

222
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,350
Soon said no longer had to
rely only on the Viet Minh.

223
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,460
He now had his own gorilla camps stretched
out along the border and he himself,

224
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:05,490
he had transformed himself
in the mold of his hero,

225
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,330
Joseph Stalin.

226
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,180
He was the unquestioned party leader
and he now went by the name Paul Pot.

227
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,060
He lives apart from the rank and file of
his army and only allowed a select few

228
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,190
the privilege of having
an audience with him.

229
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,670
Paul believed that the lifeblood of his
revolutionary forces would come from the

230
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:21,450
peasantry,

231
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,410
but he also believed that they needed to
be molded so their soul allegiance was

232
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,244
to the party.

233
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,660
New recruits would undergo an intense
period of initiation where they would be

234
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,150
locked in a cell until they
were proven to be obedient.

235
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,500
Pole instituted as a rigid disciplinary
structure which included group meetings

236
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:41,520
where members have to confess their
weaknesses and seek forgiveness.

237
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,830
In 1970,

238
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,550
prime minister can newquist
overthrown by a military dictatorship.

239
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,790
He escape to the north and sought to
establish an alliance with this format

240
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,181
enemy,

241
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:59,110
the kind of bolstered by
the supporters of CNU.

242
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,940
The Canberra region
numbers rose by 64,000.

243
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,500
By the spring of 1964,

244
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,450
many of them went.

245
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:04,671
Now,

246
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,620
armed with Chinese supplied rifles,

247
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,610
pole vault saw me of gradually filtered
down from the border area and now

248
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:12,980
controlled two thirds of Cambodia.

249
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,510
By December of 1974 pole felt in a strong
enough position to make an assault on

250
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,170
the capital,

251
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,490
became a revision cycle,

252
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:20,091
Phnom Penh,

253
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,310
and began to close in
those you could flood.

254
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,230
The city is the streets became more zones.

255
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,610
Within five days,

256
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:29,140
the military government was
overpowered and the revolution was ifn.

257
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,470
April the 17th,

258
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:34,640
1975 was day zero and the
life of a new Cambodia,

259
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,870
Cambodia was now called Campo Chair and
it was under the control of it's stolen

260
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:40,760
and this leader Pol Pot.

261
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,271
Now,

262
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,650
just before we get into the really,

263
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:43,880
really dark part of this video,

264
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,020
Paul Potts reign of terror.

265
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,490
I do want to thank today's sponsor.

266
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:49,460
I know ads in the middle of these
videos are a little bit disruptive,

267
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:52,610
but these sorts of videos I think they're
important to make and they would be

268
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,444
impossible.

269
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,341
Our sponsors.

270
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:58,150
So I really do hope in exchange for this
long video about the life of Pol Pot.

271
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,810
You won't mind a quick word from the
fantastic squarespace if you've got an

272
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,040
important message to share,

273
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,370
you can do it with squarespace or maybe
you're like me and you need a place on

274
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,540
the web for people to find you,

275
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,780
or maybe you're starting a new business
and you need to set up a website for an

276
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:12,190
online presence or a store.

277
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,580
Well,

278
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,160
you should do all of that with
squarespace and with squarespace.

279
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,170
It all starts with a stunning template.

280
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,550
They really are super good looking,

281
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,200
or if you hate their beautiful templates,

282
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,340
I promise your won't.

283
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,560
You can start from
scratch and make it rain.

284
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,191
Squarespace.

285
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,770
Make it all super easy to make
something that looks amazing.

286
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,491
Furthermore,

287
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:31,090
you can easily move over an existing
domain and if you've hosted websites

288
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,953
anywhere else,

289
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,220
just move over to squarespace.

290
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:37,030
It's easy to do and then everything
after that point is just a lot easier.

291
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,781
With squarespace,

292
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,830
there's no patches,

293
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:39,820
there's no updates,

294
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:42,100
there's no tech crap that you
have to deal with all the time.

295
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,360
No one likes any of that.

296
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:43,691
Further,

297
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:46,570
squarespace does have 24 slash seven
support before making this out.

298
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:49,990
I went on and I tried it to see if I
could reach someone just randomly and

299
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,390
absolutely curd solid support.

300
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,224
It just works.

301
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,350
Look whatever you need a website for
whether it's for yourself or a business.

302
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,000
Squarespace is the place to do it.

303
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,720
Had to squarespace.com for a free
trial and when you're ready to launch,

304
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,160
go to squarespace.com,

305
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,810
forward slash buyer graphics,

306
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:08,590
and you'll get 10 percent off your
first purchase of a website or domain.

307
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,360
Thanks again to
squarespace for sponsoring.

308
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:14,860
Check them out through the link below
and now let's get back to the misery that

309
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,850
is Pol Pot.

310
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,410
The people who have been on Penn,

311
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,810
they enthusiastically
welcomes the climate rouge,

312
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,380
but the smiles tend to alarm
at the ruthlessness of Poles.

313
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:29,950
Men,

314
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,710
they shot any military forces on site.

315
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,740
Then Paul ordered a massive
evacuation of the capital.

316
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,320
The reason given was that the Americans
were about to bomb Phnom Penh.

317
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,000
Guy Maria soldiers went into the city
forcing people out of hospitals in their

318
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:43,600
homes.

319
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,030
Many died in the streets
in the melee that followed.

320
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,240
The reality was that there was
no threat of an American outrage.

321
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,630
Pol Pot simply wanted to get the
people now so the way so that he could

322
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,360
concentrate on rebuilding his new society.

323
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,500
He told his aides that they must use
cutting edge violence in order to build a

324
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,900
socialist system from the ground up.

325
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,520
The 2 million people who were forced out
of Phnom Penh has a pass through these

326
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,640
checkpoints on the outskirts of the city
that they were assigned to districts

327
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,070
for reeducation as field laborers,

328
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,550
the policy of equality with
strictly enforced with any
possessions that set city

329
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:19,240
folk apart from the peasantry
being taken off them,

330
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,000
Kangaroos,

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,680
soldiers went through the now deserted
capital and destroyed any of the

332
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,200
trappings of modern civilization
that they could find.

333
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,260
Any people who were found to be hiding
were taken into the street and shot under

334
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,170
Pol Pot regime.

335
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,110
Communist to quality meant that
everyone wants to be a peasant.

336
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,710
As a result of all of the modern
advances of the last 100 years.

337
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,980
They were rejected and even though former
city dwellers and peasants were now

338
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,960
working in the field side by side,

339
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,550
that kind of rear driver see us held a
special hatred for the form of urbanites

340
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,620
who are considered to be capitalists.

341
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,870
They were given only half of the
food rations of the peasants.

342
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,490
The equality policy included children to
live with [inaudible] teachers from the

343
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,540
age of seven onwards.

344
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,860
Private thoughts and feelings were
considered to be evil with uniformity,

345
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,340
the only acceptable way of life the
state who would choose which people got

346
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,730
married and anyone who was suspected
of falling in love outside of this

347
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,890
arrangements have beaten
to death and public.

348
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,480
The regime outlawed any form of
entertainment including sports with former

349
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,810
sports fields and basketball courts
being planted as rice fields.

350
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,560
The feeling of terror that had been
generated reached into the Asher lawns of

351
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:27,050
power with members of Paul's governments.

352
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,500
Iga.

353
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,130
It's approved that they too were
peasants and they worked in the fields.

354
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,911
As a result,

355
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,650
there was no real governance.

356
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,760
Poland's did use it,

357
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:36,800
a rice harvesting quota on the people,

358
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:40,070
which was three tons of
unhosted rice per hectare,

359
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,800
but less than a third of this
was actually being produced.

360
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,431
Meanwhile,

361
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,020
the people were suffering physically.

362
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,070
Disease was rife,

363
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,810
and millions suffered from malnutrition.

364
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,420
Hundreds of people were
dying every single day.

365
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,070
Paul blames the lack of success of his
great vision on infiltrators and enemies

366
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:55,850
of the party.

367
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,350
He devised a great purge to weed out
those nonconformists estate secrets.

368
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:03,290
Interrogations and do is set it
up so you in prison and torture.

369
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,330
Those were expected of being traitors.

370
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,040
The families of those arrested would
also be taken to the prison and tortured.

371
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,230
If a child was too young
to be interrogated,

372
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:15,170
it would be taken away and
simply killed immediately.

373
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,550
Any adults that you survived,

374
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:20,810
that torture were taken out to the
killing fields and beaten to death of the

375
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,800
14,000 prisoners you pass through the
gates of the main interrogation center in

376
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,634
Phnom Penh.

377
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,530
Only seven survived.

378
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,450
Many of those killed were loyal supporters
who were falsely accused of treason.

379
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,130
Paul Potts had succeeded in imposing his
ruthless iron fisted control within the

380
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:38,330
borders of Cambodia,

381
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,270
but there was a new threat to
his regime just over the border.

382
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,930
The Vietnamese is having seen off the
Americans now turn their attention on

383
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:45,700
Cambodia.

384
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,180
A border dispute threatened to bring
these two countries to war as the tensions

385
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:50,871
were rising.

386
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:53,510
Paulo did his latest purge
right on the border zone.

387
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,800
He suspected his defensive forces in that
area of colluding with the Vietnamese

388
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,180
after being viciously interrogated
more than 100,000 soldiers and party

389
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:07,181
officials along with their wives and that
children were executed as a result of

390
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:09,910
this wholesale massacre
of his own defense forces.

391
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,270
Paul left is eastern border with Vietnam
open to invasion and that invasion came

392
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,230
on Christmas Day.

393
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,550
Nineteen 78,

394
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,170
taking just 13 days for the
capital of Phnom Penh to fall.

395
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,330
Pol Pot managed to slip away
and escape into the jungle,

396
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:26,750
but at least his three and a half
year reign of terror was over.

397
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,220
In total it'd cost the lives
of nearly 2 million people.

398
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,260
The caiman ridge may have been over,

399
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,700
but the party persisted for nearly 20
years at retina and continued to wage

400
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:39,830
guerrilla warfare from its jungle basis.

401
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,371
Ballpark,

402
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:43,940
set up a base near the Thai border and
rebuilt his military force with the aid

403
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,650
of the Chinese and Thai governments.

404
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,221
Meanwhile,

405
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:49,000
the Vietnamese that installed a new
government made up of kind of rear

406
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,180
supporters who had escaped polls pageants

407
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,570
from his base in the
northern part of the country.

408
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,680
Paul gave occasional interviews
to reporters in which he
would invariably accuse

409
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,980
those who opposed him of being traitors.

410
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,950
In 1985,

411
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:10,130
it was announced that he was retiring
from the leadership of the kind of rouge.

412
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,330
Shortly thereafter,

413
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,960
the enemy's clamps down on the climate
region moving into their strongholds and

414
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,220
decimating that basis.

415
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,570
Paul managed to escape into Thailand's
where he remained for the next few years.

416
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,830
In 1988,

417
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,050
he went to China to undergo
treatment for cancer.

418
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,940
The enemy's withdrew from Cambodia.

419
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,760
In 1988 prompting polls
or a from Thailand.

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,590
For the next eight years,

421
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:33,950
the Caiman Rouge ran guerrilla
operations against government forces.

422
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,210
In 1996,

423
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:38,760
the government began engaging in peace
negotiations with individual kind of

424
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,650
leaders,

425
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,590
leading many of them to effect
away from the organization.

426
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,260
Meanwhile,

427
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,460
Paul had suffered a stroke and was
paralyzed on the left side of his body,

428
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,490
but this didn't stop him from
handing out death sentences.

429
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,650
When he heard that his
longtime righthand man,

430
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,690
I'm was negotiating with the government,

431
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,381
the audit,

432
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:58,040
his arrest and execution around this
time that they've been members of Paul's

433
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,540
family were also killed.

434
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,970
Though it is unclear whether
he ordered those killings.

435
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,290
On June the 19th,

436
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:03,651
19,

437
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:07,760
97 pole was arrested by the head of
the military who had had enough of his

438
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:08,720
murderous ways.

439
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,550
A show trial was conducted
for the ordering of the
execution of transcendence.

440
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,890
Pole was confined to house
arrest for the rest of his life

441
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,991
and it's finally,

442
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:27,130
as Paul had become an avid listener to
the voice of America radio show on the

443
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,150
night of April the 17th,

444
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:28,961
1998.

445
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:32,320
He was surprised to hear that the
[inaudible] should agree to handover to an

446
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,780
international tribunal for
crimes against humanity.

447
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,830
Later that night,

448
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,843
he died in bed.

449
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,600
Paul Paul's body was requested by the
Cambodian government for inspection,

450
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,170
however,

451
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,020
he was cremated and his followers before
the government could get their hands on

452
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:44,410
it.

453
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:44,861
This is that.

454
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:48,430
Be Able to speculate that he actually
committed suicide rather than being handed

455
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:49,264
over to the court.

456
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,253
As a result,

457
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,160
neither he nor anyone else has ever
faced justice for the horror of Cambodian

458
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,110
killing fields.

459
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,300
