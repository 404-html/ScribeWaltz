1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,680
Totally deaf,

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,340
religious founds,

3
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,440
a Scifi innovative military heroin.

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,770
There's a lot of question marks when
it comes to l dot Ron Hubbard's life,

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,220
the life story he is told over the years
and the life story that many of his

6
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:14,300
fellow is point to is not the same
story that documents and other official

7
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,990
sources tell the details
of his life or uncertain.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,840
There is no question that his life was
a fascinating trip from a midwestern

9
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:24,830
childhood to an internationally
recognized right on and influence that

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,220
the man who rose to influence some of
Hollywood's biggest names was born far

11
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:48,510
from the lands of Celebrity Hubbard
was born in 1911 in Nebraska.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,080
His mother was a teacher and his father
was a military man when Hubbard was only

13
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:52,741
to his family,

14
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,480
moved from Nebraska to Montana,

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,020
and Hubbard grew up in a townhouse that
we as made claims that the family lived

16
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:58,760
on a ranch,

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,280
but that's just one of many claims that
has been debunked by family members,

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,360
government officials,

19
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:07,080
and others who actually knew Hubbard
as he was growing up and starting his

20
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,660
career.

21
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,380
[inaudible] father was in the navy,

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,560
been traveled around the world,

23
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,020
but Hubbard didn't accompany
him outside of the country.

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,070
Some stories about hubbards teen life
do suggest that he lived in places like

25
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,480
China and Guam and Japan,

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,960
but it's not clear if this is in fact
part of his official life or part of the

27
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:25,680
mystique built up around him and the
study of eastern medicine as part of his

28
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,940
scientology persona.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,080
Truly separating fact from fiction is
difficult when it comes to Hubbard's life.

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,410
The Hubbard family briefly
lived in Washington state
and Hubbard attended school

31
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,940
for some years on the west coast,

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,480
then return to Montana as a finished high
school and live with his grandparents

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,010
and his parents lived overseas.

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,020
After graduating from high school,

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,880
I left the Midwest and headed east to
the nation's capital at George Washington

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:47,881
University.

37
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:51,750
He studied engineering but dropped out
after only two years due to failing

38
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,960
grades without a college degree
and no prospects ahead of him.

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,070
He turned to his imagination and his
began penning Saifai and horror stories to

40
00:01:59,071 --> 00:01:59,880
earn a living.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,650
He was only making a penny a word,

42
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,980
though meant you had to write prolifically
in order to earn enough to live on.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,340
You don't get rich writing science
fiction if you want to get rich,

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,630
you start a religion.

45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,670
Hubbard one said this as well.

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,120
He certainly knew what he was talking
about because he had to crank out so many

47
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:15,810
stories.

48
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,140
Hubbard now holds the Guinness World
Record for the most translated and

49
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,910
published author in the world.

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,380
During the 19 thirties,

51
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,010
he wrote under several pseudonyms and
wrote dozens of stories across nearly

52
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,360
every literary genre.

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,680
He published novels and some reports
even say that he wrote as many as 100,000

54
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,550
words a month.

55
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,770
Science fiction became
what he was best known for.

56
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:39,270
Anti even moved in the social circles
of men like Isaac Asimov and Robert

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,480
Heinlein,

58
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,141
hubbards racing.

59
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,640
It also caught the attention of Hollywood.

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,700
He wrote the script for the secret of
treasure islands and claims that he helped

61
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,780
write several other movies,

62
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,760
including John Ford stagecoach,

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,460
but his name doesn't actually appear
in the credits for this movie.

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,720
In the year 2000.

65
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:55,020
His work was prominently featured on the
big screen when his novel battlefield

66
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,010
Earth was made into a movie starring
none other than devout scientologist.

67
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,010
John Travolta,

68
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,460
right writing Korea like so many other
American men's careers was interrupted by

69
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,990
the outbreak of World War Two.

70
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,180
He joined the navy reserve in 1941.

71
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,130
Ends upon the recommendation
of his congressman.

72
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,570
He was made a lieutenants.

73
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,080
The stories of hubbards military career
have been polished and exaggerated for

74
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,520
the benefit of scientology.

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,040
Tales of overseas heroism abounds hands.

76
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,720
The scientology version of his war record
has been receiving 21 metals for his

77
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,980
actions during the war,

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,660
including injuries that
supposedly left him blind.

79
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,630
It cripples in reality,

80
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:44,350
though the story of hubbards military
service is a little bit different.

81
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,010
Official military records show that
he never actually left the continental

82
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,750
United States during the war,

83
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,760
and he also wasn't a hero far from his.

84
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,270
In fact,

85
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,550
he lost the command of his
ship after a number of mishaps,

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,880
including having his crew fire bought
what he thought was a submarine off the

87
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,720
coast of Oregon.

88
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,111
Well,

89
00:03:59,111 --> 00:03:59,944
there's submarine.

90
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,070
It actually turned out to
be a large floating log,

91
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,590
even though Hubbard was
relieved of his command,

92
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,620
he was allowed to stay in
the navy on inactive duty.

93
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,970
It was in 1958.

94
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,810
He officially resigned his commission
and left the military behind for good.

95
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,000
Nobody's active students in the navy
where Nice stayed on the west coast moving

96
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,010
to Los Angeles in 1945.

97
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,780
He hadn't been married in 1933,

98
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:35,350
but his wife wouldn't bring along the
whole family to California from Washington

99
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,184
to live there.

100
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,650
Later Habits said his wife left
him because he was a cripple.

101
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,260
I was abandoned by family and friends as
a supposedly hopeless crippled mandate.

102
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,830
Probable burden upon them for the rest
of my days is how his version of the

103
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:51,610
stories of those ugly goes in
California without his wife or children.

104
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,180
Hubbard found himself with a new
family of sorts and unless the Crowley,

105
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:58,870
that famous practitioner of magic was
leading a group and some would say a cult

106
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,681
called auto,

107
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,990
temporally or orientalist.

108
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,880
Hubbard's joined the group and found
an outlet for his interest in science

109
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,240
fiction.

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,680
The occult and the fantastical.

111
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,270
How moved in with Jack Parsons
and his girlfriend Sarah Parsons,

112
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,930
or some members of the
group and the three,

113
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:14,650
they became close friends perhaps to
close because eventually hubbards began

114
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:18,800
sleeping with Parsons girlfriends and
Parsons didn't seem to mind seeing them.

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Another female Marjorie Cameron joined
the group and started sleeping with her,

116
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,620
but their sexual encounters
had an occult end goal.

117
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,400
They wanted to impregnate
cameron with the spawn of Satan.

118
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,260
Apparently this required Hubbard.

119
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,720
Do you watch the couple while
they engaged in intercourse,

120
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,560
their behavior,

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,590
I've been surprisingly never
resulted in the spawn of Satan,

122
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,700
but these exploits did end in a lasting
relationship between Hubbard and

123
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,534
northrop.

124
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,610
The couple were married in 1946,

125
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,250
but Hubbard hadn't yet
divorced his first wife.

126
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,460
It took a year for his first wife to
find out that he had married again,

127
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:54,030
making Hubbard a big
interest for an entire year.

128
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,040
The divorce filings do not
paint a pretty picture.

129
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,950
Hubbards first marriage among the
accusations included in the papers is that

130
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,910
systematic torture beatings that
strangulations and scientific torture

131
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,744
experiments.

132
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,020
Well,

133
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,190
among the things hubbards first wife
was subjected to wants divorce stands,

134
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:10,641
once again,

135
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:12,260
monogamous harbored a northrop,

136
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,820
moved to Laguna Beach,

137
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,710
then to Georgia,

138
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,000
and they finally settled in New Jersey.

139
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,050
It was that,

140
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,280
but he began the crafting the work that
served as the basis for scientology

141
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,630
on May the fifth,

142
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:33,991
19,

143
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:34,990
50 that work,

144
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
but it was introduced to the world.

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,130
The publication of dianetics,

146
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,720
the modern science of mental health,

147
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,990
brought hubbards ideas about
psychology to the masses.

148
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,921
Within months.

149
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:47,730
The book was selling at a
rate of thousands a week
and it was translated into

150
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:48,900
several languages,

151
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,870
essentially dianetics stores and that,

152
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:50,940
uh,

153
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,450
memories which Hubbard referred to as
end grams are the reason that people

154
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:58,110
experienced psychological pain and
its associated health problems.

155
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,890
In the book,

156
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,970
he described how people can release
their in grams and work towards becoming

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,810
clear.

158
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,080
This is the term he used for being cured
of all the ills caused by an grants

159
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,790
even alleged that he cured his own war
injuries through the use of dianetics.

160
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,480
And he even said that leukemia was caused
by an angry and could be cured through

161
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:16,530
dianetics.

162
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,530
Leukemia is evidently
psychosomatic in origin,

163
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,940
and at least eight cases of leukemia had
been treated successfully by dianetics.

164
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,400
After medicine had traditional,

165
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,150
they'd given up the source of leukemia,

166
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,910
has been reported to be an
engram containing the phrase,

167
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,850
it turns my blood or water pub as well.

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,630
He was one who never understate
his achievements and he
had no doubts about what

169
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:39,390
dianetics could mean for the
world and for human health.

170
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,800
A milestone for comparable to his
discovery of fire and superior to his

171
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:48,180
invention of the wheel and the arch well
Hubbard was short about his theory of

172
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:48,931
psychology.

173
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:52,320
The scientific world
wasn't so quick to agree.

174
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,040
As the book continued to
sell and dianetics groups
began to pop up around the

175
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:56,550
nation.

176
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,190
Scientists and medical professionals
began to speak about their disbelief.

177
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,230
In dianetics,

178
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,100
the American Psychological Association
Dismiss dianetics as did scientific

179
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:05,850
American.

180
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,930
They said that hubbards ideas weren't
based in facts and he had nothing but

181
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,280
baseless promises.

182
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,331
Nonetheless,

183
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,860
the teachings of Dianetics,

184
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,000
they'd kept spreading.

185
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,910
Hubbard spends much of
1950 touring the country,

186
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,120
giving lectures on dianetics
and conducting seminars.

187
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,290
Dianetics groups sprouting up in large
cities and people started sending money

188
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:29,010
to the groups wanting to start on the
path to becoming clear or wanting to learn

189
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:33,030
how they could help others become clear
by being what is called a dianetics

190
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,893
auditor,

191
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,960
and it's all the traveling
and the middle of the theme,

192
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,810
how they couldn't keep his second marriage
going in architect keepers finances

193
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,290
in line,

194
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,590
he was having an affair with his public
relations assistance and dianetics

195
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,430
foundations around the
country were floundering only
a couple of years after his

196
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:49,140
book was an astounding success.

197
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,280
L Ron Hubbard was divorced a second time
and it wasn't looking like dianetics

198
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:56,100
was going to be any sort
of long term movement,

199
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,851
but hubbards well,

200
00:08:56,851 --> 00:09:00,570
he had astounding charisma and he had a
theory that people that easily latched

201
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,910
onto and wanted to believe in.

202
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,960
One of the dianetics believers was
a millionaire named Don purcell.

203
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,750
He hadn't lost faith in
Hubbard's ends dianetics zs,

204
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,440
and he wanted to support the cause so
he poured money into a building and the

205
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:16,320
brand new foundation for
dianetics researching Kansas.

206
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,330
His support and his ideas,

207
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,840
they were no match for Hubbard
after he ends harbored,

208
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,570
had disagreements about the foundation
that organization fell apart and

209
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,710
ultimately ended up losing its money
to cover the depths of other lapsed

210
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,240
dianetics foundations.

211
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,550
Though the foundation in
Kansas didn't work out,

212
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,590
it wasn't a total loss for Hubbard.

213
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,660
He was able to launch Hubbard College
in the states and even met his next

214
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,600
brilliant that she was only 18
and to move together to Phoenix,

215
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,434
Arizona.

216
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,760
During this period,

217
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,020
Hubbard took the next leap forward in
sharing his ideas about psychology and the

218
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,130
human experience.

219
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,750
He started working on putting his ideas
about dianetics into a larger spiritual

220
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,040
and philosophical frame.

221
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,933
In other words,

222
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,680
it was creating scientology.

223
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,210
In 1954,

224
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,460
the Church of scientology
officially launched.

225
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,980
However,

226
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,100
Bas with much of scientology's history,

227
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,670
there is dispute about which
church was the official start.

228
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,140
Was it the one in California founded by
a member or was it hubbards organization

229
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,220
in New Jersey?

230
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,941
Either way,

231
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:18,360
Hubbard to put forth the ideas for the
structure of the church and it's his name

232
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,820
that will forever be
linked with scientology.

233
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,470
Alright,

234
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,020
so well,

235
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,220
what is scientology?

236
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,630
Well,

237
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,870
how about described it this way.

238
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,910
Scientology is the study of knowingness.

239
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,530
It increases one's knowingness,

240
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,620
but if a man were totally aware
of what was going on around him,

241
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,660
he would find it relatively simple to
handle any outbursts in that and according

242
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,660
to the churches website,

243
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:41,160
scientology teachings contained
answers for nearly everything,

244
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,210
a human good ones and know contains there
in our answers to life's most profound

245
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,020
mysteries,

246
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,400
the enigma of existence,

247
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,330
the riddle of death,

248
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,840
the realization of states not even
described in earlier literature.

249
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,620
Also from these works come scientology
technologies to rear children,

250
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,490
repair families,

251
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:57,090
educate,

252
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,570
organize and provide relief in
times of illness or suffering.

253
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,920
By 1956,

254
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,210
the Church of Scientology,

255
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:06,630
it was officially considered a church
in the eyes of the government and

256
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,090
therefore was a tax exempt organization.

257
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,730
Hubbard was making money
as people joins the church,

258
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,390
bought the materials and spends money to
move through the ranks of scientology.

259
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,630
One session with a scientology auditor
could cost a person that $300 and of

260
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:24,930
course you could not just have one
session as you kept working your way up.

261
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,400
Getting closer to being clear,

262
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,480
you have to spend more money to work
with auditors and to achieve more within

263
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,230
the church.

264
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,400
People were spending a lot of money to
be a member of scientology and to achieve

265
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,590
what Hubbard had promised
them was possible,

266
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,120
but just because scientology was growing
and was flushed with cash doesn't mean

267
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,500
it was without its problems.

268
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,730
Government is targeted,

269
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:48,330
the organization worried
about the consequences of
scientology on the health of

270
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:52,090
its members and there was also this
growing reputation for intimidation among

271
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,070
scientologists.

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,890
The Australian government even went so
far as to say that scientology was a

273
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:59,110
serious threat to the community medically,

274
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,370
morally and socially,

275
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,360
and it's adherence,

276
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,970
sadly diluted and often mentally ill.

277
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,490
The United States government
was also concerned.

278
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,030
In fact,

279
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,770
they had been watching Hubbard for years.

280
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,180
Some reports even say that the FBI had
interviewed him as early as 1951 and was

281
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:14,620
not happy with his mental state.

282
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,730
In 1963,

283
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,910
the Washington DC scientology
church was raided by the feds,

284
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:21,400
discovered just how much hubbard
was making off the church.

285
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,480
He was taking millions out of the coffers
of this organization and paying no

286
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:26,670
taxes to the government.

287
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,310
It was this the cause scientology
to lose its tax exempt status.

288
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,220
Public wasn't willing to let this
treatment by the US government stand,

289
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:37,330
though he created a new office within
scientology to deal with negative

290
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,164
publicity.

291
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,740
The scientologists in charge of
this office took aim aggressively.

292
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,480
Liberty accusing Scientology's,

293
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,190
detractors of libel and slander.

294
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,080
Others wanted to bring down his attack
is and was willing to do whatever it took

295
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,943
to do so.

296
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,540
Lower red blood sex crime,

297
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,560
actual evidence,

298
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,251
and it's what he wanted.

299
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,240
His publicity office defines on those
who were attacking scientology's

300
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,030
reputation.

301
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,030
Even with an aggressive
publicity approach.

302
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,880
A scientology didn't get their tax
exempt status back for another 30 years.

303
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,160
As a judge came under
attack from governments.

304
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,000
Hubbard saw a solution on the open
seas where governments couldn't get in.

305
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,030
It was this that caused him to
dream up another organization.

306
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,290
This one known as sea org.

307
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,490
The sea org was basically scientology
on the ocean with its members living

308
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:18,850
abroad.

309
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,590
Three ships that Hubbard had purchased.

310
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,590
There was a major cash though
to be welcomed into the sea org.

311
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,510
You have to sign a contract saying that
you would be loyal to scientology for 1

312
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,320
billion years.

313
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,240
Even though the group
was based aboard ships,

314
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,280
they still faced resistance
from governments.

315
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,940
The Greek government asked them to leave
Corfu after a year and there's Morocco

316
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,360
was no more welcoming to them being part
of the sea org and selling around the

317
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,160
world was not against to
being on a cruise ship.

318
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:42,610
There.

319
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,121
Instead,

320
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,050
there was little food,

321
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,800
long hours for those tending to the ship
and dirty clothes and linens were the

322
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:48,420
norm.

323
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,430
I would himself only lasted on
the open sea for a few years.

324
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,070
You have taken breaks on land
in the early 19 seventies,

325
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,630
but in 1975,

326
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,760
he returned to life on land for good.

327
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,930
Upon his return,

328
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,990
he settled in California and after
two decades in the spotlight,

329
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,950
l Ron Hubbard began to fade away from
his charismatic leadership role in the

330
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,784
church.

331
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,280
The is on the ocean and
not a raised scientology's.

332
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,590
Problems with the government's Hubbard
and his organization were being chased by

333
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:25,030
French and US authorities.

334
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,150
And didn't even manage to get themselves
embroiled in Morocco and political

335
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:28,571
issues.

336
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:32,140
While they're sea org ships would
dock that solution to these problems,

337
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,430
wants to keep themselves hidden.

338
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,520
The church kept fighting with Hubbard
pulling the strings and directing

339
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:40,090
operations that went to elaborate lengths
to infiltrate the federal governments

340
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,740
and disrupting investigations.

341
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,910
One operation called Snow White involved
everything from breaking into irs

342
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:50,260
offices to bugging the federal governments
to even infiltrating government staff

343
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,100
with scientology.

344
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,240
You could report back to the church.

345
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,610
A former scientologist said
that Hubbard always said,

346
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,503
never defends,

347
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,470
always attack.

348
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,100
This was gospel and that's pretty much
what the church did and it landed.

349
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,300
11 people in jail,

350
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,680
including hubbards wife.

351
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,100
As all of this was going on,

352
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,950
I was still hiding out at home.

353
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,340
He suffered from a number of
health problems throughout
the 19 seventies and 19

354
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,180
eighties,

355
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,990
a heart attack.

356
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,040
Pulmonary embolism,

357
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,610
injuries sustained in a motorcycle,

358
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,590
accidents and more.

359
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,870
He was obese and he smoked constantly.

360
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,850
The man simply wasn't healthy.

361
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,240
He moved around trying to stay out of
the public eye and away from potential

362
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,430
government action against him.

363
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,720
He had a team of teenagers
who took care of him,

364
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,070
washing his clothes and
holding out ashtrays for his
ever present cigarettes by

365
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,940
1996.

366
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,390
His health issues that mounted to a point
where they couldn't be overcome at the

367
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:36,290
age of 74,

368
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,770
l Ron Hubbard passed away after
suffering a stroke when he died.

369
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,560
He hadn't made a public
appearance in six years.

370
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,240
The New York Times said
mystery surrounding his
death just as a cloak to the

371
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,073
final years of his life.

372
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,860
He was cremated and his ashes were
scattered at sea by scientologists.

373
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,650
Seven years after Hubbard's death in 1993,

374
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:57,770
the irs reinstated the
church is tax exempt status.

375
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,340
The irs has not given an explanation
about why it was granted again,

376
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,420
but the scientologists good celebrate
then nearly $8,000,000,000 in assets.

377
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,190
We're once again safe from
taxation l Ron Hubbard's.

378
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,900
Life is fraught with contradictions
between church teachings and official

379
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,920
government documents,

380
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,410
and he's certainly a controversial figure.

381
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,340
A California judge ruling on a scientology
lawsuit didn't hide his feelings

382
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:20,360
about Hubbard at all.

383
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,620
The evidence portrays is a man who has
been virtually a pathological liar when

384
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:25,730
it comes to his history,

385
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,350
backgrounds and achievements.

386
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,251
He had egotism,

387
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:28,670
greed,

388
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,121
avarice,

389
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,290
lust for power and vindictiveness
and aggressiveness against a person's

390
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,970
perceived by him to be
disloyal or hostile.

391
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,200
Hubbard was a midwestern boy with an
imagination and that aptitude for language

392
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,750
that we didn't fare well at
George Washington University.

393
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,010
He was able to use this charisma and
considerable aptitude for propaganda to

394
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:49,070
build an organization that
remains largely intact today.

395
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,610
It's attracted the likes of Tom Cruise
and other Hollywood luminaries to Ed's

396
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,150
ranks,

397
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,920
and although it takes hits after,

398
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:55,754
hits in the press,

399
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,810
scientology marches on and l Ron
Hubbard has a legacy that lives on

400
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,800
controversial,

401
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,510
though it may be so.

402
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:03,650
I really hope you enjoyed that video.
