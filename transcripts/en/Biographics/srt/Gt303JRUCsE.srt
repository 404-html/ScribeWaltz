You'll learn more about
brilliant later in today's video,

00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,480
but if you would like to learn
more about them right now,

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,480
it goes a brilliant.org
forward slash biographics.

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,970
You'll also find a link
in the description below.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,020
He was America's first and most
celebrated western anti hero.

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,480
It was claimed that he kills 21 men,

8
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,250
one for every year of his young life,

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,380
and the press portrayed him as a ruthless,

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,540
psychotic wild.

11
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,374
I kill it.

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,560
The reality was that billy,

13
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:25,891
the kid,

14
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,240
was none of these things.

15
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,800
I mean this week's biographics,

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,440
we go in such of the real early,

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,180
there is uncertainty as to the birthplace
of the child who would become a

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,990
believer kit.

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,990
Most historians believe that
was the slums of New York City,

20
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:51,980
and the year was 18,

21
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:52,814
59.

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,290
His birth name was Henry Mccarty and he
was the son of Irish immigrants who had

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,820
come to America to escape the devastating
effects of the Irish potato famine.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,620
His mother's name was Katherine,

25
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:07,550
but we know nothing about his father
except that he died when Henry was an

26
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:08,150
infant.

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,200
When Henry was around six and his
mother joins the post civil war exodus,

28
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,700
do the West in such.

29
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:17,060
If the batter life that had so
far alluded them in the new world,

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,020
they drained a wagon train and undertook
the arduous journey over the Oregon

31
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:21,770
trail.

32
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,930
They go as far as Indianapolis,

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,790
Indiana,

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,090
there,

35
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,520
Karen and Matt had married a man
by the name of William Harrison.

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,200
Trim and trim had dreams of striking it
rich in the gold mines to the southwest.

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
And soon the makeshift family
had relocated to silver city,

38
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,034
New Mexico,

39
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,570
New Mexico in the early eighties,

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,410
seventies was like a foreign
country to immigrants from the east.

41
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,590
It was mainly peoples by
Mexicans and native Americans.

42
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,280
The entire culture and religion was very
different to what most Americans were

43
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:49,760
used to.

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,121
French,

45
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:53,000
Spanish and Navajo were more
likely to be spoken in English.

46
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,840
And most houses were maces carved
into the sides of rock formations.

47
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,090
In this Hodgepodge of cultures,

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
violence was commonplace.

49
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,900
What many newcomers from the east would
have recoiled at such an environment,

50
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:05,301
a young,

51
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:05,350
uh,

52
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,250
Henry Annacarty.

53
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,490
He embraced it,

54
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,430
immersed himself in the Mexican culture,

55
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,380
spending most of his time in
the Hispanic part of town.

56
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,850
By the time he was a teenager,

57
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:18,200
he could speak fluent Spanish and
could even pass for native Mexican with

58
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,870
Sombrero and pawn shape.

59
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,970
Whenever that was a public
Mexican social events,

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,340
Henry would be that often with his mother.

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
The two would dance,

62
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:29,540
the fandango together and talk
easily with the Mexican elders.

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,430
Unlike most of the Europeans in town,

64
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:35,720
Henry showed respect to the
locals exhibiting a formal
politeness to the older

65
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:36,560
generation,

66
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,970
which one have a lot of praise.

67
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,160
He was remembered by
the Hispanic community,

68
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,500
is a charming boy who was always happy.

69
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,590
The humor was cruelly snatched from
Henry's life when at the age of 15,

70
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,340
he suffered the loss of his mother.

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Katherine had been suffering
from tuberculosis for
some time and it was hoped

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,290
that the dry air of New
Mexico would say condition,

73
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,760
but it wasn't to be.

74
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,920
Catherine died in 1874,

75
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,590
believing henry and the
possession of his stepfather,

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,700
William Antrim.

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,380
Andrew,

78
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,960
however,

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,660
had no intention of being
tied down with a teenage.

80
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,660
Boys look after he
promptly abandoned 10 read,

81
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,360
leaving town,

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,780
and more fertile gold diggings,

83
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
so with the age of 15,

84
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,080
Henry was left on his own to fend for
himself in a dangerous frontier town.

85
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,300
Henry now had to live off his wits.

86
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,710
He spends his time hanging around the
saloons and prostitutes on the cds sign of

87
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:33,140
town,

88
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,090
sleeping in back alleys and boarding
houses and running errands to pay his way.

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,290
He soon became involved in minor criminal
activity and meeting up with a hoodlum

90
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,700
by the name of some railroad.

91
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,010
Jack Henry was recruited as a lookout.

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,761
Well Jack,

93
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,020
Rob's local businesses.

94
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,330
One of them was the local Chinese laundry.

95
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,460
Things fall apart when a loaded revolver,

96
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,070
that jacket sterling from the laundry,

97
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,940
was found in Henry's possession.

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
Boy was arrested and
thrown into the local jail.

99
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,490
It was while sitting in that tiny jail
salvage Henry made a fateful decision.

100
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,420
He could have sat and waited for the
circuit judge to come to town and try his

101
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:12,751
case,

102
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,190
but that may have taken months.

103
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,880
Instead,

104
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,470
he decided to escape.

105
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,400
In doing so,

106
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,860
he honed the skill that would
serve him to good effect.

107
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,970
Many times over the next five years that
was getting people to underestimate his

108
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:24,804
abilities,

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,260
henry talked his God into allowing him
to come out of his cell for a short

110
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,060
period in order to stretch his legs.

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,870
He was still confined to the jail house
and the door to the outside world was

112
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,860
security knocks,

113
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,140
but that was also a chimney.

114
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,590
Why does God was out of the room and
we've managed to squeeze this slight frame

115
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:40,801
up,

116
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:45,120
the suit covered escape hole and onto
the roof and then into the town plaza.

117
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,010
By the time it was discovered
that he had escaped,

118
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:52,011
he was free of silver city and en route
to Arizona carrying no food supplies and

119
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,221
without a horse.

120
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:57,180
Henry displayed an incredible physical
and mental strength in crossing the

121
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,890
desert plains of the southwest.

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,750
He quickly learns that
Hampton live off the land,

123
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:05,010
is foraging where he could
and steaming wearing must.

124
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,990
The 16 year old wanted fugitive,

125
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:11,850
made it across 500 miles of desert before
stumbling into a remote army outpost

126
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,960
in eastern Arizona.

127
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,120
Gold Camp grads here,

128
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,990
he managed to find employment as a
cook on a local ranch after hours.

129
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:22,470
He drifted to the local town where he
took the gambling and hustling in the

130
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:23,220
saloons,

131
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,030
the men and he was now associated with
included some hardened criminals and they

132
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,710
quickly showed him the ropes.

133
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,610
Before long,

134
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,250
he was participating in stealing horses

135
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,000
outside of his ranch duties and
isn't nefarious nighttime activities.

136
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:42,601
Young Henry,

137
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,600
it founds the time to perfect
his skills with a firearm.

138
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,650
He had managed to buy a revolver and
quickly discovered an innate ability to

139
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:50,400
wield it.

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,460
With this skill came instant
respect for those around him.

141
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,460
Within a year of escaping
the jail cell in silver city,

142
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,740
Henry had developed into a character
of note among the thugs in the Arizona

143
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,400
territory.

144
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,420
He wore a brightly colored scarf
around his neck and walks with the self

145
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,990
assuredness of a man many years
older than his only 17 years,

146
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,320
and it was at this time that people
will begin to call him the kid.

147
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,880
It was August the 17th,

148
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,320
18,

149
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,230
77 when the kid went from small
time crook to hardened killer.

150
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,400
The local blacksmith was a bully by the
name of Frank k hill on that nice while

151
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,280
drinking in a saloon.

152
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,860
Cahill had his sights set on Henry and
he was throwing insults at the kid when

153
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,630
the kid called him a son of a bitch.

154
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:29,891
Okay.

155
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,050
He'll jumped him and proceeded to
pounds him on the saloon floor.

156
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,640
Pins underneath the bigger man.

157
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,380
The kid managed to free his six shooter.

158
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,190
He shows cahill in the stomach and
then quickly it slid out from under him

159
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,720
leaving the blacksmith to die.

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,650
He hightailed it out of town on a stone
and horse and headed back to New Mexico.

161
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,140
Now I wanted fugitive
for the crime of murder.

162
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,930
The kid changed his name
to William h dot Bonnie.

163
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,910
He wandered across the vast open spaces
relying on the hospitality of Hispanic

164
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,420
ranches to provide him with a
meal or a place to lay his head.

165
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,390
Meanwhile,

166
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,980
New Mexico was being targeted by big
shot land speculators from back east.

167
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,050
They sold the mostly barren territory,

168
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,300
is a golden opportunity for speculation,

169
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,840
and they began buying up land
parcels from Hispanic settlers,

170
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,400
usually prices that were
manifestly unfair to the seller.

171
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,370
Those who didn't want to sell that lands
like they were going to find themselves

172
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,050
facing fondant prosecution.

173
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,220
Soon the eastern entrepreneurs had
wrested control of every industry in the

174
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:34,830
state from mining to the castle industry,

175
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,360
and even the railroads.

176
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,030
The largest county in
New Mexico was Lincoln,

177
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,940
which covered nearly a fifth
of the entire territory.

178
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,200
It was there in 18,

179
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:43,850
78.

180
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,180
There's a war broke out that would have
a profound effect on the remaining years

181
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,890
of beneath the kid's life.

182
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
In the late 18 sixties,

183
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:55,500
a couple of Irish immigrants by the names
of Lawrence Mathy and James Dolan has

184
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,450
bought up the majority of Lincoln County
and turned it into a huge cattle ranch.

185
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,830
They had secured extremely large
military contracts to supply beef to fort

186
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:06,960
stands in the Murphy Dolan monopoly,

187
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:11,410
and Lincoln County was called the house
and it was fiercely protected by battens

188
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,280
of thugs known as the seven rivers gang.

189
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,180
They operated from a huge wooden building
in the middle of the Lincoln township

190
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,820
and controlled every
business in town in 18,

191
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,481
77,

192
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:25,620
the house monopoly over Lincoln County
was challenged first in court and then on

193
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:30,160
the range by a Scottish born local
attorney by the name of Alexander Mcswain,

194
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,250
teaming up with a lie.

195
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,520
It was a 23 year old,

196
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:36,260
recently arrived at British
actress by the name of John Turn,

197
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,010
stall with a seemingly unending
supply of funds to the store,

198
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,440
was intent on creating his own
castle empire in the county.

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,460
In this quest,

200
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,750
he enjoyed the support of the most
successful and famous cattle baron in the

201
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:49,680
entire country.

202
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,390
John Chism tunstall began to recruit
employees not only to work the council,

203
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:58,500
but also the protection that he knew would
be needed when he came up against the

204
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,140
house.

205
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,570
What are you,

206
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,130
Bonnie?

207
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,860
In Lincoln County in mid 18,

208
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,840
77 and immediately proceeded to do what
he did best and that was steal horses in

209
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:07,500
short order.

210
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,390
He was caught and thrown in jail.

211
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,050
It just so happens that the man
he had been wrestling horses from.

212
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,501
Well,

213
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:17,380
that was John Tunstall when the Englishman
confronted the teenage outlaw and

214
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,150
they declined to press charges and steady
off of the kid a job as a member of

215
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,961
the regulators,

216
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,130
the team of cowboys,

217
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,510
that whereas protection squad,

218
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,230
billy,

219
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,220
he grabbed this off,

220
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:26,490
uh,

221
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,560
with both hands in Johnstown stole.

222
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,050
He had found a man who would
give them a fair break.

223
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,981
He said this,

224
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:33,530
if his employer Tom Stole,

225
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,290
was the only man who treated
me like I was decent on white.

226
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,490
The kid joins a group of men will older
than him as he learns the work of a

227
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,000
cowboy.

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,750
It was a long,

229
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,500
arduous,

230
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,030
often backbreaking work and they slept
sounds with the castle on the range for

231
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,260
the Betas of the house,

232
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:49,910
Muffy and,

233
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,510
and the idea of an upper crust Englishman
moving in on that territory was

234
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,240
thinkable like the kid's parents that
escape the famine back in Ireland and

235
00:09:57,241 --> 00:10:00,840
deeply resented the English over
their unwillingness to provide relief.

236
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,201
Now,

237
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:05,190
having found that new life in the new
world where they again to be plagued by

238
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,420
the power and the money
of the English well,

239
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,470
that's something that they
would never allow to happen.

240
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,610
Nothing and Dolan's power extended to
control of the legal system that Lincoln

241
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:15,780
county operated under.

242
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,150
They enlisted the aid of William Brady,

243
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,170
the corrupt sheriff,

244
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:23,430
to enforce a fake court
order that confiscated all
of the horses and cattle on

245
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,480
the ranch.

246
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,430
When tunstall received the demands,

247
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,090
he thought it was some kind of mistake
and proceeded to ride into town in order

248
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,700
to sort things out on the way there,

249
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:35,880
and he was met by the sheriff and a
policy of men on their way to execute the

250
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:36,714
court order.

251
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,200
Still thinking he could reason with
the Lumen to install road towards the

252
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:40,950
sheriff.

253
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,200
But before he got twice
members of the policy,

254
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,333
they shot him dead.

255
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,050
To add insult to injury,

256
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
they shot his horse to install.

257
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,200
His body was soon found by the men who
worked for him and taken back to his

258
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,130
ranch for burial.

259
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,630
Billy was incensed at the cold blooded
assassination of his boss and he,

260
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,940
along with a group of
hardcore other employees,

261
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,520
made a pact of vengeance
against the house.

262
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,660
They made it to the top of which
was the sheriff of Lincoln County.

263
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,170
William Brady Brady's ends
came on April fool's day.

264
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,630
18,

265
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,980
78 says he was taking his
morning stroll through Lincoln.

266
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,540
Billy and his fellow regulators were
lying in ambush and poured more than a

267
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,960
dozen bullets into his body during
the gunfight that ensued with Brady's

268
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:22,740
deputies.

269
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,110
Billy was shot in the
thigh three days later.

270
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:25,970
A shootout occurred.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,330
It blazes mill this time to have the
regulators were killed as a result of the

272
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,080
two incidents,

273
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,900
several murder warrants were
issued including one for billy.

274
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,890
The conflicts came to a head when
Alexander Mcqueen road from the ton store

275
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:42,120
ranch with between 50 and 60
regulators on July the 14th,

276
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,481
18,

277
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,290
68.

278
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,590
Some of the men's strategically positioned
themselves between buildings and on

279
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:48,450
rooftops while others including billy,

280
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,440
set themselves up in a house that belonged
to McSweeney for the next two days.

281
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,030
They waited on July the 16th.

282
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,630
The new sheriff George happens,

283
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,800
send some men to kill the regular
agency were stationed on the roof of the

284
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,330
saloon after one of them,

285
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,110
but was killed.

286
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,730
These men were forced to retreat.

287
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,330
Heaven.

288
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,960
Now send a message to fort stands
in requesting military assistance.

289
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,240
The request was initially turned down,

290
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:14,800
but the military bras changed their mind
the next day with that Nathan Dudley

291
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,620
road into town at the head
of a troop of soldiers,

292
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,440
a standoff in sued for a couple more days.

293
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,820
Then on Friday,

294
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:21,821
July,

295
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:22,654
the 19th,

296
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,160
all hell broke loose.

297
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,450
The regulators were now
all hold up in the house.

298
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,020
A massive barrage of firepower was
unleashed on this house with return fire

299
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,100
coming just as fiercely.

300
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,520
Then the house was set on fire
and then attempts to escape.

301
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:40,480
Alexander Mcswain was shot dead that he
managed to kill the man who had felled

302
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:44,470
mcswain before making good on his own
escape along with the other regulators.

303
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,951
Now,

304
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,750
just before we get into
the rest of billy's life,

305
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,710
I do want to take a moment to thank the
people who make this video possible and

306
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:51,550
that will be brilliant.

307
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,740
I know mid rollout is not
great for the story here,

308
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,910
but these videos are long,

309
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,630
so I do hope you appreciate our needs
to have sponsors to make them possible.

310
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,021
Brilliance.

311
00:12:59,021 --> 00:12:59,831
Our lending platform,

312
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,110
which teaches three something
called active learning,

313
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,250
unlike biographies,

314
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,890
which has done a nice way to
learn about people's lives,

315
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:06,730
learning about science.

316
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,563
It's a bit trickier.

317
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know if you've ever had to
sit down with a science textbook.

318
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,520
I have and I read them
in a whole lot of stuff.

319
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,354
That makes me think,

320
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,530
hold on a second and then you ended
up reading the page six times over and

321
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,550
you're still not taking it in.

322
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:18,971
Well,

323
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:19,391
brilliant.

324
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:21,550
Solves that problem with active learning,

325
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,031
brilliant.

326
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,590
Giving you something super short to read.

327
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:27,130
It's really easy and then you
immediately apply it to a problem.

328
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,610
The rinse and repeat that and suddenly
or understanding or sorts of stuff that

329
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,320
you really didn't think you'd be able to.

330
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,431
I've been using.

331
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,870
Brilliant and you should just go try it.

332
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:38,770
Just to see how easy it is to suddenly
be understanding all of these complex

333
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,311
subjects.

334
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,750
It's really brilliant.

335
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,250
Just make them super easy to grasp.

336
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,510
You can support biographics by going to
brilliant.org forward slash biographics,

337
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,610
and now let's get back to the kid.

338
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,570
Bye now developed into a seasoned killer.

339
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,200
He was now wanted for multiple counts
of murder in different jurisdictions.

340
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,650
Still,

341
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,700
he was able to find refuge with the
Hispanic sheepherders who viewed him as a

342
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:09,090
fighter for their liberty
against the Anglo robber barons.

343
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,110
The firestorm that had erupted in the
heart of Lincoln County forced authorities

344
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:16,980
to act in diamonds were issued for the
arrest of billion to other regulators for

345
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,640
the murder of sheriff braiding.

346
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,950
I knew governor of New Mexico territory
was also appointed the man given the job

347
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,000
was new wallace,

348
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:24,900
a format union,

349
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:28,040
army general and future
author of the Book Ben Hart,

350
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,590
Wallace that Alpha Lincoln County with
direct instructions from President

351
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,930
Rutherford b Hayes to restore order.

352
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,620
But while it's encountered a population
who were too terrifying to get involved

353
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:40,920
in so was unable to secure any witness
testimonies as to what had been

354
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,754
occurring,

355
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,310
that he received a letter
from a man calling himself,

356
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,180
William H,

357
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,930
Bonnie.

358
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,680
The kids offered to testify against
the members of the house in return for

359
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
philanthropists and swallows,

360
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,003
agreed,

361
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,340
believe,

362
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,510
testified before a grand jury with his
testimony leading do indictments against

363
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,400
a number of house members
including leader James Donut,

364
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,090
but he hadn't lived up
to his side of the deal,

365
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:06,470
but unfortunately the governor did not
live up to his skipping town before the

366
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:06,951
amnesty.

367
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,910
You could be formalized

368
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,090
with the governor gone.

369
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,340
Most of the indictments
against the house members,

370
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,170
they would drops,

371
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,680
but those against the regulators,

372
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,813
they remained,

373
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,920
believe fled town before
he could be arrested.

374
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,470
While the other regulars
fled in New Mexico territory,

375
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:29,940
billy decided to stay put and you can
also living as a council on Horse Rustler

376
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,000
over the next few months.

377
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,580
See arrestee ranches.

378
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,020
If the house empire and the
process becoming the most
wanted man in New Mexico,

379
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,370
the newspapers of New Mexico,

380
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,680
most of which were simply
mouthpieces for the house,

381
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,640
demonized the blaming him for every
misdeed in the territory in 18,

382
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:44,971
80,

383
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,200
the editor of the Las Vegas,

384
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,660
because that first names the outlawed,

385
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,470
believe the kids,

386
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,430
the name for which he would forever.

387
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,343
You know,

388
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,580
by the summer of 18,

389
00:15:58,581 --> 00:15:59,120
80 though,

390
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
he still rooms the territory.

391
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,720
Billy had made a base for
himself at Fort Sumner,

392
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,280
some 100 miles from Lincoln.

393
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:04,851
Why now?

394
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,860
Lincoln had a new sheriff and
his name was pat garrison.

395
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:12,110
He was single minded with his
obsession to capture billy the kid.

396
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,850
Garrett was a tenacious,

397
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:14,770
determined man.

398
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,930
He and his posse tractability and
his gang over the winter of 18,

399
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:22,220
82 of the outlaws were killed in a
shootout with the others being cornered in

400
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,690
cabinets,

401
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,410
a place called stinking springs.

402
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,160
After attempt standoff believe finally
came out with his hands in the APP.

403
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,030
The kid was transported by train to Santa
Fe and put on trial for the murder of

404
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:32,864
Sheriff Brady.

405
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,100
He was found guilty and sentenced to
death by hanging the next and supposedly

406
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,150
last stop was Lincoln where he was housed
in a second story room of the bank and

407
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,050
county courthouse.

408
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,200
It was there that he was to
wait for his date with the news,

409
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,520
but well billy,

410
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,860
he had other plans on April the 28th,

411
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,281
18,

412
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,750
81 in the early afternoon.

413
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:53,090
Billing told us God that
he needed to use the privy.

414
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,350
The guard escorted him in shackles to the
outhouse on the way back as he went up

415
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,340
the stairs to his room,

416
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:00,710
but he managed to slip out
of his hand and shackles.

417
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,480
He turns and wrestled with the gods,

418
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,800
managing to grab his gun.

419
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,790
The mountains tend to flee,

420
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,260
but believe shot him dead.

421
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,590
The kid then made for one of the rooms
in which he knew there was a shotgun.

422
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,550
Quickly loading it.

423
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,570
He ran through a window and looked
down on the street to see another God,

424
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,320
Bob [inaudible],

425
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,390
who had been eating his lunch across the
way comes from wanting to investigate.

426
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,750
Billy called out hello barb,

427
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,940
before blasting him with
both barrels with both gods,

428
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,271
dad,

429
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:23,570
billy.

430
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,800
Then race downstairs.

431
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,990
He commandeered a horse and was away,

432
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,160
but he's daring escape,

433
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,350
made them the most famous
outlaw in the country,

434
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,500
but it also made him a
three time cop killer.

435
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,080
This changed Garrett's mind now.

436
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,350
He wanted to hunt him down
and kill him despite this,

437
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,210
and he chose to remain in New Mexico.

438
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,350
The reason being is that he had fallen
in love with a 16 year old girl by the

439
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:48,020
name of polly to Maxwell back in Lincoln.

440
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,330
Garrett was receiving information
as to the whereabouts of the kit.

441
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,110
They were being supplied by the older
brother of police at peace maxwell who was

442
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,700
not happy about this romance.

443
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,480
He told Gary that billy
was in Fort Sumner.

444
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,480
Garrett finally moved on the intelligence
he stole into Fort Sumner on the

445
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,710
evening of July 14th,

446
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,990
1891 with two deputies alongside him.

447
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,680
They went straight to the home of the
maxwells posting the two deputies on the

448
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,260
front porch.

449
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,670
She entered the house from the back and
made for the bedroom of peet maxwell.

450
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,210
At this very moment that he was
approaching the porch in the dark,

451
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:22,650
he could only just make out the shape of
the two men there and he called out who

452
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:23,310
is it,

453
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,660
but there was no reply at this belly.

454
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,060
Cautiously backs through the open doorway
inside garrison maxwell were sitting

455
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,680
on the bed on seeing the figure.

456
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,700
Maxwell leaned over and
whispered to him garret levels,

457
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,590
his six shooter and fired.

458
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,150
Then either kids fell,

459
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,330
dad's never knowing who
had fired the fatal bullet,

460
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,760
so I really hope you found
