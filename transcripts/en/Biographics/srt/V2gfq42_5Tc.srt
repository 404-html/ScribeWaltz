1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,020
At the age of 16 he had a master
plan for becoming one of the best,

2
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:05,090
no generalists in all of Britain.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,160
He's been in the midst of media scandals.

4
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:10,790
He's interviewed some of the most
famous celebrities and most powerful

5
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,110
politicians in the world,

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,650
and he's judged the talents
of hundreds of common folks.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,580
Arrogance,

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,260
ambitious and shameless.

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,890
Well,

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,090
who is this media man?

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,480
Well,

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,820
of course it's none
other than Piers Morgan.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,793
Okay.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,061
He is.

15
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,710
Morgan was born in Sussex.

16
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:45,360
That's in England in 1965 to an Irish
dentist who unfortunately died when Morgan

17
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,410
was only two years old.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,260
Morgan was named peers.

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,811
Stephan,

20
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:49,710
Oh Mira.

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,070
But Morgan's mother remarried after
his father's death and Morgan,

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,550
he adopted the surname cute
Morgan Morgan and his stepfather.

23
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,790
They were pretty close and Morgan having
never really known as birth farmer

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,660
calls Him Dad,

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,381
his parents,

26
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,550
they weren't middle class English.

27
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,760
They ran a pub and they
supported Maggie Thatcher.

28
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,690
When Morgan was 13 years old,

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,270
the family could no longer afford
to send him to private school,

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,840
so he had to leave behind the classmates
that he knew that his new school,

31
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,110
well,

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,780
he was picked on and in
true schoolboy fashion,

33
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,680
the name Q,

34
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,450
well that was changed to puke.

35
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,410
They are hilarious,

36
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,250
aren't made Morgan,

37
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:21,031
as you probably know,

38
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,920
he dropped few from his name later on.

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,100
I believe that some have attributed to
a desire to separate from his middle

40
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:26,934
class roots.

41
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,480
That's that Morgan himself just said
was because p Morgan was too long for a

42
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,040
byline as a Charles Morgan.

43
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,790
He showed an early affinity for the media
as early as age seven he would sit at

44
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,830
the table devouring the daily newspapers,

45
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,890
reading the headlines and discussing
the day's events with his parents.

46
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,191
Now.

47
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,540
By the time he was a teenager,

48
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,370
he was already writing news articles,

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,240
even actually sold a piece to the mid
Sussex Times and then do cricket magazine

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,580
at the age of 2014 he said,

51
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:51,090
if this,

52
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,750
it gave me the real taste of
the excitement of a byline.

53
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,020
It's probably no surprise to youth and
that a couple of years later when it was

54
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,430
time for a career to happen,

55
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,870
Morgan had set his mind on the fact that
he would become the most famous media

56
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,760
personality in all of Britain.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,110
He developed this master plan and ops
is not to take an offer from Warrick

58
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:11,880
university to study history.

59
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,710
The reason for this was simply because
this would have kept his master plan or a

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
hold for a few years while
he completed his education.

61
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,450
So instead he went directly to Harlow
college and don't have it into the formal

62
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,580
study of journalism as soon as he could.

63
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,623
Okay.

64
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,480
Wilkins first formal journalism Gig,

65
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,420
was it the south London News and
then he joined the sun's right,

66
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,254
the gossip column,

67
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,240
which was entitled,

68
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,140
bizarre as The Guardian put it.

69
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,790
Morgan spent his years at the sun,

70
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,020
grinning in namely,

71
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,840
while posing next to a
succession of personalities.

72
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,660
He was,

73
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,710
wasn't disagree with the
Guardian's characterization.

74
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,900
It was an initial years in the
media as he himself told the BBC,

75
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:56,480
he made a point of putting
himself in the middle of stories,

76
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,970
posing for pictures with celebrities and
generally his name has face out there

77
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,130
for all of Britain.

78
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,060
And to see while this tactic,

79
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,170
it totally works.

80
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,320
By 1994 at the age of only 20 million
Morgan securities place in British media

81
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,110
history.

82
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,520
When Rupert Murdoch named him as editor
of the news of the world's Piers Morgan,

83
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,410
he was the youngest editor
ever of the news of the world.

84
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,450
And as the youngest editor of a
paper in Britain in five decades,

85
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,230
the news of the world had the largest
circulation of any paper in the country at

86
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:26,830
the time.

87
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,180
And the editor Shep gave Morgan a platform
in which to put his hard charging,

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,860
oft controversial journalistic methods
on display for a huge population of

89
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,180
readers even held reach,

90
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,790
the previously untouchable
barricade of the royal family.

91
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,930
By the summer of 1994 Princess Diana
and Prince Charles is marriage ed was on

92
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,160
its way to its official ends and
Oregon and the news of the welds.

93
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,740
They weren't going to miss out on the
opportunity to publish on potentially

94
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,180
juicy Ronald scandals.

95
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,200
Wolgan his court wins that James Hew
as an officer in the British military

96
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,550
wanted to spill the beans about his
affair with Princess Diana with no fear of

97
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,970
potential repercussion or for the long
held level of dignity with which the

98
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:04,960
roles had been treated.

99
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,560
Morgan reached down to it and
arranged to interview him for a story.

100
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,820
He and his associate,

101
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,570
they actually even bugs the room where
they did the interview so they would have

102
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,610
absolute proof of everything that was set.

103
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,780
Then leads to that year in the fall,

104
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,730
a book about Prince Charles
and his private life.

105
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,340
It was set to be published while the
news of the worlds that they didn't have

106
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,840
any excerpts the Sunday Times.

107
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,430
Totally did Morgan well.

108
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,180
He wasn't ready to give a scoop to another
paper and nausea willing to take no

109
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,570
as an answer when he was denied access
to information from the Sunday Times.

110
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,260
Instead,

111
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,080
he directed Rebecca back of Seward,

112
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,910
helps him out on the hotel
interview to disguise herself,

113
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,740
sneak into the Sunday Times officers,

114
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,850
grab a copy and get it back to the news
of the world as quickly as possible.

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,121
Well,

116
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,080
this a little bit of espionage.

117
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:44,950
It totally worked.

118
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,760
And the news of the world,

119
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,660
they were able to publish the story about
Diana and Charles all long before any

120
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,700
other paid the except
for the Sunday Times.

121
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,090
So if Piers Morgan wanted to
be a really famous journalists,

122
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,720
I mean why did he settle for running
gossipy relationship stories?

123
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,111
Well,

124
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,050
the answer was because to
him everything was news.

125
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,980
There is a type of snobbish pompous
journalist who thinks that the only news

126
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,990
that has any validity is war,

127
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,530
famine,

128
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,030
pestilence or politics.

129
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,100
I don't come from that school,

130
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,600
this egalitarian attitude.

131
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,780
It's allowed Morgan too quickly prove
as metal and his willingness to do

132
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:21,010
whatever it took to be
successful in breaking stories
that he only lasted at the

133
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,990
news of the world for a bit over a year.

134
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,840
Though Morgan said he left the
publication of his own accord.

135
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,920
The timing of his exec coincide with
the publication of a photo of Princess

136
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,650
Diana's sister in law leaving
and addiction treatment clinic.

137
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,510
The publication of which even Rupert
Murdoch said went too far now in 1995

138
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,310
shortly after this photo around Morgan,

139
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,270
he moved on to head up the mirror and
other paper roads by Rupert Murdoch here

140
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,040
has tenure.

141
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,420
It lasted much longer than it
did at the news of the world.

142
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,170
The number of controversial stories
though it was much larger than man as a

143
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:50,501
result,

144
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,730
his profile but continued to
rise even outside of Britain,

145
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,551
but it's true to form.

146
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:59,180
It only took a year before Morgan found
himself in his first major controversy

147
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,014
at the mirror.

148
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,290
The day before England was set to
play Germany and the euro 96 football

149
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,190
championships.

150
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,420
The Mirror ran a headline and the folks
when it's front page that many did not

151
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:12,870
find very amusing above a doctored image
of two players wearing world war two

152
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,040
helmets was the headliner act
will not surrender for you.

153
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:21,041
Fritz Zero 96 championship is over next
to it was a letter written by Morgan

154
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,390
himself in the style
of Neville Chamberlain.

155
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,590
Reportedly Morgan also plans a publicity
stunt than involved driving a tank to

156
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,490
the German embassy.

157
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,590
In the ensuing uproar about the headline,

158
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,640
well that lead to stunt,

159
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,140
it was subsequently canceled.

160
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,100
Suddenly though Morgan,

161
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,980
he found himself in this position
that is hard charging personality.

162
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,870
It didn't seem suited for you.

163
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,980
Got to apologize.

164
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,821
There were fears,

165
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,210
the kind of attitude you promoted by
the headlight made site acts of violence

166
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,970
during the games though Morgan,

167
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,060
he was apologizing.

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,510
He was still right where he wants it
to be and of course that would be the

169
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,560
center of attention.

170
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
In 2000 though,

171
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:56,720
the attention turns from an editorial
decision he had made to a more personal

172
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,720
financial scandal.

173
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,180
I can.

174
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,490
These in newspaper published the story
alleging that Morgan had bought 20,000

175
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:05,030
pounds worth of stock in a computer
company and that he had made the purchase

176
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,180
just before the mirror ran a piece naming
the stock as a good buy and inquiry

177
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,620
began and it was just to hit the wall and
Morgan had breached an ethical code of

178
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,340
conduct.

179
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,600
He could keep his job.

180
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,640
Other mirror employees,

181
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:15,801
well,

182
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,760
they weren't so lucky.

183
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,390
Economist,

184
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,680
so you wrote on stock vice,

185
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,400
they lost their jobs and it was another
four years before Morgan was cleared of

186
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,240
any wrongdoing.

187
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,781
However,

188
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,020
it actually came out later that he'd
bought additional stock under his wife's

189
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:30,890
name and another 70,000 pounds worth by
the time that that later revelation came

190
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:31,091
about,

191
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,530
it was Morgan was already
on the skids at the mirror.

192
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,130
I just said he had been leading the
charge against the Iraq war in the British

193
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:37,670
press,

194
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,360
undoubtedly criticizing then Prime
Minister Tony Blair for his support.

195
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:40,641
Supportive.

196
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:44,110
The ball among the story is published on
the war and the Morgans leadership was

197
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:48,410
a piece that included a photo of British
soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners.

198
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,950
As recently as eight 2016
BBC Interview Oregon,

199
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,430
he defended the photos seeing if they
were real and that the British government

200
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,710
had a vested interest
in getting rid of me.

201
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,930
Their biggest thorn in
the side about the war.

202
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,741
However,

203
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,190
the mirror,

204
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,580
it didn't defend them strongly in the
wake of the allegations that they were

205
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,450
actually fake.

206
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,081
The British people.

207
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:06,501
Instead,

208
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,960
they actually got a paper with a
large headline that that stage,

209
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,740
sorry,

210
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,780
we will host and then the man who had,

211
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,151
okay,

212
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:13,520
the publication of the photos,

213
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:13,970
well,

214
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,540
he was subsequently out of a job when
Morgan's firing was announced to staff

215
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,440
members at the paper.

216
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,750
They were in tears after nearly a decade.

217
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,700
Piers Morgan's reign of the Daily Mirror.

218
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,743
It was over.

219
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,183
Yeah,

220
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,130
free to form though.

221
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,160
He absolutely did not
slink away into the night.

222
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:37,791
Instead,

223
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,690
he became a regular feature on people's
TV screens that we had already been

224
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:44,330
appearing on TV before leaving
the newspaper business.

225
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,260
Morgan stepped up his involvement with
broadcast media after it's firing.

226
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,190
One of the first offers Morgan received
for a regular TV Gig was via a text

227
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:56,760
message from signing cow and then in 2000
and America welcomed Morgan into their

228
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,880
homes as he served as a judge
on America's got talent.

229
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,870
You also judge Britain's,

230
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,411
got talent,

231
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,670
and even appeared on the Venn,

232
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,301
just a mogul.

233
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:07,110
Donald trumps reality show the celebrity
apprentice Morgan actually won his

234
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,980
season of the celebrity apprentice and
in the process became close friends with

235
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,420
now President Donald Trump.

236
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,960
Orkin said all along that he believed to
Trump would be president and just being

237
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,440
outspoken about his dislike for the
protests that erupted after Trump's

238
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:19,890
election.

239
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,641
Interestingly,

240
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:24,330
Morgan style trines on the subject of
even that some celebrities do decline

241
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,164
interviews with him,

242
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,801
but Morgan,

243
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,780
he knew what opening
his mouth could lead to.

244
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,440
He's no stranger to the INS and outs
of the American political and media

245
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,274
institutions.

246
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,120
He served as the host of eight primetime
show on CNN for several years after

247
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,540
all.

248
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,410
So when Larry King announced his
retirement in 2010 Morgan was named as the

249
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:41,790
replacement for the long time.

250
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,140
My chronic American host,

251
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,800
the show,

252
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,190
it started strong with Morgan able to
book some of the biggest names in media

253
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,360
and politics for interviews.

254
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:48,991
Oprah,

255
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:49,824
Rudy Gilani,

256
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,401
Ricky Gervais',

257
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,211
Condoleezza Rice,

258
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,940
and even two of the con
ashy and sisters bands.

259
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:54,181
Well,

260
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:57,270
he made just as many headlines for
the interviews he didn't do as well.

261
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,230
Madano was deemed too old to appear on
his show and his bands from ever being a

262
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:01,860
guest,

263
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,390
but it's unfortunately for Morgan,

264
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,320
the initial hype,

265
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,310
it wore off quickly.

266
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,450
Morgan had a different style from king
and he was a British person taking over

267
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,010
in American news and interview show.

268
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,580
Ultimately he lost it.

269
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,540
Be Three years in the host
chair has poor ratings.

270
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,350
Student into failure is attributed to
the you failure to a clash of cultures

271
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,880
citing such factors as his own outspoken
opposition to guns as one such example

272
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,640
of cultural differences that
just couldn't be bridged.

273
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,150
The CNN show though it wasn't Morgan's
only projects during that time period.

274
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,880
It was also hosting life
stories for like TV,

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,540
who subjects were as diverse as
Sharon Osborne and the prime minister.

276
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,320
And now today he's the permanents cohost
for good morning Britain where he keeps

277
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,430
himself in the spotlight,

278
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,910
mostly recently sparring with a
gender fluid guest over the validity.

279
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:48,590
You have gender fluidity in this interview
and it's pretty classic blunt style.

280
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,950
Morgan,

281
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,290
ask the 21 year old guest if you can
identify as whoever the hell would you

282
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:52,710
like.

283
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,001
Come on.

284
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,960
You literally look at myself and say,

285
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,070
I'm an elephant today.

286
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,943
Yeah,

287
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,551
limits.

288
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:07,750
Does Reutens do television.

289
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,070
Stardom Morgan had to contend
with accusations dating
back to his newspaper days

290
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,080
80,005 the news of the world,

291
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,000
which remember Morgan
headed up for a year,

292
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,910
published a story about
Prince Harry injuring himself.

293
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,640
The only way that they could have
gotten the details for that story you've

294
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:25,090
claimed royal officials was if they
had hacked personal voicemails.

295
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,470
This set of a series of event,

296
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,610
the rocks of the British media,

297
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,300
political and celebrity world arrested
swim eight investigations were done.

298
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:35,770
Law seats were files and it took six
years before some actual action was taken

299
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,840
to address the phone hacking scandal,

300
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,670
river archaea.

301
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,550
She'd apologies for the phone hacking and
prince in the form of a full page ads.

302
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:44,290
In the last issue of
the news of the world,

303
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,251
Rebecca Brooks,

304
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,430
the same Rebecca who Morgan it used
to break into the Sunday Times office

305
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,880
resigned as CEO of news international
alter their resignation.

306
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,280
They more bad news is headed
because she was arrested,

307
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,810
but then she was released on bail.

308
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,100
The FBI then opens their own investigation
into the news of the world and the

309
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,130
allegations that they were hacking
the phones of nine 11 victims.

310
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,550
Indeed,

311
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,970
this scandal was so wide ranging that
even London's police department was

312
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:08,440
investigated for corruption.

313
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,700
Needless to say,

314
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,000
well,

315
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,631
the scandal,

316
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,620
it's totally envelop to England.

317
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,870
The wells,

318
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,230
it was paying attention though Morgan
had been out of the newspaper world for

319
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:17,831
some time.

320
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:20,170
He was not immune to being
questioned about the scandal.

321
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:20,771
In fact,

322
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,990
he had to answer questions
regarding to the voicemails.

323
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,090
If one of England's most famous personas,

324
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,430
so Paul Mccartney,

325
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,040
Mccartney,

326
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,791
his ex wife,

327
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,451
Heather Mills,

328
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:31,780
had alleged that her voicemails have
been listened to after she and Mccartney

329
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:36,781
had had a fight in 2001 a reporter who
called her just seem to know too much and

330
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:40,180
Mel's maintain that she hadn't shared
the voicemails with anyone else and that

331
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:41,980
she had actually deleted them all.

332
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,800
The only way the reporter could have
known so much was if he had hacked or

333
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,370
listen to the voicemails or talk to
someone who hat Morgan and it that he had

334
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:52,150
heard a message from Mccartney to mills
and as a result he was called to testify

335
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,730
and the 2011 inquiry into phone hacking,

336
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,300
Morgan wouldn't reveal how it come to
hear the message and he also maintains

337
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,550
that he never authorized the hacking of
voicemails or the news of the welds or

338
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:02,384
the Daily Mirror,

339
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,240
the head of the phone hacking inquiry,

340
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,600
Lord Levison Goldberg and his testimony
that he didn't know about the phone

341
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,750
hacking to be utterly
unpersuasive as well.

342
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:13,870
Despite his denials of direct
involvement in the hacking Morgan.

343
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:18,871
He was interviewed by the police about
the hacking in both 2013 and 2015

344
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,453
okay.

345
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,051
Phone hacking,

346
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,100
incendiary headlines,

347
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,780
taping interviews about the royals,

348
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,380
your might thing that would be enough
for any one person to face in the course

349
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,340
of a media career.

350
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,330
But Piers Morgan,

351
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:42,500
he has been embroiled in
personal controversy with
other celebrities as well.

352
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,260
One much publicized dramas,

353
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,150
diameter and action Morgan took
is the editor of the Daily Mirror.

354
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,710
He published photos of top gear host
Jeremy Clarkson with a woman who was not

355
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:52,544
his wife,

356
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,020
Clarkson and understandably was perturbed
by these photos being put out there

357
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,200
for all of the world to see.

358
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,400
So what did parks and do well and he
decided to her glass of water in Morgan's

359
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,850
face that's might not seem out
of place in your average bar.

360
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:05,511
That on board,

361
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,100
the last flight of the Conchords,

362
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,240
the alteration,

363
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,421
well,

364
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,540
it stood out and the fact
that it was between two,

365
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,740
you are highly visible
members of the British media.

366
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,160
We're all even better a
fuse between these two men.

367
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:16,610
Well,

368
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,590
it's officially started and this feud,

369
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,371
it wasn't minor thing.

370
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:23,930
It literally came to blows in 2004 when
Clarkson punched Morgan in the head at

371
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,430
the national press awards.

372
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,810
Parkson broke a finger.

373
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,750
Morgan gained discard ans
these celebrity gossip writers.

374
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:29,960
Well,

375
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,290
they gained a new story though
the views linger for a few years.

376
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:37,700
The two men were able to bond over drinks
in 2015 and while the feud end it at

377
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:38,061
the time,

378
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:41,480
Clarkson was going through a divorce
and confided about his travels to Morgan

379
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,980
who was able to empathize.

380
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,880
I sensed that Jeremy's just pretty much
like every other 50 something in life.

381
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,260
Angst-Ridden from damage,

382
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:49,071
relationships,

383
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:49,491
grieving,

384
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:50,140
loved ones,

385
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,630
irritated by work issues
and battling in a demons.

386
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,610
Okay,

387
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,510
well at the time he entered his fifties
Morgan was acquainted with many of the

388
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:09,390
same trials and tribulations
that Clarkson had dealt with.

389
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,200
His own marriage fell apart by the mid
two thousands when he had his first wife

390
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:18,060
and married and shallow
officially divorced in 2008
after 27 years of marriage,

391
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,810
the marriage,

392
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,680
it produced three sons and Morgan makes
a point of staying in close contact with

393
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:23,310
his children.

394
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:23,761
In fact,

395
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:25,620
amidst all of the demands on his time,

396
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,430
Oregon has made a point of speaking
to his children every single day.

397
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,020
Often is divorce Morgan.

398
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,690
He began dating Celia walls
in a fellow journalist,

399
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,560
the couple the married in 2010 and
years later they had a daughter.

400
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,970
They both are British.

401
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,240
They now primarily reside in New York.

402
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,420
Walden often shares details
of their married life in
her columns and Morgan even

403
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:48,960
joins in some of the time the team even
teams up to write a column about a trip

404
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:52,740
to Paris in which Morgan steps back
from his desire to be known by everyone.

405
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,860
Ferris has always been one of my favorite
cities because the French neither knew

406
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,390
who I am nor camp.

407
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,590
This means I can behave in
a wildly reckless manner
and to maintain a reasonable

408
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:05,340
confidence that the shameful images
will never appear on the cover of the

409
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:06,450
national enquirer.

410
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,440
Though he claims he doesn't
want his own personal shame.

411
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:20,880
Shout in the national enquirer,

412
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,140
Morgan has made a career out of sharing
the intimate details of other people's

413
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:25,680
lives.

414
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,980
He's never been shy about sharing his
political opinions or any opinions.

415
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,390
He's made a name for himself.

416
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,040
He's made a few enemies along the way
and shows absolutely no sign of stepping

417
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,930
out of the spotlight anytime soon.

418
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,310
From Middleclass Sussex.

419
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,410
Do you have a TV sets of
people around the wells?

420
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
Here's Morgan has lived out the plan.

421
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:47,040
He wrote it at the age of 17 and he's
still got plenty of Korea and left to go.

422
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,470
What will the world see
next from Piers Morgan?

423
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,951
Well,

424
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:50,910
whatever it is,

425
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,780
when it happens,

426
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,380
well,

427
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,450
we'll surely see it in the news.

428
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,250
So that was piers Morgan his life.

429
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,180
Well so far.
