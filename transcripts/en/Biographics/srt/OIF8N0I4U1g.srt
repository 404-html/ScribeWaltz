1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,470
Christopher Lee is most familiar to the
wells, is a consummate actor with a deep,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,100
rich voice and a towering
presence in 1,000 studios films.

3
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:11,030
He became the embodiment of
evil inhabiting the character
of Counter Von Dracula

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,670
with a sinister charm.
Then breaking the mold.

5
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:18,110
He went on to play some of the most iconic
characters in cinematic history. Yes.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,150
Who would have known that the great
character actor was a former world war two

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,990
RF intelligence officer
and his Nazi hunter,

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,610
who had been a witness to unspeakable
atrocities. In this week's biographics,

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,720
we piss the seller Lloyd to
discover the Real Christopher Lee

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,550
Christopher Frank.
Karen Deany.

11
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,570
Lee was born on May the 27th
of 1922 in Belgravia in London.

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,830
His father Jeffrey,

13
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,790
was a hero of the first world war having
been decorated for gallantry at the

14
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,890
battle of the Somme.
At the time of his son's bath,

15
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:04,800
he was a left colonel on
the kings royal rifle court.

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,120
Jeffrey was married to an Italian
countess by the name of Sdl Marie.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,710
Blessed with great beauty.

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,890
Estelle's heritage traced all the way
back to Emperor Charlemagne as a result of

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,750
the household was frequently visitors
by high ranking figures of European

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,350
nobility and as the young Christopher
that came into contact with some very

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,420
interesting and important people.

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,980
Christopher was the second child's where
the sisters Zandra having been born in

23
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,140
1917 however,
the marriage,

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,440
it was not a happy one and it's when
the boy was just four years old.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,230
His parents separated
for the next two years.

26
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,900
The children lived with our
style and Wengen Switzerland.

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,800
While father remained in the
Belgravia house often two years,

28
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:47,300
the marriage officially ended.
One in Switzerland are still enrolled.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,220
Her son in a preschool
called Miss Fisher's academy,

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,900
which was located in terror attacks.

31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,980
It was here that Christopher was given
his first acting role appearing as the

32
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,530
lead character in the
play Rumpelstiltskin.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,560
In 1928 a stolen the
children returned to England.

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,290
Christopher was put into Agnes
private school in Queen's gate.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,500
London in 1929 is still married a
banker by the name of hardcore George,

36
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:08,920
Syncrude.

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,680
Rose Lee's step father happens to be
the uncle of a young writer named Ian

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,490
Fleming who would go on to create
not only James Bonds but also bonds,

39
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,324
arch nemesis,

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,010
scaramanga or the man with the golden
gun who would the would famously play on

41
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,130
film a half century later
following the marriage,

42
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,710
the family moved to full
on at the age of nine,

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,070
Christopher was enrolled at summer fields,
a boarding school in Oxford.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,760
They enjoyed his time at some airfields
and quickly made friends and proved

45
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,130
himself to be a gifted
and studious people.

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,210
Among his closest friends at summer
fields was Patrick McNee who would also

47
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,660
carve a career as an axa and
find fame as secret agents.

48
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,940
John Steed in the Avengers,
the ends,

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,060
McKinney both enjoyed acting and
it appeared in a number of school.

50
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:55,140
Plays together some of the fields once
a feeding school to Eton College and in

51
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,070
1935 Christopher sent the scholarship
exam and was interviewed by the school.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,010
How are they as math disability let him
down and he missed out on a scholarship

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,690
by one place. If he was to attend eaten,
his family would have to pay his way.

54
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,410
Despite his mother's urgings, his
stepfather was unwilling to foot the bill,

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,950
so I ended up at Wellington College
in Berkshire. It was at Wellington.

56
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,640
There's lead proved himself to be a
brilliant linguist. He mastered French,

57
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:22,240
Spanish, Italian, and German,
and he's gained a passing
knowledge of Swedish, Greek,

58
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:25,060
and Russian.
Yet despite his academic prowess,

59
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,600
he chafed under the harsh discipline
that was meted out at the school.

60
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,170
He hated the irregular parades and
weapons training that became more and more

61
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,800
regular as talk of war became more
frequent in political circles.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,410
So it was with some relief that he had
to leave Wellington when his stepfather

63
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,680
went bankrupt in 1939

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,990
the 17 year old's education was over.

65
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,420
It was now expected to make
his own way in the worlds,

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,500
but he entered the job markets just as
the summer holidays were beginning and

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,620
they wouldn't know prospects.
After a month of fruitless job hunting,

68
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,700
he was allowance to join his sister who
was on holiday on the French Riviera.

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,600
While there the heard news that the last
public execution in France was to take

70
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,090
place in Paris along
with thousands of others.

71
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,030
He took the trip to witness the
grease from events from Paris.

72
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:19,250
He traveled to mentor in Southern France.

73
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,210
There he stayed with an exile
Russian principally family
with ties to his mother.

74
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,760
He enjoyed his time
there and wanted to stay,

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,280
but with Europe about
to erupt into warfare.

76
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,090
It was decided that it would be better
off back in the relative safety of London

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,880
for a short time. He worked as a
clinic and a shipping line office.

78
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,410
When war broke out in September of 1939
league was eager to do his part too

79
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:40,820
young to join the regular army.

80
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:44,430
He teamed up with some friends
and traveled to Finland
with plans to fight aside

81
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,640
the fins in their struggle against Russia.

82
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,760
The British teens may have
had a lot of fighting spirit,

83
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,710
but none of them knew how to ski,

84
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,550
which rendered them virtually useless
in the snow covered battles terrain.

85
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,130
They were politely thanks for their
assistance and then strongly encouraged to

86
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,250
to returns to England back in London.

87
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,810
Lee resumed his work as an office guy
in 1940 at the age of 18 he joined the

88
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:09,350
home guard. It was around this
time that his father Jeffrey died,

89
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,440
though we had great respect for
his father's wartime endeavors.

90
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,490
Christopher had no desire to follow his
footsteps into the regular army knowing

91
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,620
that conscription was not far away.

92
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,000
He decided to enter the armed
services on his times. Consequently,

93
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,730
he volunteered to fight
in the Royal Air Force

94
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,710
following his initial training.

95
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:41,640
They were stations to southern Rhodesia
on the brink of his first solo flying

96
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,370
mission. He complains of
blackouts and blurred vision.

97
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,750
He was diagnosed with a failed optic
nerve and told that he would never fly

98
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,310
again for a number of months.

99
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:52,950
He was transferred around
the RAF service in Africa,

100
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,340
but given nothing meaningful to do.
Then out of frustration,

101
00:05:56,341 --> 00:06:00,260
he applied to ref intelligence
service gaining entry to the service.

102
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:03,470
He was posted as a water to the
Salisbury prison in Rhodesia.

103
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,740
From that he was moved to the Suez
Canal zone where he was put to work and

104
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,070
intelligence gathering activities
during the north African campaign.

105
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,100
He was deeply involved as part of number
260 Squadron Raf nearly losing his life

106
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,240
when an airfield was destroyed by a
German bombing rate in the winter of 1943

107
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,120
and he was part of an office swap
and he was succonded to the army.

108
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,310
He spent the next year serving with the
gawkers of the eighth Indian Infantry

109
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,520
Division.

110
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,690
He saw action in the battle
of Monte Cassino almost
losing his life when a plane

111
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,680
crashed on takeoff.

112
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Towards the end of 1944 he was promoted
to flight leftenants and it's posted to

113
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,210
air force HQ when the ends of hostilities
finally came in April of 1945 he was

114
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,690
given a position in the central registry
of war criminals of security suspects.

115
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,180
He had become essentially a Nazi hunter.

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Her work was top secret and we have a few
specifics about what he did in a later

117
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,870
interview. However, he did see this.

118
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,870
We were given dossiers of what
they're done and told to find them,

119
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:03,410
interrogate them as much as we could
then hand them over to the appropriate

120
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,130
authority. We saw these concentration
camps. Some had been cleaned up,

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,133
some are not.

122
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,670
They left the army in 1946 after what
he had experienced over the previous few

123
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,160
years. He could no longer bring
himself to work in an office.

124
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,190
You had the opportunity to
teach classics at university,

125
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,320
but didn't fancy that prospect either.

126
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,780
Unsure what to make of
his post military life.

127
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:37,350
The 24 year old founders himself dining
at the Italian embassy in London with

128
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:41,220
his cousin, the Italian ambassador
to England, Niccolo Karen Deni.

129
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,920
Also if the Blue Karen
Deni looked at me and said,

130
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,330
have you ever thought of being an actor
taking a little off guard by this?

131
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,410
Be Replies, no way, don't think
so. Karen Deany then replies,

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,220
perhaps when you go away you might want
to think about it. Let's think about it.

133
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,120
He did. He decided that he quite likes
the idea and mentioned it to his mother.

134
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,450
The Countess has, however,
was vehemently opposed.

135
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,190
A career in acting was beneath
this status. She implored
and besides it six feet,

136
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,630
five he was too tall.

137
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,500
It was also to foreign looking and
it was hardly a steady line of work,

138
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,780
but the more she railed
against the acting idea,

139
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,560
the more her son became determined
to make a success of it.

140
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,150
Towards the end of 1946 he joins the
rank of company of Youth and the next few

141
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,640
years he busied himself
learning the craft of acting.

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,840
He swept to the first stage [inaudible]
prompts cards for the actors on the

143
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,800
stage and eventually got tiny parts
himself. Then came small roles in films.

144
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,250
It's high.

145
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,880
Did indeed work against him with casting
directors struggling to find a place

146
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,190
fan. However, the roles did come.

147
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,090
Director's managed to find creative ways
to hide his height such as having him

148
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,440
sit during his scenes.

149
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Some of his roles in these
early years where and creditors,

150
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,840
while others ended up on
the cutting room floor,

151
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,920
but they all added to the skills that
he would display when the big roles

152
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,450
eventually came around.

153
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,730
In 1957 Lee was hired by hammer film
productions for his biggest part,

154
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,470
yet he was to play the monster
created by Baron von Frankenstein,

155
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,410
who was to be played by his
good friend Peter Cushing.

156
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,190
The movie goals of a castle
of Frankenstein founds any
immediate audience among

157
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:27,890
the lovers of horror who clamored for
more hammer decided to satisfy the demand

158
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:31,820
with a cinematic take on the Bram Stoker
Classic Dracula with the d and the lead

159
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:36,380
role. The movie released in 1958 was
a huge hit within these sinister,

160
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:40,550
yes charming take on the fanged account
forever embedding itself in the Public

161
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,080
Consciousness Dracula.

162
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,250
That was the movie that
turns the struggling 36 year
old journeyman actor into a

163
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,820
star he laid to recalls. It's
brought me a name, a fan club,

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,030
and a secondhand car for
all of which I was grateful.

165
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,660
The Dracula movie was both a
blessing and a curse. Philly.

166
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,770
It's inevitably at typecast him and
tied him to a peer and a succession of

167
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,290
sequels,
each one worse than the last.

168
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,310
When he tried to bring the series
to an ends, he was in his own words,

169
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,510
black males by hammer executives who
would remind him how many people and he

170
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,450
would put out on the street if
the next movie it was not made.

171
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,680
Lee Played The parts of Dracula 10
times and increasingly grew tired of the

172
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:20,420
shadow that it cost over is Korea.

173
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,240
It took eight years for the
Second Dracula to be released.

174
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,990
By which time the first movie had made
a tremendous impact all over the world.

175
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,470
Yes, when Lee was handed the script
for the SQL, he was horrified,

176
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,560
not spoiling the murderous things
that his character was asked to do,

177
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,220
but by the terrible dialogue that
he had been given. As a result,

178
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:41,390
he refused to do the lines, which is
why Dracula does not say a single word.

179
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,570
In 1965 is Dracula prince of darkness,

180
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,920
and he was also concerned
that the character of Dracula,

181
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:49,400
it was getting further and
further away from water.

182
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:52,310
Bram stoker had in mind
when he wrote the book.

183
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,200
According to the man himself,

184
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:08,370
Lee's real career as a serious actor
started when he was cast as the mucky to

185
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:13,371
sad and a tale of two cities in 1958
this was in fact his 43rd movie.

186
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,330
Other the serious roles follows,

187
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,750
but he was unable to escape the
horror genre for over a decade.

188
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,360
Appearing in a slew of largely forgettable
blood and guts flicks both for hammer

189
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,380
studios and other production companies.

190
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,080
In 1962 Leo auditioned for
a role in the World War II.

191
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:30,630
You classic the longest date.

192
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,590
It is ironic that despite
his distinguished service
for his country during the

193
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,340
actual war,

194
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,030
he was turned down because it was felt
that audiences wouldn't accept him as a

195
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,660
military type from 1965 until 1969 leave,

196
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:46,410
despite his obvious English bearing
start in a series of movies in which he

197
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,290
played the villainess Oriental Fu Manchu.

198
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,530
His skill as an accident along with long
hours in the makeup chair allows him to

199
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:56,110
breathe life into the role
of the criminal masterminds.

200
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,860
In 1917 Lee picks up a single day's
work as the narrator in a film about the

201
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,250
market you decide in titled Eugenie.

202
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,040
It was only when the movie was released
that he realized he was appearing in a

203
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,790
soft porn film loaded with sex scenes
that were shot when he wasn't around.

204
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,420
He was embarrassed and he was angry,
but he couldn't really do much about it.

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,290
Leed credits his role as Sherlock Holmes
is smarter older brother Minecraft in

206
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,520
the 1970s movie,

207
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,120
the private life of Sherlock Holmes as
the role that allows him to finally break

208
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:25,930
free from being typecast as the
horror guy. Three years later,

209
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:30,090
he played Lord Summer Aisle in what is
considered the best movie ever made that

210
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:30,810
wicker man,

211
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,870
but he was so taken with the book of well
upon which the movie is based that he

212
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,820
offered his services free of charge.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,510
The film has become a cult classic and
it is considered one of the best British

214
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,590
movies ever made in the mid
1970 [inaudible] and Lee
appeared as cob to rush for

215
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,200
in the three musketeers and did sequel.
The four musketeers.

216
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,243
During the fight scene,

217
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,880
he received a knee injury which would
play again for the rest of his life back

218
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:55,510
in the early sixties Lee's stamp cards
in the in Fleming who had made it big as

219
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:58,990
an author but offered him the role of
the villainous title character in the

220
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:02,110
movie adaptation of is James
Bond's novel. Doctor. No.

221
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,150
Lee accepted the role on the spot.
However,

222
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,870
Fleming had and clearly with the producers
and they had already chosen their man.

223
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,890
It doesn't.
Years later,

224
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,240
they finally got his chance when he
landed the role of Francisco Scaramanga in

225
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,880
the 10th bond film,
the man with the Golden Gun,

226
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,190
Lee breathe life into
this character as well,

227
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,600
who Fleming had written as a rather
bland bad guy lacking any real depth.

228
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,960
The writer was delighted
with the portrayal claiming
that Lee had created the

229
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,080
sinister counterpart to James Bond.

230
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,543
Yeah.

231
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,380
By 1977 Lee had established a reputation
as a fine actor who could take on any

232
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:46,520
role and to make it his own.
Still.

233
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,860
He was concerned that if
he remains in England,

234
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,400
he would eventually be lured back
into the dark tunnel of horror movies.

235
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,380
Avoiding that fate was the
prime motivation for his
move to the United States in

236
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:59,810
1977 his first American role,

237
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:03,860
it was a departure from anything that
had gone before the modern day disaster.

238
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,900
Apple 77 the following year,

239
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:09,650
he went even further beyond his comfort
zone and appeared as the guest host on

240
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,110
NBC live comedy show Saturday night live.

241
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,460
He remembered the experience as the most
terrifying hour and a half of his life

242
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,870
that night though he impressed many
people including budding director Steven

243
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,300
Spielberg, who promptly signed
him up for his next project,

244
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,850
the period comedy in 1941 they had the
chance to follow up with another comedy,

245
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:30,830
a spoof of airports.
77 gold airplane.

246
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,430
Bowtie turned the role down
and do went to Leslie Nielsen.

247
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,240
Lee would later refer to this decision
as a big mistake through the 1980s and

248
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:40,580
nineties near peers in a
broad spectrum of movies,

249
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:43,310
genres from dramas to
comedies and even musicals.

250
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,940
He also made regular appearances on
the small screen for both British and

251
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:50,120
American television
audiences in 1998 and he was,

252
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,640
controversially is Muhammad Ali Jinnah,

253
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,860
the founder of Pakistan
in the movie Jenna,

254
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,270
it was to be his most demanding role
and the one that carried the most

255
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:01,220
responsibility for 10 weeks.

256
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,960
He acted the part of the father of the
Pakistani nation on location as thousands

257
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,420
of local scrutinized his every move.

258
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,320
The vast majority of them were
won over by the consummate actor,

259
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,440
amazed and delighted with
his ability to become Gina.

260
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,480
The movie was hugely important to Lee,

261
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,810
but it did not achieve
widespread commercial success.

262
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,850
Leah been a lifelong fan
of the j r r Tolkien,

263
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,730
Lord of the rings series of books,
reading the manually.

264
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,930
He had once actually met talking and for
decades had harbored the desire to play

265
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:42,980
the role of Gandalf.

266
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,540
What he was offered and immediately
accepted was the part of ceremony in the

267
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,260
trilogy to be directed by New
Zealand director Peter Jackson.

268
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,010
The role of brought him to
a new generation of fans
who were in thrilled with

269
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,450
his commanding performance.

270
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,460
Those who were privileged
to work with him on the set.

271
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,340
We're also captivated by the
Christopher the aura. In one scene,

272
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:04,880
it Sarah man was to be stabbed in the
back and director Jackson coach lead to

273
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,560
scream as the blade entered his body,

274
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,550
Lee turned to Jackson and asked him if
it ever actually seen a man get stabbed

275
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:14,480
in the back. Jackson admitted that
he hadn't to which Lee said, well,

276
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,340
I have and I know what to do.

277
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,280
He went on to explain that such
a wound would puncture the lungs,

278
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,470
preventing the person from screening.
Ah,

279
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,250
it's best they would basically lists
out a quiet grown with this revelation.

280
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,170
The set went quiet.
All present,

281
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:30,800
knew that they were in the presence of
a man who had lived through things that

282
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:31,880
they could only imagine.

283
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,660
The success of the Lord
of the rings movies led to
Lee's insertion into the star

284
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,830
wars franchise where he plays the evil
counts Dukie throughout the 2000 he also

285
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,660
appeared in a string of Tim Burton movies,

286
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:45,620
including sleepy hollow and Sweeney to
onto the demon barber of fleet street.

287
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,880
In 2011 Lee embraced his roots by
appearing in his first hammer film in 35

288
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:04,730
years. The residents along with
Hilary Swank while filming in Mexico,

289
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,120
he suffered a back injury and tap
to undergo surgery. As a result,

290
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:11,420

the long awaited sequel to the wicked

291
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,790
man entitles the wicker tree.
However,

292
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,630
he wants to time institute appear in the
film and was given a small role as the

293
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,550
mentor of the character
he was meant to play.

294
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,900
Although in his late eighties Lee was
insistent that he had no intentions of

295

retiring from acting.

296
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,420
He often said that making movies had
never been a job to him. It was his life.

297
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,680
It gave him meaning and it gave him
purpose with respiratory problems and

298
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,090
[inaudible]. He couldn't accept as many
roles as he added in earlier days. Still,

299
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,810
he was kept busy with voiceover work
and his narration work and at least one

300
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,220
major production each year.

301
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,540
His final movie was an independent
production called angels. If nothing hill.

302
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,530

2015 at the age of 93 the official
