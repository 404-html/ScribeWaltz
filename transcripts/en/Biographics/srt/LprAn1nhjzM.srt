This video is made possible by Vince.

00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:06,480

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:11,874
on them in a bit.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,403
Yeah.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,510
During the 13th century and merchants
named Marco Polo returns home to Italy

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,010
after spending 24 years living
in the Mongolian empire,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,580
he had the bad luck of getting arrested
in Genoa while they were at war with his

9
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,720
hometown of Venice.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,410
He was a prisoner for two years and he
just happened to share his cell with a

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,980
famous writer named [inaudible] Piza.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,150
The two of them shared
stories with one another.

13
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:43,810
As you do when you're stuck in a
prison cell with absolutely no form of

14
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:44,644
entertainment.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,510
Rista Jello was so captivated by the
stories of Markopolos Jannie this he knew

16
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:51,010
that it would make a great book.

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,790
So they spent those two years in
captivity writing the manuscript together.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,080
When they were released from prison,

19
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:58,450
they published the travels
of Marco Polo Mens.

20
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,490
It became an overnight best seller.

21
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,220
Marco Polo became the first
Europeans in documents.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,030
So many details about the
Mongolian and Chinese empires.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,630
The Western world had a difficult time
believing that it was possible that there

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,310
could be a civilization now there that
was actually more advanced than theirs is

25
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:15,791
stories.

26
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,840
They were so fantastic that people assumed
that it was a work of fiction for the

27
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:22,420
rest of his life. Marco
Polo, he was called a liar.

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,500
It would take hundreds of years before
the world would know that every single

29
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:30,700
story he told was absolutely true and yes,
even today,

30
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:34,750
there are some skeptics who find it hard
to believe that one man could have seen

31
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,970
and done so much in his lifetime,

32
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,090
but he has still gone down in history as
being one of the greatest explorers in

33
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,084
the world.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,440
Marco Polo was born into a wealthy
Venetian family in the year 1254 it was

35
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:56,740
expected to follow the family trade
of becoming a merchant's. His father,

36
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,090
Niccolo and his uncle mafia were
traveling most of Marco's young life.

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,350
I like a normal job. Merchants
were expected to leave
home for years at a time.

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,220
They traveled the world as they
gathered popular items like spices,

39
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:13,390
pals and goals and gemstones that
were plentiful in certain countries.

40
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,510
They then sold these goods in other
countries where they were more valuable.

41
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,590
They would earn enough money to last for
years and then again set out on a new

42
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:21,170
journey,

43
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,370
but that's how I'm travelers would return
to Europe claiming that they had seen

44
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:27,130
amazing creatures in the Far East.
Many of these,

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,690
they weren't complete works of fiction.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,990
There were stories about a
country full of human dog hybrids,

47
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:35,150
fire breathing dragons,
and mystical unicorns.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,560
Christians believes that the garden of
Eden was somewhere the hemorrhaging in

49
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:43,120
the Middle East and Jerusalem was
located in the exact center of the world.

50
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,720
A lot of people either fully believed
these fairy tales or trays to take

51
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,070
everything with a grain of salt.

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,370
There any people who knew the truth
about what when's on in foreign countries

53
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,420
were the ones who had seen these places
with their own eyes at a time when

54
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:59,220
traveling man going on a journey that
requires ceiling walking or horseback

55
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,970
riding. People could only go so far before
they ran out of money, food, and water.

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,420
So the only people who really
traveled the world with the merchants,

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,860
they had generations of the family's maps
and personal experiences behind them.

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,460
It took an entire lifetime
to write half of the journey.

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,070
Marco Polo grew up learning to read,
write,

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,160
and speak multiple languages while
his father and uncle were gone.

61
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,370
His mother passed away and he
spends a lot of his time at home,

62
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,660
eagerly waiting for his father and uncles
to return so that they could go on an

63
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,740
adventure together. By the
time Nickelodeon's, Matthew
finally resigned to Venice.

64
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,390
Marco Polo was 15 years old.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,780
They told the boy that they had spent
several years in Constantinople before

66
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,590
finding themselves ushered into China.
At the heart of the Mongolian empire,

67
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,710
the leader could Bly.

68
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:45,880
Khan was interested in meeting them
because they'd never seen European men

69
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:46,390
before.

70
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,260
The con was impressed by their ability
to read and write in so many languages

71
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,390
and he believed that they
could be very useful to him.

72
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,770
The Polo brothers were treated as esteemed
guests and they were given luxuries

73
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,270
beyond their wildest dreams.

74
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,900
He asked them to resend to Italy
on a mission to meet with the pope,

75
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,100
could blown colon had requested for the
Podo brothers to bring back 100 priests.

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,040
The Mongolian Empire.
Kublai Khan was a Buddhist,

77
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,740
but he was very accepting of
all cultures and religions.

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,430
He wants to Christians to come into
his empire to help diversify academic

79
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,160
knowledge of the kingdom.
Unfortunately for the Polos,

80
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:21,790
they returned to find that the Vatican
was arguing over who would become the

81
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,400
next pope.

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,650
Niccolo Ans Mofo brought back golden
gemstones there were hidden in the lining

83
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:30,160
of their clothes and they were able to
sell them for a small fortune for two

84
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,740
years.
They prepare tax returns,

85
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,080
Mongolia and taught Marco all about
what to expect on the journey.

86
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,550
Without the help of the pipe,

87
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,130
they could only convince to
priests to come with them.

88
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,630
When Marco was 17 his father and uncle
packed up the caravan and so they set off

89
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:48,190
on a journey across the lands that
would take them a full three years.

90
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,650
Traveling from Italy to
China was no small task.

91
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,990
The polos had plans to take a boat there,

92
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:02,660
but they realize this
after years of being away,

93
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:06,470
the families share but fallen
into disrepair and that
would be no way for them

94
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,500
to sail.
They had no choice but to go on foot.

95
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,150
If they went straight through the desert,

96
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,130
they would never make it so
they had to go on a journey.

97
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:16,850
Where they were able to stop at small
cities and OAC is along the way.

98
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,720
They would have taken camels, horses
and donkeys to help carry the supplies.

99
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,470
They aged dried meat and drank water
and once they reached a town or city,

100
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:28,520
they would barter with their goods to
trade for fresh fruits and vegetables in

101
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,320
the marketplaces.
All along the way,

102
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,800
they carried goods that they could
sell for a profit in the next country.

103
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,550
The journey would have been exhausting
and they would have been exposed to

104
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:38,480
brutal elements,

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,590
but there were also countless numbers of
bandits waiting to steal from traveling

106
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,450
caravans. Marco Polo matches the Tata
who are known to kill men without mercy,

107
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,620
but the Polo family was gifted with
golden passports which provided them

108
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:54,480
protection from the great con.
It was written this,

109
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,540
if anyone were to mess with the Polos,

110
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,480
they would have to face the
wrath of comms and tire.

111
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,170
Army because of this he never mentioned
is going through many hardships during

112
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,780
that journey except for the
fact that the two priests,

113
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,040
somebody couldn't handle it.

114
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,790
They were forced to turn back and returned
to a city department is not to cross

115
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,700
over the permia mountains
in South Central Asia.

116
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,390
He describes the basic colds and tell
that funds were never as hard as they were

117
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,020
back home.

118
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,770
The next big challenge was the Gobi
desert where they periodically came across

119
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:25,190
the scatter dozens of dead animals and
humans who had not survive the harsh

120
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,070
conditions.
He often heard the singing sand dunes.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,730
He described as just sounding
like different instruments
playing all at once and

122
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,910
sometimes it sounded like the
dunes where we're spring, his name,

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,430
it was enough to drive a mad Matt.

124
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,730
There was stories of men wandering into
the desert to try and find the source of

125
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,850
the music, but they never
returns. Now this story,

126
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:48,740
Trudy does sound supernatural because
it was as if some vengeful spirit was

127
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,210
trying to love men into the deserts, but
this is actually a very real phenomenon.

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,930
These musical notes come from the sounds
of vibrations of sen sliding down the

129
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,840
dunes that play the musical notes,
g e orF ,

130
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,380
which some people have described
as sounding similar to a cello.

131
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,450
Once market Podo reached China,

132
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,870
he became very ill and was afraid
that he might actually die,

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,500
but he founds mountains that were said
to have magical healing powers and he

134
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:16,790
climbs the mountain, breathe in the fresh
and ruins founds. Trudy did heal him.

135
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,840
He read that into batch.

136
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,230
Parents wanted their daughters to have
sex with as many men as possible before

137
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:25,100
they got married so that they could prove
how desirable they would be as wives

138
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,750
as he was a young European men.

139
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:30,680
These patterns where practically throwing
their daughters at mt have a foreigner

140
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:31,071
review.

141
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,550
That daughter's sexual
abilities he mentioned is that
Tibet was a great place to

142
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,730
be for a boy who was 70 to 20 years olds.
Of course,

143
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,330
this story goes to a bit of controversy
and it was one of the many examples of

144
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:44,690
the stories that people found is
too far fetched to believe bus.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,810
It is actually based on a real custom.
Now,

146
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:50,060
just before we get into the second topic,
today's video,

147
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,190
let me tell you a bit about Vince.
Sarah watches,

148
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm wearing one of these
watches right now. This is,

149
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,650
I've been Sarah chronic off as
well as keeping perfect time.

150
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,060
It's also got a timer and these three
back doll's hair that ain't just look

151
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,640
great.
They also serve that time a function.

152
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,120
Now I picked out a watch from the area
with a blue and silver combination,

153
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,970
but there are loads of different
options on their website.

154
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,230
You're sure to find something that suits
your style and also they'll accommodate

155
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,650
your risk size.
I have small wrists a say.

156
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:23,510
They managed to get me a smaller watch,
which is fantastic. It fits great on me.

157
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:23,811
Now.

158
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:28,580
I've put this watch through its paces
and it's still looking as good as the day

159
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,940
I got it. Super durable. The watch
itself also, if the leather strap,

160
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,070
in fact the leather
strap doesn't look new,

161
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:38,180
it kind of has that nice age leather look.
It gets a little bit softer,

162
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,060
a little bit better. I really
like that Nevin. Sarah watches.

163
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,240
They believe that luxury isn't
about price, so specification,

164
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:47,540
it's about detail and craftsmanship
and Vin. Zara watches.

165
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,810
They've got a ton of that.
Unlike many other watches on the market,

166
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,440
this isn't about minimalist style. You've
seen those watches. This isn't that.

167
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,120
It's more about the classic look of a
good watch further by selling direct to

168
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:04,470
the consumer of INSERRA can deliver a
great watch for a much better price than

169
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,430
you might expect.

Thanks to Sarah Watches for
sponsoring and let's get back to it.

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,130
Years Before Marco Polo
was born, a powerful leader
named to Gingiss con United,

174
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:32,420
the Mongolian Empire. Once all of the
Mongol tribes were led by a single leader,

175
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:36,290
they began to conquer surrounding
territories in Asia, eastern Europe,

176
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,303
and the Middle East.

177
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,210
Mongolian worriers what trains since
they were toddlers to ride on horseback.

178
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,300
As the men's spends their entire
lives preparing her vassal,

179
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,750
they simply had the strongest army in
the world with millions of soldiers

180
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:50,540
prepared to fight for the con.
In each new generation,

181
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,650
the strongest dad was chosen to be the
new con Malkai Podo and his family.

182
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,630
They were keen to see Kublai Khan,

183
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:01,460
who was arguably one of the greatest
rulers the empire had ever seen off to

184
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:04,820
traveling or the 10,000 miles.
Marco Knicker, Loewen's mafia,

185
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,760
polo all arrived Kublai Khan,
some a palace.

186
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,640
They were all greeted as
esteemed royal guests.

187
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,790
Even though he had heard so many
stories from his father and uncle,

188
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,940
it could never compare to
experiencing the real thing.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Marco Polo was completely blown away
by the wealth and magnificence of the

190
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,490
Mongolian empire.

191
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,020
The palace was massive and it had its
own park with lush gardens and exotic

192
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:29,210
species of animals living on the lands.

193
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,290
Even in the 12 hundreds the Chinese had
advanced systems of heating and cooling.

194
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,050
This had never seen in
Europe pipes in the ground.

195
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,880
He took the polished hardwood floors,

196
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:41,390
which captured the royal court warm and
the winds are engineers have constructed

197
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,250
impressive buildings and bridges.

198
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,640
Further vet sanitation systems
were also years ahead of Europe.

199
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,380
Everyone was clean,
they smell good,

200
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,640
and they dressed in luxurious silk
robes shimmering with golden threats.

201
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,810
For Marco Polo, it was like he has
simply died and gone to happen.

202
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,780
The colon through a celebration
for the Polo family's arrival,

203
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,340
and then they had a huge feast.

204
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,260
They fetch over 40,000 guests and Marco
Polo could fill this cup with unlimited

205
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,780
drinks from a massive
silver wine fountain.

206
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,890
He was incredibly impressed with Kublai
Khan polo look time to him with an

207
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:16,790
almost godlike reverends because it
was an example of the perfect ruler.

208
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,660
The grade column has incredible skill
and battle like his ancestors before him,

209
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:24,500
but he was also educated and level
headed when it came to making diplomatic

210
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:28,430
decisions. Instead of attempting to rule
every single country that he conquered,

211
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:32,180
Kublai Khan allowed existing government
structures to continue functioning on

212
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:32,571
their own,

213
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:36,560
so long as they agreed to bow down to
the con and pledged their allegiance to

214
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:37,730
the Mongolian empire.

215
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,630
This means that every territory was
allowed to keep their religions,

216
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,740
their languages, and their culture.
Kublai Khan, he's celebrated diversity,

217
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:49,940
and he believes that one day the Mongolian
empire would spread across the entire

218
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,020
planet.
Because of this,

219
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:55,120
it was very important to have advisors
like Podo family and his courts to help

220
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:59,220
him negotiate with foreign nations.
Marco Polo became one of Kubler icons,

221
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,310
trusted advisors,

222
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,790
and he was able to live among the
royal court since he could speak five

223
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,240
languages. He was very useful
in diplomacy and negotiations.

224
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,340
He was eventually trusted to be in
charge of the Mongolian salt straightens

225
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,330
broker deals for sending the minerals
to other lands at that time. Salts.

226
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,850
It was incredibly valuable even though
it was relatively easy to produce.

227
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,940
He described in great detail about how
the workers made sold from boiling sea

228
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:24,520
water in giant Vats,

229
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:28,030
which is a technique that is
still used in China today.

230
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,890
Along with all of these responsibilities,

231
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:34,030
Marco Polo was announced to enjoy all of
the best entertainment that the empire

232
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,910
to offer. There were musical
performances, horse races,

233
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,860
this Aaron's wrestling matches.

234
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,710
Men of high standing were allowed
to have their own harm as well.

235
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,710
The most beautiful women in the
empire were all brought to the palace.

236
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,130
He wrote about how for women were skilled
and playing musical instruments and

237
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:50,320
how they were all graceful and polite.

238
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,490
Keep in minds that he was just 20 years
old when he arrived and he had already

239
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:58,330
had so much experience being the most
popular guy in Tibet during his journey to

240
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:00,460
China.
While it's not included in his book,

241
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,700
there is one Chinese court record from
that time that is believed to be about

242
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,534
Marco Polo.

243
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,380
A foreign man was arrested because he
was walking with a woman alone at night

244
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,210
without an escort.
This was illegal,

245
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,700
but the young man was totally
unaware of the Lawrence.

246
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,030
He had diplomatic immunity,
so they simply let him go,

247
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,060
but not all of the wind in the Mongolian
empire where there for the men's

248
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:22,120
entertainments,
Marco Polo witnessed Kublai Khan's knees.

249
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:25,210
Princess could a union battle for her
right to choose their own husbands.

250
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,330
She set out to challenge that if any
man could defeat her in wrestling,

251
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,090
they would win a hand in
marriage. However, no one
was ever able to defeat her.

252
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:36,730
Ng acquired a massive
fleet of 10,000 horses.

253
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,020
She was allowed to remain unmarried and
fought alongside a father and battle

254
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,510
even without polos helped
keep her memory alive.

255
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,200
Could a human story was so incredible
that it has been passed down by word of

256
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,420
mouth in China for hundreds of years.

257
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,450
It's Colin's believed that the polos
would have been afraid of what would have

258
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,810
happened to them after [inaudible]
Khan's death. Since they were foreigners,

259
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,070
not official citizens of the empire,

260
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,540
they may not have had the same rights
and privileges. Once he passed away.

261
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,500
They claimed that they were homesick
and humbly requested to return to Italy.

262
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,740
The condo, you found them very useful and
at first he didn't want to see them go,

263
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,130
but eventually he relented saying that
they could leave as long as they escorted

264
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,640
a woman named Princess Kaka Chins
and meet her new husband in Persia.

265
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,870
She was also called the blue princess
and she was remembered for her legendary

266
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,440
beauty this time. They did not have to go
through the harsh mountains and desert.

267
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,890
They were able to take and boat departure,
but over 100 people,

268
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,130
they died on the journey.
Only 18 survived,

269
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,120
including the polos and the princess.
By the time he returned to Wesley.

270
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:44,170
Marco Polo had been gone for 24 years
and he was a bachelor in his forties

271
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,060
during the war between Genoa and Venice,

272
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,870
Marco Polo was arrested and the government
illegally seized the majority of his

273
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:52,130
wealth that he had
acquired in his time away.

274
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,520
He was able to hide some
of his golden gem stones,

275
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,020
but he was Trudy lucky that
his book was a best seller,

276
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,950
otherwise he may have ended up
broke after all of those years away.

277
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,120
As we mentioned before, mocket, they told
these stories to wrist of cello and yes,

278
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,780
he never describes himself
very much of his personal life.

279
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,950
Throughout the entire book,

280
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,640
Maka Paleo is acting more like a
journalist or a non biased observer.

281
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,380
He pauses no personal judgements,

282
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,580
and d simply explains the things that
he was seeing. In a very matter of fact,

283
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:23,810
way off to publishing the travels of
Marco Polo, the author got mixed reviews.

284
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,980
Some people congratulated him for his
accomplishments while others accused him

285
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,090
of being a liar.

286
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,470
Many of the stories challenged Christian
beliefs about the outside wells and by

287
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,191
comparison,

288
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:38,210
the Mongolian Empire seemed superior to
Europe and the number of ways they were

289
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,970
wealthy. They were powerful,
well educated, open minded,

290
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:43,010
and said the strongest army in the world.

291
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,330
These stories made some Europeans feel
inadequate by comparison and they clung

292
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:50,150
onto that ethnocentric worldview.
In modern times,

293
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,080
scholars have poured over the original
manuscript of Margaret Polos books and

294
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,140
comparative to details of
ancient Chinese documents.

295
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,830
They were able to confirm nearly
every detail be incorrect,

296
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:04,850
which proves that he was telling the
truth or the long for the rest of his life

297
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:08,360
market. Pilate tried to ignore the
haters and he went on living his life.

298
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,020
He got married to a Phoenician noble women
and they had three daughters together

299
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,150
and the records of his
oldest daughter's dowry.

300
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,690
It was documented that he passed on the
golden passport that he received from

301
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:22,520
the con [inaudible] 24 Marco Polo was on
his deathbed surrounded by his family.

302
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,050
A priest showed up to meet him,

303
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:27,950
his last rites and the urge to Polo to
confess if he had Trudy lied about his

304
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,130
stories as a way of convincing his soul,
his dying words,

305
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:35,060
whether it's the only told a fraction
of all the stories about his amazing

306
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,300
experiences, and if he had given
away all of the stories in the book,

307
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,590
it would blow everyone's minds and no one
would have believed to many way as the

308
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,560
years went on, there would be several
new additions of market ponos books.

309
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,190
Priests rewrote his stories with a
Christian slant so that they could bolster

310
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,270
Europe superiority.

311
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,240
They highlighted session stories like
the women in Tibet as examples of the

312
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,880
sinfulness and depravity.

313
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,200
They still could not stand the idea
that China was just somehow better than

314
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,430
Europe.
Unfortunately,

315
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:04,910
the future generations would see this
altered manuscripts and take it as a sign

316
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:08,720
that white people needed to reform it.
Foreign natives with Christianity,

317
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,190
future explorers like Christopher
Columbus used the salted Veshon of mocket

318
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,890
paradise book as a guide for his own
journey. However, the often got it wrong,

319
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:19,160
believing that they had landed in an
entirely different country without the

320
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,330
ability to speak the language.

321
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:24,440
Columbus assumes that he had landed in
India and immediately set out to enslave

322
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,280
the native people.

323
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,060
They called an eye as the
Lens for conquest and greed
rather than attempting to

324
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,810
assimilate or understands the native
American language and culture.

325
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,030
Now people love the story of Marco Polo,

326
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:37,400
but no one truly knows
what he looks like there.

327
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:41,720
Are there any artists interpretations
of how they imagined him even though he

328
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:45,470
had so many stories to tell?
We knew very little about the actual man.

329
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,930
We don't even really know what
he did on a day to day basis,

330
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,010
so anything about his,

331
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,560
despite the fact that we know so
little about who he truly was,

332
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,980
he is still considered to be one of
the most admired people in history,

333
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,510
not just for his discoveries,

334
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,390
but because he lived his
life to the fullest extent.

335
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,080
He was able to experience seeing a new
world that was unlike anything that

336
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,460
Europe had ever seen before,

337
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:09,840
and he became the real life hero of
every story about that one special person

338
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:12,030
who is invited to a magical wells.

339
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,120
And that in a way is
what dreams are made of.

340
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
