1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,060
Born a slave,

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,160
he rose to become a
prominence abolitionist,

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,910
statesmen,

4
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,870
author and respected figure around
the world the most photographed

5
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,790
african-american of the 19th century.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,770
He was also a recognizable figure even
as his very identity put him at risk for

7
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:15,700
much of his life.

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,940
Frederick Douglass story
is one of perseverance,

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,690
intellects,

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,440
and then an unending desire
for freedom and justice.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,360
Frederick Douglas wasn't
born with that name,

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,380
noisy born on the day that he later
adopted as his best date of birth.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,270
He was christened Frederick Augustus,

14
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:48,440
Washington Bailey.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,870
The date he was born has
been lost to history.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,951
Later in life.

17
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,730
You decided that February the 14th
would be the day on which he marked his

18
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,050
entrance into the wells.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,740
He said,

20
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,540
I have no accurate knowledge of my age,

21
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,530
never having seen any authentic record
containing this is what he wrote in a

22
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,720
narrative of the life
of Frederick Douglass.

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,830
We do know though that Douglass was born
into slavery in Marilyn's likely the

24
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,500
son of a union between
his mother and that owner,

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,021
Douglass.

26
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,430
His mother was known for her intelligence
and is widely considered to be the

27
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:20,960
only slave who could read or write in
the area of Maryland's where she lived,

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,240
but was never really
got to know his mother.

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,630
It was common for infants born to slaves
to be separated from their mothers.

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,620
Soon after birth.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,460
Taking care of children took up energy
and time that the younger women could use

32
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:34,100
to doing hard work on the
farm or the plantation.

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,910
Older women who weren't able to do such
physical neighbor could take care of

34
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:41,450
children and slave masters wouldn't
see a drop in productivity.

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,410
So Douglas,

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,460
like many slaves,

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,840
he grew up without his mother.

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,210
He was sent to live with his
grandmother that he bailey.

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,140
She was also the caretaker for
12 other children don't miss.

40
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:53,210
His mother was enslaved at
a different plantation here.

41
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,020
And you saw how a handful of times before
he was removed from his grandmother's

42
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,820
house at around age seven,

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,420
Douglas was separated from the family
that he knew he was taken from his

44
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:06,410
grandmother's home and was sent
to y plantation plantation.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,440
He joined a thousand other slaves spread
across 20 farms owned bite master Lloyd

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,590
Douglas.

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,570
He didn't work in the fields.

48
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,650
He was still young and
so he didn't go out.

49
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,460
Instead,

50
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,360
you cared for the families,

51
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,330
cows and tended to the
houses garden and it's yacht.

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,960
It was while he was at this farm that
his mother died and then once again,

53
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,880
ductless was operated as a slave.

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,450
Douglass was forced to move and
serve the winds of his masters.

55
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,870
This time he was sent to Baltimore
to the family of Hugh old here.

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,900
Douglas followed in
his mother's footsteps.

57
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,810
He learns to read and write
is journey to literacy.

58
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:39,950
It started when Sophia,

59
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,190
old Hugh's wife again teaching
him the lessons of the alphabet.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,950
It was unusual for a slave owner.

61
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:49,670
It's takes so much interest
in the education of a safe
and he did not like that.

62
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,000
His wife was doing site plus
all sorts that have slaves,

63
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:56,420
could read and write so they would be
more likely to want their freedom and more

64
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,800
likely to seek it out.

65
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,490
Douglas called all those
arguments against literacy.

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,790
His first decidedly anti slavery lecture.

67
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,871
Unfortunately,

68
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:08,140
Sophia came around to her husband's
way of thinking and Douglas is tutoring

69
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,974
sessions.

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,960
They came to an end,

71
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,700
but douglass believed that
once you learn to read,

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,290
you will be forever free,

73
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,850
and so he kept that name.

74
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,990
He taught himself to read,

75
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,150
grabbing any publication
that had words on it.

76
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,360
Newspapers and political pamphlets
joins books in his collection,

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,420
and Douglas began to learn
much more than how to read.

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,650
He was learning about the events of
the country and the rest of the world.

79
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,830
Among the publications he devoured
was the Colombian or race.

80
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,940
At this book was an 18th century
unfollow gig that was used as a literacy

81
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,040
teaching tool in classrooms for Douglas.

82
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,310
Though the book offered more than
just a lesson in reading and writing,

83
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,340
it gave him an insight
into ideas about freedom.

84
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,600
It's about human rights was he didn't
want to keep the power of literacy to

85
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:50,021
himself.

86
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,980
Though he started teaching other slaves
from nearby plantations to read during

87
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,110
Sunday school using the New Testament's,

88
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,960
dozens of slaves would
show up each week to learn.

89
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,290
Amazingly just went unnoticed
for nearly six months,

90
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,530
but when it was discovered that Douglas
was teaching fellow slaves to read and

91
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,040
write,

92
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,380
the slave owners were beside
themselves with anger.

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,190
One Sunday while Douglas was teaching
ve fuming owners bust into the makeshift

94
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:12,760
school,

95
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,880
they were intense that they're slaves
would not learn to read and write,

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,460
and they use violence to
get that point across.

97
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,160
They used stones and clubs to ends
that Sunday meeting and to end Dr says

98
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,340
teaching for the time.

99
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,120
Being.

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,020
Douglas was still a
teenager when this happened,

101
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,620
since he was already beginning
to make his mark on the world.

102
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,540
By the time Douglas had his teens,

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,010
he had also been moved from owner to
owner and plantation to plantation.

104
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,080
Several times in his late teens,

105
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,720
Douglas were sent to be
a slave for Edward Coby,

106
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,610
coby subjected to violence regularly
beating and whipping him and his book,

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,140
my bondage and my freedom.

108
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,970
Douglas entitles the chapter devoted to
his time on covese plantation as Colby,

109
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
the Negro breaker.

110
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,490
He rides if the beatings,

111
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,030
he sustained it covese hands.

112
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,630
I had not been in his possession
three whole days before.

113
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,590
You subjected me to almost brutal
chastisements onto his heavy blows.

114
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,280
Blood flowed freely and Wales will left
on my back as large as my middle finger.

115
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,360
The sores on my back from this flogging
continued for weeks for they were kept

116
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:14,080
open by the rough and coarse
cloth which I wore for shouting.

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,390
Eventually Douglass began to fight back.

118
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,220
He gave covey a taste of his own medicine,

119
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,700
and the man never tried to use
violence to control douglas game,

120
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,553
Douglas Near.

121
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,010
He couldn't continue life as a slave
beyond his own beliefs and desire for

122
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,460
freedom.

123
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,820
He had also met a woman who inspired
him to seek his own freedom,

124
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,190
and Maria was a free black
woman from Baltimore.

125
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,320
She not only inspire to douglass freedom,

126
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,700
but fell in love with him.

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,630
The two of them,

128
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,850
they later got married in 1836.

129
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,130
Douglas first attempted
to escape from slavery.

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,420
When his plan was discovered,

131
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,530
he was thrown in jail,

132
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,830
return to his own head.

133
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,340
Douglas remained a slave for two more
years before he able to make another

134
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:58,731
escape.

135
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,320
Attempts on September the third,

136
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,681
18,

137
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,310
38,

138
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,480
Douglas took the risk that he knew could
either start his life as a free man or

139
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,830
end it altogether.

140
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,550
I felt assured that if I failed in this
attempt to my case would be a hopeless

141
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:10,910
one.

142
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,490
It would seal my fate as a slave forever.

143
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,640
He later wrote he had obtained
papers showing him to be a free man,

144
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,170
a risky move in and of itself.

145
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,520
The neighbors belonged to a black sailor
and so douglas hats to act the part if

146
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,270
he wanted to be successful before leaving
his master's property in Baltimore.

147
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,520
Doesn't this costumed
himself in a red shirt,

148
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,570
black revamps and the sales hat while
he disguised himself with his clothes.

149
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,030
The plan still had one big floor.

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,270
Douglas wasn't a great physical match
for the description on the haters.

151
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,720
If an official stopped to closely consider
the measurements and the description

152
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,740
is journey to freedom,

153
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,893
it would be over.

154
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,070
Douglas boarded a train to Philadelphia,

155
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,060
and as expected,

156
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,180
he faced an inspection when he
was asked to show free papers.

157
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,970
Douglas handed over his sailors
identification and said,

158
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,490
I never carry my free
papers to see with me.

159
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,450
I have a paper with the American Eagle
on us that will carry me around the

160
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,180
world.

161
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,450
The answer and the papers
were enough for the conductor.

162
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,600
Douglas was free to stay on the
train and to continue his journey,

163
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,850
but he still had to make
it through slave states.

164
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,790
When he risked getting arrested
after an anxious journey,

165
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,940
Douglas stepped off the train in New
York and made his way to a group of

166
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,770
underground railroad activists.

167
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,970
He was in a free state,

168
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,200
but it was not a free man.

169
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,580
He was technically a fugitive,

170
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,050
so could still be arrested.

171
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,690
The danger was definitely
not over for him yet.

172
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,470
Nevertheless,

173
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,620
he was ecstatic to simply be
in one of these free states.

174
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,370
I've often been asked how I felt when
first I found myself on free soil.

175
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,340
There is scarcity.

176
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,350
Anything in my experience about which
I could not give a more satisfactory

177
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,750
answer and new world had opened upon me,

178
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,820
if life is more than breath ends,

179
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,170
the quick rounds of blood.

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,830
I lived more in one day and
then a year of my slave life.

181
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
It was a time of Jonah's excitement,

182
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,860
which words can,

183
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,190
but team the describe the underground
railroad activists provided them shelter

184
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:56,510
for a day and got words to his
beloved Anna that he was free.

185
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,870
She made her way up for Baltimore
and the two were married in New York.

186
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,290
Within days there a couple of world
further north to Massachusetts where life

187
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,220
was somewhat safer for a fugitive
slave that was still prejudice.

188
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:07,581
However,

189
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:11,180
in Douglas had to work hard to find even
the menial jobs where you could earn a

190
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,720
living.

191
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,553
While in new Bedford.

192
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,390
Douglas became a licensed preacher.

193
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,450
Auntie taught Sunday school
and served as church sexton.

194
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,390
They also became involved in
the abolitionist movements.

195
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,190
Douglas was inspired by abolitionist.

196
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:24,920
William Lloyd Garrison and
avidly read his newspaper,

197
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,873
the liberator.

198
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,970
The first time Douglas was asked to
speak as an abolitionist meeting.

199
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,863
He was frightened.

200
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,800
He had been unexpectedly asked to give a
speech at the Massachusetts antislavery

201
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,360
societies national convention.

202
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,980
Through his nervousness,

203
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,710
he gave an incredibly eloquent
and thoughtful speech,

204
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,280
unlikely white abolitionists who
gave most antislavery speeches.

205
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,510
Douglas could speak personally about
the pain and the brutality of slavery,

206
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,403
douglass skill,

207
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,981
public speaking.

208
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,760
It was quickly noticed and he talks more
and more at antislavery meetings and

209
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,530
soon he was a key part of
the abolitionist movements.

210
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,101
At meetings,

211
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,500
he would tell his story and
rouse crowds to the course.

212
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,101
In 18,

213
00:08:59,101 --> 00:08:59,730
43,

214
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,720
he joins the American antislavery society
to toward the midwestern United States

215
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,810
and speak about the importance
of abolishing slavery.

216
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,870
They traveled for six months
spreading their message,

217
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,660
and in doing so often
putting themselves in danger.

218
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,440
This was two decades before the civil
war and slavery supporters wanted to make

219
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,340
themselves heard.

220
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,140
They turns violence on some occasions,

221
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:23,100
and Douglas had his hands broken during
one melly and Indiana Douglas didn't

222
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:26,070
just put his oratory skills to
work for the abolitionist movement.

223
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,890
Though he also wrote his autobiography,

224
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,620
telling the story of what it was
like to grow up and if a slave titled

225
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Narrative,

226
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
the autobiography of Frederick Douglass,

227
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,760
the book was a huge success.

228
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,660
It had nine reprinting and was translated
so that it can be sold in Europe as

229
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:40,380
well.

230
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,450
The success of the book
that came with a cost,

231
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:46,200
though it attracted attention to Douglas
and he was still not a free man in the

232
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,034
eyes of the law.

233
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,320
Instead of going into
hiding in the United States,

234
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,910
though Douglas headed to Europe,

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,390
that he was safe from arrest and could
continue spreading his message and

236
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:55,290
telling his story.

237
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,450
During a two year tour
of England and Ireland,

238
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:00,000
he raised his profile both
back home and in Europe.

239
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,020
Crowds came to see him
speak and some twists.

240
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:03,850
His appeal that is European support it.

241
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:06,390
It's began raising money to
buy his freedom in America.

242
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,310
Douglas was also impressed with Europe.

243
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,660
He was treated like a person.

244
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,470
They're unlike.

245
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,080
He wasn't home instead of
a democratic governments.

246
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,790
I'm under a monarchical governments.

247
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,010
Instead of the bright
blue skies of America,

248
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,830
I'm covered with a softer
gray fog of the emerald aisle.

249
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,450
I breathe hands low.

250
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,800
The Chattel becomes a man I gave around
in vain for one who will question my

251
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:26,760
equal humanity,

252
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,490
claimed me as a slave
or offer me an insult.

253
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,450
I find myself regarded and treated at
every turn with the kindness and deference

254
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,500
paid to white people,

255
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,550
and I go to church.

256
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,140
I'm met by no upturns,

257
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:40,460
nose and scornful lip to tell
me we don't sell our niggas.

258
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,430
Yeah.

259
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,030
His supporters were successful in raising
the funds to buy douglass his freedom,

260
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,100
and he was able to return to America,

261
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,000
to his wife,

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,090
and to the course of freeing the
millions of slaves in the country.

263
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,920
He started publishing his own paper,

264
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:53,754
the North Star,

265
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,600
and also took up causes of freedom
beyond the abolitionist movements.

266
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,860
He spoke at the women's rights,

267
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:02,010
Seneca falls convention calling for
women to be granted the right to vote.

268
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,550
He also became active in cooling
for the desegregation of schools.

269
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,640
This is a full century before Brown and
board of education was decided by the

270
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,603
Supreme Court

271
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,480
because of his activism and this
perpetual presence in the abolitionist and

272
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,314
other movements,

273
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,000
Douglas was a highly recognized figure
in America when the civil war began

274
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,900
during the walk.

275
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,950
Douglas is a fierce advocate of allowing
African Americans to fight for the

276
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:34,550
union.

277
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,570
A war undertaken and brazenly carried
for the petrol enslavement of the colored

278
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:43,190
man calls logically and loudly for
the colored men to help suppress it.

279
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,610
Douglas even have the ear of Abraham
Lincoln and was able to speak to the

280
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,490
president about his views
on African American troops.

281
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,070
He used his publications and speeches
to call for the inclusion of African

282
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,260
Americans in the army for two years.

283
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,850
He kept working on this issue.

284
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,511
In 18,

285
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,140
63,

286
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,340
lincoln issued the emancipation
proclamation as African
Americans were free to

287
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,090
join the army.

288
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,240
Douglas and his family were ready
to have a son signed up to fight.

289
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,280
Under third became active in recruitments.

290
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,180
Douglas himself shifted his message from
encouraging the inclusion of African

291
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,860
Americans in the military to encouraging
African Americans to sign up to fight.

292
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,180
When time sample Carson and shall fall
upon our national tragedy than hillsides

293
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:22,781
and valleys,

294
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:26,590
johnny the red and with the bloods nor
Weisen with the bones of Kensington and

295
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,250
countrymen who have fallen in
the sanguinary ans wicked strife.

296
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,280
When grim massaged war has moved
his wrinkled front and our country,

297
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:38,170
you shall have regained its normal
condition as a leader of nations in the

298
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:42,760
occupation and blessings of peace and
history shall record the names of heroes

299
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,750
and martyrs who bravely answered the
call of patriotism and liberty against

300
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,950
traitors thieves and assassins it.

301
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,000
Nobody said this in the long
list of glory composed of men,

302
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:52,900
of all nations,

303
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,750
there appears the name of no colored man.

304
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,310
When the civil war ended,

305
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,480
slavery was outlawed.

306
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,970
Douglas did not step
away from public life.

307
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,660
He believed that was still much work
to be done in the fight for freedom.

308
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,000
He was appointed president
if the Freedman's bank,

309
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:10,180
which helped promote economic development
in the newly free African American

310
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,630
communities and also continued speaking
around the country and was active in

311
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,760
supporting ulysses s grant 18,

312
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,440
68 campaign for the presidency.

313
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,340
Then in 18,

314
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:19,030
72,

315
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,180
douglas was nominated
as Victoria woodhull,

316
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,750
his vice presidential running mate.

317
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,400
He didn't even know it had been nominated.

318
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,360
He didn't seek it out,

319
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,710
but the equal rights party,

320
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,450
but in one of the tickets nonetheless,

321
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,700
it wouldn't be as lost appearance
in a presidential race.

322
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,151
In 18,

323
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:31,541
88,

324
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,350
he became the first African American to
receive a vote for presidents as a major

325
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,430
party's convention.

326
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,270
His fame and his outspoken activism
still made him a target for sinister

327
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:40,751
activities.

328
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:41,320
However,

329
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,020
the same year he was nominated
as a vice presidential candidate.

330
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,020
His family's New York home
was targeted by an arsonist.

331
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
The family was safe,

332
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,480
but the far show that he
nor his African-american
Bretheran was still not safe

333
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,600
from violence even years
after the civil war and ended

334
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,870
Douglas spent the last two decades of
his life in Washington dc where he served

335
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,430
as a United States marshal.

336
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,080
We have an appointment
from President Hayes.

337
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,360
He and Anna lived in a
home called Cedar Hill.

338
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:15,891
And,

339
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:16,080
uh,

340
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,560
his first love and his inspiration for
his escape from slavery died in 18.

341
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,190
80 two.

342
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,950
Douglas remarried this time
to a much younger white women.

343
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,130
It's children were upset and
this was his new wife's family.

344
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,150
During the 18 eighties,

345
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,600
he continued traveling both
the country and the world,

346
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,830
giving speeches on a
number of political issues.

347
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,900
He also kept writing and issued a new
edition of his autobiography and 80 slash

348
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:36,540
81.

349
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,060
The life and times of Frederick
Douglass was his third book.

350
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,050
It also published my bondage
and my freedom in 1855.

351
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,210
The political appointments kept coming to.

352
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,290
He said often diplomatic positions as
recorder of deeds for DC into commission

353
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:49,450
now,

354
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,090
roughly welds Colombian exposition.

355
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,490
Douglas was speaking and crusading for
rice right until the end of his life in

356
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:56,241
1995,

357
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,820
he gave a speech at the national
convention of Women in DC.

358
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,770
He was incredibly well received,

359
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,380
but it was the last
speech he would ever give.

360
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,760
Shortly after the speech,

361
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,740
he had a heart attack and passed away.

362
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,360
He was 77 years old.

363
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,470
Thousands paid their respects to this
funeral in DC and Dr [inaudible] body was

364
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,520
then returned to Rochester,

365
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,300
New York,

366
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,950
where he was buried next to Anna Frederick
Douglass risked his life for freedom.

367
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,140
Not so many when he escaped from slavery,

368
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,620
but every time he put himself
out there as a public figure,

369
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,450
advocating for an end to slavery,

370
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
the right to vote and
civil rights for all.

371
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,770
We're going to leave you today with some
of his own powerful words where justice

372
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,460
is denied,

373
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,930
where poverty is enforced,

374
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,760
where ignorance prevails ends,

375
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,320
where any one class is made to feel that
society is an organized conspiracy to

376
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,270
oppress rob and degrade them.

377
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,510
Neither persons nor property will be safe.

378
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,330
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.
