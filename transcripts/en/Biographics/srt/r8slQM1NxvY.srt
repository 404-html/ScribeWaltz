00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,460
He is one of the most popular and
enduring icons over the American West,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,940
the gentleman bandit,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,850
charmed his way through life,

4
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:12,320
always keeping one step ahead of the
law with this fabled wild banshee,

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,120
terrorize the banks and the railway
companies during the closing decade of the

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,260
19th century.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,850
Then he headed south of the border
only to meet his match at the hands of

8
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,990
Bolivian treats.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,490
In this week's biographics graphics,

10
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:30,170
we delve into the life and
the death of butch cassidy.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,610
Leroy Parker was born in beaver
use R on April the third,

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,270
18,

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,080
66.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,770
It was named after his grandfather who
helps lead a group of Mormon handcart

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,780
refugees thousands of miles across the
country to the Utopia that was Utah.

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,120
Traveling along the Mormon trail.

17
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:03,350
They pulled all of their belongings in
handcarts with that faith and Brigham

18
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,370
young in the Lord.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,550
They headed into the snow drifts
of the continental divide.

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,950
Robert Parker senior was a strong man.

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,150
That's the harsh winter.

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,130
It was too much for him that he was found
dead one morning frozen in his blanket

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,770
policy forged on and often many trials.

24
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:20,300
They made it to Utah Pollock,

25
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:23,870
his widow in 12 year old son
Max settled at American fork,

26
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:27,080
some 30 miles south of
Salt Lake City in 18,

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,890
65.

28
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,080
They moved to beaver were Max married,

29
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:30,830
Don Campbell.

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,500
The couple would go on to
have 13 children together.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,030
Robert known as Bob.

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,320
He was the oldest.

33
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,340
Max polica became a successful
businessman when Bob was a young child.

34
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,910
His father purchased a ranch 12 miles
south of Circleville and to move the

35
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:45,060
family that they employed,

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,070
a number of cowboys including a petty
criminal by the name of Mike Cassidy

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,451
Cassidy.

38
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:54,410
He took a shine to young Bob who appeared
to idolize these swaggering outlaw.

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,930
He told the boy he has a shoot,

40
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:56,691
a gun ride,

41
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:57,231
a horse,

42
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,550
rope and brands,

43
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,960
and Russell Castle.

44
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,450
Bob was a good study and
by the time he was 16,

45
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,520
he had developed a reputation as a fine,

46
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,440
shortens a competent horseman.

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,390
He developed into a solid,

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,500
strapping teenager with a
pleasant and jovial personality.

49
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,860
There is not a lot known about
butches later teen years.

50
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,690
It appears that he took work as a
rancher in various locations until 1884.

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,960
At one point he gains work
as a butcher in rock springs,

52
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:24,620
Wyoming.

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,810
It was at this time that
he took the nickname.

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Butch cassidy was a amash do you?

55
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,830
His childhood hero,

56
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,420
Mike Cassidy Cassidy's first run in
with the law occurred around 1880.

57
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,700
He wanted to buy some
food and some clothes,

58
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,930
but found the shop to be closed on detail.

59
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,670
Z simply broke in and took a
pair of jeans as well as a pipe.

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,420
However,

61
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,680
he also left an Iou note indicating that
he would return to settle his account

62
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:49,514
later.

63
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,061
The shopkeeper,

64
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:53,210
though he was not impressed
and he had butcher arrested.

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,070
The case ended up before the courts were.

66
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,090
Jury acquitted him

67
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,213
in

68
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,490
1999.

69
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:04,600
A 23 year olds.

70
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,460
Butch cassidy turns up in telluride,

71
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,150
Colorado,

72
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,770
located in the San Juan Mountains.

73
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,160
Telluride was a wild
mining town full of gold.

74
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,370
Hungry prospect is the place
was filled with saloons,

75
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,990
gambling houses and brothels.

76
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,580
Sitting right smack in the middle of
town was the San Miguel Valley Bank.

77
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,260
Cassidy,

78
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,740
he teamed up with a fellow drift,

79
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,200
a by the name of Matt Warner,

80
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,960
and the two were joined investors
in a race horse named betty.

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,960
The money for that investment
came through cattle rustling.

82
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,030
They then decided to set their sights
a little higher determining to rob the

83
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,910
local bank.

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,330
It is believed that they robbed the
stage in Denver prior to the bank heist.

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,140
They then made a show of spending money
liberally around telluride in order to

86
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,750
show that they were not desperate
men on the morning of June,

87
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,440
the 24th,

88
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,710
18,

89
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,700
89 cassidy,

90
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,290
warner and two accomplices,

91
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,060
one who is believed to have been Harry
longer bob best known as the Sundance

92
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,580
kid,

93
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,230
hitch the horses outside of the livery
store in telluride and then headed for a

94
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:03,460
saloon not far from the San Miguel
Valley Bank just prior to noon.

95
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,410
They noticed one of the
tellers exit the bank,

96
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,420
leaving just one man on duty
to have the Alamo's cabs,

97
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,340
God outside,

98
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,810
while the other two went to the bank,

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,020
and amazingly none of the robbers bothered
to wear a mask or otherwise conceal

100
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:14,854
his identity.

101
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,190
History also does not reveal the
role that each individual plate.

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,130
We do know though that one of the men
who went into the bank approach the loan

103
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:26,170
tatler and told him that he wanted to
cash a check when the man began to inspect

104
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,310
the track has had,

105
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,010
was grabbed and shoved into
the desk at this point,

106
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:34,150
so the two outside came in and for began
ransacking the bank in such a money,

107
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,350
they go away with more than
$20,000 on the way out of town.

108
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,020
Cassidy and one over
recognize by two men still.

109
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:44,830
They managed to get away hiding out
in a remote area of southeastern Utah,

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,450
known as robber's roost.

111
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,820
This would become a
favorite place of escape.

112
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,350
The cassidy and his gang,

113
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,670
who builds cabins there and catch this
stone and cattle horses and weaponry in

114
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,300
this area.

115
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,430
Cassidy used some of the profits from
that bank job to buy a ranch near Dubois,

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,250
Wyoming.

117
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,180
In 1894,

118
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,390
he began a relationship with a teenage
girl by the name of Anne Bassett,

119
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,980
who was the daughter of a wealthy cattle
rancher for four years after the San

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,813
Miguel Valley bank robbery.

121
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,670
Butch managed to live the
life of a law abiding citizen.

122
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,210
However,

123
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,600
shortly after becoming involved with
and he was arrested for horse stealing,

124
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,520
his trial took place in Monza,

125
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,060
Wyoming.

126
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,680
Guns resulted in his conviction and
sentence to two years imprisonment at the

127
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:26,080
Wyoming state penitentiary and Laramie.

128
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,240
Cassidy proved to be a model prisoner.

129
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,000
He applied to the Wyoming
governor for a Audi release.

130
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,090
This was agreed on the condition that
he would stay out of trouble in the

131
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,780
future.

132
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,470
Butch,

133
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,131
he agreed,

134
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,310
but he had no intention of
following through on that promise.

135
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,160
Immediately upon his
release on January the 19th,

136
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,461
18,

137
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,210
96,

138
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,440
he rejoined his gang.

139
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,810
That's an area of their
robin's roost hideaway,

140
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,300
known as the hole in the wall.

141
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,120
It was following butches release from
Wyoming state penitentiary that he and his

142
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,700
wild bunch gang began their
crime spree and honest.

143
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,301
The gang was in,

144
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:06,500
launched more than 30 members with a core
of such notables as the Sun Dawns Kid,

145
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,191
kid curry,

146
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,520
and I was a lay on the
afternoon of August the 13th,

147
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,940
18,

148
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,511
96,

149
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,010
three men in Montpellier,

150
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,730
Idaho.

151
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,240
They dismounted in front of the bank and
then to have them pulled that bandannas

152
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,110
over their faces,

153
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,130
the bend quickly pulled out that
revolvers and the two wearing bandanas.

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,910
How did the men into the bank inside
were a number of customers and bank

155
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:26,744
employees.

156
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,980
Everyone except for one of the cashiers
was ordered to line up against the wall.

157
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,700
One of the rabbids who is believed to
have been cassidy kept his gun trained on

158
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,970
the terrifying customers while
another filter bags with cash,

159
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,570
gold and silver that before
leaving with that $7,000,

160
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:45,770
but cassidy or did the people to wait
for 10 minutes before raising the alarm.

161
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,670
The Robo who had remained downside bald
makes was the only one who did not cover

162
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,390
his face.

163
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,870
He was recognized by the town residents
and ended up being one of only three

164
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,141
people.

165
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,030
It was captured and
convicted of the crime.

166
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,770
Cassidy was well known in Utah,

167
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,730
runs as a result,

168
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,550
as a general rule of not
committing crimes in that state.

169
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,211
However,

170
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:03,080
in April of 18,

171
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,510
97 be made an exception to that rule.

172
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,010
His target was the payroll of the Pleasant
Valley Coal Company and cost gate.

173
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,950
This was the largest coal
mine in Carbon County,

174
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:13,700
Utah.

175
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,150
Furthermore,

176
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,780
it was ideally located between the gangs
favorite high downs of robbers roost

177
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,800
and Brown's hole.

178
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,340
The company knew that that payroll
was an enticing prize for bandits,

179
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,880
and so they tried to prevent heists
by keeping irregular paydays.

180
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,280
The payroll came in on a train
that was heavily guarded.

181
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,710
Butch decided there's going
off against the train,

182
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,461
was too risky,

183
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,330
and so he did tell him and take the
money directly from the payment stuff in

184
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,650
order to do so high for the gang,

185
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,590
would need to know when the
payroll was going to arrive.

186
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,120
On April the 17th cassidy road into the
town of castle gate and went to one of

187
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,990
the saloons were inquired if there
was any work going for a run hand.

188
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,890
He was told that the might be if he
was patient enough with his excuse for

189
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,690
hanging around now established.

190
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,490
He made his way to the train depot.

191
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,430
He watched the goings on
as the train came and wins,

192
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:00,680
and then returned to the
saloon for the next week.

193
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,880
He repeated this process,

194
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,860
observing every train that came into town
on April the 22nd cassidy's patients.

195
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,710
It was finally rewarded
a whistle from the mine,

196
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,030
announced that it was payday.

197
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,200
When the train arrived,

198
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,170
butch watched from a distance
is the paymaster fit.

199
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,671
Coffins.

200
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:16,040
Aaron's,

201
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,060
a couple of aides,

202
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,030
carried money bags from
the train to his office.

203
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,961
The bags were heavy.

204
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:24,920
You containing more than $7,000 in
gold and I have a $100 in Silva,

205
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,260
so the men were going slowly
then just as a ready decline.

206
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,900
The stands for the paymasters office.

207
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,670
Calvin's a was approached from behind
and a revolver was poked into its rips.

208
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,420
Butch informs him that he was about to
relieve him and his pals of their load.

209
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,760
Adding the did hate to
have to shoot any of them.

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,500
Competency was stunned that such a
brazen attack would be attempted in broad

211
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,334
daylight.

212
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,180
There were plenty of miners arounds,

213
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,800
but very few of them spoke English or
would have been aware of what was going

214
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:52,220
on.

215
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,190
Gang member Elza lay and the from the
shadows and helps butch take possession of

216
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,590
the moneybags coffins
that and his helpers,

217
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,350
left them to it,

218
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,380
seeking protection in
the nearby Howard West.

219
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:04,740
All the paymaster then began
yelling out that had been robbed.

220
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,310
Cassidy and lay attempted to mount their
horses well stealing the money and that

221
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,540
saddlebags if a butcher,

222
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,370
his horse got spooked and took off,

223
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,460
leaving him standing in the middle of the
street with a bag of gold in his hand,

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,400
lay managed to track the horse
down and bring it back to the two,

225
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:20,610
and they made away with
over $7,000 in gold.

226
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,790
They left the bag of silver
just lying in the street.

227
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,580
Payments to compensate and
out sprang into action.

228
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:27,990
He ran for the Telegraph office,

229
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,040
instructed the to send an urgent
message to the authorities in price,

230
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,510
which was some 10 miles away.

231
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,111
However,

232
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:37,170
the clerk told him the lines
had been cut thinking fast.

233
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:40,830
He made for the train and told the
driver to hightail it to price.

234
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,150
As the train chugged along,

235
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,280
it went right past the fleeing Roberts.

236
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,050
It took several hours before the sheriff.

237
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,150
It price could get a posse organized.

238
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
In addition to having this headstart,

239
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,000
butch was also very familiar with the
countryside and was easily able to evade

240
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,530
as as local ranches.

241
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:58,380
We're also happy to provide
his gang with fresh horses,

242
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:02,730
having no loyalty to the big
mining companies or indeed
the banks constantly in

243
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:03,031
Lei.

244
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:07,080
They made it a bag so that base had
robber's roost where they lay low with the

245
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,010
other gang members.

246
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,020
The officials in Utah were well
aware of where the robbers were,

247
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:13,740
but showed no enthusiasm
for going after them.

248
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,970
As a result of the local papers began
to accuse the lawman of cowardice for

249
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:18,660
three months,

250
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,730
butch and his men spend
their time drinking,

251
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,200
gambling and horse riding.

252
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,120
Then when the boredom was too much,

253
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:27,330
they decided to go out and
start spending that takings.

254
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,610
They ranged around buying fine clothes,

255
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,480
getting hack accounts,

256
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:33,630
and spending up launch in
the saloons and the brothels.

257
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,170
By the end of June 19,

258
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:41,711
97,

259
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:44,830
it was time to get back to
the business of robbery.

260
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,470
The Guy who said that science
on the town of Belle fourche,

261
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,670
north of black hills.

262
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,810
On June the 28th,

263
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,080
Butch send gang member Tahmo
day to scout out the town.

264
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,810
The plan was to rob the bank
once a day had gotten back,

265
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,590
however the day managed to get himself
drunk and didn't return to camp until it

266
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,121
was 40.

267
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:03,880
Relate an angry butch had to
delay the heist for 24 hours.

268
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,601
The next day,

269
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:07,480
Butch selected the Sun Don
skid along with George Curry.

270
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,180
Walter put me and Tomo Day to do the job.

271
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:11,710
That's the Butte county bank.

272
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,290
The three men followed
the usual procedure.

273
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,620
Drawing their revolvers is enforcing the
customers to stand along the wall with

274
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:18,610
their hands in the APP.

275
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,820
However possible.

276
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,450
I saw this through the window
and they raised the alarm.

277
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,010
Chaos erupts it on the streets.

278
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:26,770
There's people rush to get off the
street while others went for that.

279
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:27,580
Guns,

280
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,570
the bandits inside,

281
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,120
they quickly realized that
they had been found out.

282
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,960
They rushed out,

283
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,710
firing their guns in the air and
attempting to get away a couple of towns.

284
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:37,450
People returned fire from behind.

285
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,231
Cover good.

286
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,650
Carrie was unable to get to his horse,

287
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:42,640
so trying to mountain mule only
to discover that it wouldn't move.

288
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,300
As the other two rode out of town,

289
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,200
Tom O'day attempted to steal
away into a side street,

290
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:50,620
but it was caught and held overnight
and the local bank vaults before being

291
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:55,150
transported to the jail and deadwood
the very day the robbery had been an

292
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,650
unmitigated disaster.

293
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,770
It had cost the gang a valued member
and earns them just $97 leaving behind

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,030
$3,000

295
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,750
and the early morning hours of June,

296
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:13,010
the second 80 slash 99,

297
00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:17,240
the wild bunch pulled off one of the
most celebrated crimes to two members of

298
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:21,260
the gang with redlands and flags down
the Union Pacific overlands flyer train

299
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:24,140
just outside of the
Willcox station and Wilcox,

300
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:24,860
Wyoming.

301
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,850
The driver thought the two
men were warning him that
the driving rain has washed

302
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,110
out and approaching bridge.

303
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,110
He threw on the brakes and bring
the train to a screeching halt,

304
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,150
but what is all of the men had guns drawn.

305
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:38,750
He realized the truth and began running
down the track to want to come and

306
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,800
drains to back off the bandaid can go
and jumps onto the train where they

307
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:46,760
ordered the engineer to pull the train
into a nearby trestle on the far side of

308
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,510
the bridge.

309
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,860
Once the train had crossed over,

310
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,710
one of the bandits lit the
fuse to stash of dynamite,

311
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:53,150
which had been placed on the bridge.

312
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,020
The bridge was damaged enough that the
second drain would be unable to follow

313
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,160
the train engineer then,

314
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,700
or did the train forward another two
miles where the rest of the gang we're

315
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:02,330
waiting.

316
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,200
The robbers then made their
way to the express call.

317
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,010
I need to find out that the god see
he wasn't going to open the door,

318
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,480
so they decided to let me say,

319
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,490
but with dynamize,

320
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,290
this Russell,

321
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,671
the god,

322
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:15,550
to the extent that he couldn't remember
the combination to the safe so well,

323
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,940
the robbers blue,

324
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,960
that open as well.

325
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,200
The result was that all the
cash went flying everywhere,

326
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,460
still the gang managed to get away
with more than $50,000 worth of cash,

327
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,960
gold and jewelry.

328
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,070
The robbery made national headlines and
brought the wild bunch to the attention

329
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,990
of the nation's premier crime fighters,

330
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,620
the Pinkerton Detective
Agency for the next two years,

331
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:38,870
the pinkertons doggedly
tracked down the gang.

332
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,591
Meanwhile,

333
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:42,440
the policy was formed to
chase down the train robbers.

334
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,880
They caught up with a three bandits.

335
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,780
On June the sixth,

336
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:48,830
that Castle creek a gun battle ensued
in which kid car he shot and killed the

337
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:50,060
sheriff leading the posse.

338
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,450
The posse members then with
drew is the outlaws escaped.

339
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,160
Butch Cassidy was north of
the rough and tumble molds,

340
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,690
most of his contemporary outlaws where
he was an extremely sociable man who was

341
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,260
a great conversationalist.

342
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,140
We're not engaged in criminal activity.

343
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,660
Hey impressed others with
his strong work ethic.

344
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,171
By 18,

345
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:14,681
99,

346
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,360
he had a thriving ranch in Dubois,

347
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:16,841
Wyoming,

348
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:19,120
and it was growing tired
of the outlaw life.

349
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,170
In the summer of that year,

350
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:23,740
he visited the office of
Attorney Orlando Powers in Ogden,

351
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:24,310
Utah.

352
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,730
He explained to the attorney that he
had been portrayed as a vicious criminal

353
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:30,790
when in fact he has never hurt
anybody and it only have a role,

354
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,410
but for large corporations,

355
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,831
Bush.

356
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,970
Then jd powers do approach the governor
on his behalf seeking an amnesty deal.

357
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,720
The lawyer responded that a deal was
extremely unlikely and the best thing that

358
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,090
butch could do was to go back into hiding.

359
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,010
Undeterred.

360
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,740
Butch sought out another attorney.

361
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,010
This time the meeting
was arranged with Utah.

362
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,330
Governor Abbott Wells.

363
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,330
Wells was impressed by
cassidy and told him this.

364
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,280
As long as there were no
outstanding murder warrants for him,

365
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,370
he was sure that amnesty
could be arranged.

366
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,180
The second meeting was arranged which
butcher attended in full confidence.

367
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,870
He was surprised to learn however that
the governor's office had uncovered and

368
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,700
outstanding murder warrants in his name.

369
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,790
Butch protest is that it never
killed a man in his life.

370
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,870
He didn't have to.

371
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,250
Though the governor responded,

372
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,110
the charge was enough.

373
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,373
Immense.

374
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,560
Amnesty was simply out of the question

375
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,170
with the failure of his
attempt to go straight.

376
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:31,160
It seems that butch carried out a string
of further robberies around the turn of

377
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:31,994
the century.

378
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,670
Don't have been linked to
a train robbery in Tipton,

379
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:39,350
Wyoming in August of 1900 and the
winner mark in Nevada bank heist a month

380
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,351
later,

381
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:43,430
though there is no concrete evidence
that they took part with no prospects to

382
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,080
end is fugitive life in the west,

383
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,740
which began making plans to head south
of the border when he proposed the idea

384
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,600
to his gang members.

385
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:53,720
Seventy two were interested the sundance
kid and could carry before the gang

386
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,531
split up for good.

387
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,920
It's five core members out
of final rendezvous in Texas.

388
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,350
Also having their fill of liquor,

389
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,470
fine dining and women.

390
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:03,230
They sat for a group
photograph in new suits.

391
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,130
The photo that was taken on that day
made its way to the Pinkerton detective

392
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,950
agency and it was used on wanted posters.

393
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,970
Butch and Sundance then split up promising
to meet up again in New York City.

394
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,260
This they did with Sundance
being accompanied by his
longtime girlfriend at a

395
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:18,950
place.

396
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,660
The trio boarded the ship bound for
when our series on February the 20th,

397
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,800
1,901

398
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,500
immediately upon arrival books using
the assumed name of Jim Rohn deposit of

399
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,930
$12,000 in a local bank is the first
step and putting up a land claim.

400
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,580
They ended up purchasing 17,000 acres
of lands and shall Lilo to their

401
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:45,001
neighbors.

402
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,440
There appeared to be hardworking,

403
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:49,290
gringos z except for one disturbing facts.

404
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,370
Wherever they went,

405
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,230
they wore that guns.

406
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,360
Butch and Sundance said,

407
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,090
presumed that a move out of the country
would bring it in to that pursuit by the

408
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,953
pinkertons,

409
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,400
but they were mistaken.

410
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,360
Robert Pinkerton,

411
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,840
the head of the agency sends a letter
to the [inaudible] police chief with

412
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,030
descriptions and photos of the dealer.

413
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,130
The local police identified them as the
two ranches who always wore guns around

414
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,740
cello.

415
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,230
They attempted to keep it
close surveillance on the man,

416
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,330
so all the pinkertons
arrived and apprehended them.

417
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,530
The two animals would spend seven years
in Argentina before the law finally

418
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,270
caught up with them for
the first five years.

419
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,800
They kept that noses clean.

420
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,170
Blending in with the locals
and becoming popular members.

421
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:25,551
Of the trinity,

422
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,400
low community.

423
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,540
Then for some reason they returned to
a life of crime in the spring of 19.

424
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:30,631
Oh,

425
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,140
six.

426
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,250
They teamed up with another
American fugitive and Robin
to the bank and Mercedes

427
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:37,200
getting away with $20,000.

428
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,860
However,

429
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,770
one of the three robbers shot
and killed a bank teller.

430
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,753
Once again,

431
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,100
butch and sundance were on the run

432
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,053
on November the sixth.

433
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,830
It was made their way
to send the incentive.

434
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:53,400
Bolivia,

435
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,100
they were put up in the spare
room of a local villager.

436
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,730
However,

437
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,300
a local official identified them and
notified members of the Bolivian cavalry.

438
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,510
The room were butch and sundance
were holed up with surrounded.

439
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,530
There are a number of versions as
to how the last moments played out.

440
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,160
The most accepted version is that sun
don't sprint it out onto the patio in a

441
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,110
desperate attempt to get some rifles.

442
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,090
These were located by an outside wall.

443
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,600
Lindsay was firing his revolvers into
the errors of distraction as he ran.

444
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,260
However,

445
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,910
he was cut down before he made it off.

446
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,720
The patio.

447
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,540
Butch ran out after him and
dragged is mortally wounded.

448
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,590
Friends back inside,

449
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,080
sustaining at least one
wound in the process.

450
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,680
After pouring masses of lead into the
building and hearing one silence from

451
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:34,680
within the Bolivian troops
finally made their way inside.

452
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,620
They found the bodies of the
two outlaws lying on the floor.

453
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,370
Sundance had been shot several times
in the arms and once in the forehead,

454
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,740
while butch had a bullet
hole in the temple,

455
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,640
the soldiers is in fudge that books should
put his best friend out of his misery

456
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,410
before turning the gun on himself.

457
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,011
However,

458
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:53,280
there was never an inquest and the two
men were never formally identified.

459
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,840
The most wanted men in America was
simply buried in unmarked graves.

460
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,520
So already have you found this video.

461
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,031
