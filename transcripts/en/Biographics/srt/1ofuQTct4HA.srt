1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,890
It was the height of the depression and
America was in desperate need of a hero.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,000
They found it in the most
unlikely of places. Butler,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,610
who looked about as beat up as the
nation itself for a race horse,

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,980
he didn't have much going for him.
His legs were too short.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,750
Is An Equis too thick and you had a swing
for lag that jutted out wildly? Well,

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,410
first of all,

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,040
we had a mind of his own when he felt
like running ad run and when he did,

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,630
and he simply wouldn't,

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,830
it's hard to believe that this was say
horse that lost his first 17 starts.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,030
We'd become a legends.

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,350
The greatest resource in history and this
episode of biographics not looking at

12
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:33,741
a person,

13
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,190
but indeed we're looking at the amazing
story of Seabiscuit the horse that

14
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,450
brought the nation together.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,540
Seabiscuit was born home or accurately
falls on May the 23rd 1933 in Lexington,

16
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,260
Kentucky.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,970
He was the son of a nasty tempered rogue
and namd hardtack and Denzel man named

18
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:09,020
swing on seabiscuits. Father had greet
speed, no doubt owing to his pedigree.

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,870
His father,

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,180
man of war was considered by most experts
at the time to be the greatest race

21
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:15,860
horse who ever was produced.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,430
Although his grandson would certainly
go on to challenge that claim.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,250
The problem with hardtack was
that he was uncontrollable.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,910
Even Hall of fame trainer, Sunny Jim
Fitz Simmons couldn't tame him. See,

25
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,180
this gets mother. It was the complete
opposite of heart attack. She was a calm,

26
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:32,240
gentle horse with thick knees
and short legs swinging on.

27
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:35,850
It wasn't very fast though, so she
never raced the cold that she signed.

28
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:39,230
It didn't look very promising. His
legs were study. His knees were thick.

29
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,550
Antinori sort of funny. When he ran,
even seabiscuits color was against him.

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,400
He was a solid,

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,230
muddy bay with new distinguishing
white stripe or star on his face.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,230
So these sources,
they were all loans by Ogden Mills,

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,490
secretary of the US Treasury, as
well as his sister, Mrs Hc fibs.

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,860
They're racing staple was one of the
finest in America with no expense being

35
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,480
spared in the care and training
of the horses. However,

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,100
Mrs fibs insisted that only horses that
would bring honor to the stable would be

37
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:07,730
caps.

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,350
The reason that hardtack and swing on
still around was that they both had very

39
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:13,490
strong pedigrees.

40
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,840
I always hoped that that offspring would
have amazing speed during his first

41
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:18,160
year.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,250
You best get along with his mother was
put into a 50 acre pasture with Nadine,

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,370
other thoroughbred mares
and then newborn false.

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,600
So in every group of cults
that are usually two that
stand out, one is the hero,

45
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:30,560
the better looking,

46
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:35,210
more graceful and foster one and the
other is the outcast and awkward warranty

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,810
looking little fellow who looked as if
he slipped in when no one was watching.

48
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,460
In this group, the hero is Granville
Mans the outcast. Well that,

49
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:46,640
we'll see this get, but something in
cvs gets to downsize to keen observers.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,360
Several times a day the cults would race
up and down the paddock with Seabiscuit

51
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,290
always at the rear. Yeah. The
gangly colts was never discouraged.

52
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,820
The father and he was left behind.

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,580
The harder he drove himself
and the longer the race,

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
the narrow he came to catching up with
his big heads and short spindly legs.

55
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,250
Seabiscuit spends more energy than other
cults running. As a result of this.

56
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,740
He had a launch wrap or something from
the other cults and even developed a

57
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:13,630
stronger and tougher leg muscles and by
late that fall he was no longer running

58
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,740
at the back of the pack.

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,450
Emerging as a yearling on January the
first 1934 see this gets looked more like

60
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,940
a ragged range pony than a thoroughbred.

61
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,450
He fell to shout his winter coat and
his legs and back where a few inches

62
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,360
shorter than average. In fact, he
was such an ugly duckling. The wind,

63
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,090
Mrs Fibs came in April to
inspect their horses. See,

64
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,510
this guy was as in a way
and an outlying bomb by now.

65
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,820
They see this kid had
found his running legs.

66
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,890
He was challenging
Grandville for the lead.

67
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,920
It may not have had to have the
physical attributes of the other horses,

68
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,570
but it was full of stamina
and determination. So by
mid summer, these rivals,

69
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,730
they were absolutely racing neck and
neck and it was then that Seabiscuit

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,320
develops or habits that would be the
trademark that he'd carry for the rest of

71
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:56,890
his life. Whenever they were vying for
the lead, he would snort at Grandville.

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,510
There's an attempt to do bully
him and throw him on pace.

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,583
Okay.

74
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,900
In June of 1934 Grandville and cbus gifts
that they were ships to Sunny Jim Fitz

75
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,020
Simmons recognized as perhaps the
finest strainer in the country,

76
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,370
but Simmons had developed a hatred for
seabiscuits father hardtack after years

77
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,770
of being unable to break him,
and there's a vicious habits.

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,430
It also given up on the swing
on finding her to slow and lazy.

79
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,890
This it did not bode well for Seabiscuit.

80
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,980
If at Simmons looked upon as a
curse from the very beginning,

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,700
he put the majority of his energy
into training Granville while forcing

82
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:41,930
Seabiscuit to conform. See
this get. Meanwhile, it was
determines not to comply.

83
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,690
He simply refused to go fast.
Finally,

84
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:48,920
an exasperated Fitzsimmons gave his
jockey a wooden stake and told him,

85
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,130
hits the biscuit just as many
times as you can in a quarter mile.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,330
They run them against Faust,

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
the fastest sprinter among the group and
trying to escape these severe beating

88
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,000
Seabiscuit exploded around the track
leaving Faust foreign his wake.

89
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,860
He ran the quarter mile in 22 seconds
and two fifths and if you don't know,

90
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:09,920
this is an incredibly good
time and amaze to Fitzsimmons,

91
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:13,610
but it also confirmed in his mind that
seabiscuits would only show his potential

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,260
under severe punishments.

93
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,650
When on January the 31st 1935 the horses
under Fitzsimmons became two year olds

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Seabiscuit. It was tossed aside. It
was put to work. I say Hack Raisa.

95
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,240
On January the 19th he was
entered into a shorter race,

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,220
losing by four and a half lengths.
During 1935 he ran a total of 35 races,

97
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,720
losing the first 17 which was
not exactly a brilliant start.

98
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,890
It was only when his jockey stopped
beating him and let him run his own race

99
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,540
that he showed real promise.

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,020
He wound up five races setting
three track records in the process.

101
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,780
Still that Simmons,
he was desperate to get rid of him.

102
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,480
Convinced to that Seabiscuit
was an inconsistent,

103
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,860
no hope that on August the third 1936 the
Fitzsimmons entered seabiscuits in the

104
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:59,000
$6,000 claiming stakes at.
Fortunately for him,

105
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,500
this just happens to be one of those
days when see this get decided to turn it

106
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,040
on.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,040
He won by six full lengths up in the
stands and all the time veteran cowboy and

108
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,040
veteran trainer named Tom Smith,
so heart and courage in seabiscuits.

109
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,660
He decided that he had to have
him a week later to see this gets,

110
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:21,720
he was purchased by Charles Howard for
$8,000 and hand it over to Tom Smith the

111
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,400
training.

112
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,750
The horse finally had a trainer who
both respected him and saw his limitless

113
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,710
potential. Seabiscuit was subjected
to an intense conditioning campaign.

114
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,910
There was that no one wants.

115
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,450
It suddenly was pampered and
grooms with a focus on foot care.

116
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,030
In order to recover from
the grueling schedule,

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,080
you had been forced to India or under
Fitz Simmons as a result of the care and

118
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,760
attention that was lavished upon him.
See,

119
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,120
this gets began performing more
consistently on the practice track.

120
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,350
Either became gentler and seem
to develop a competitive spirit.

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,860
He also developed a huge appetite eating
anything that was put before him to

122
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,671
keep his weight down.

123
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:59,510
Grooms are instructed to muzzle him at
night in order to prevent him from eating

124
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,090
his straw bedding.
A combination of patients,

125
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,960
kindness and skillful training of Tom
Smith initially to transform seabiscuits

126
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:10,040
courage and intelligence into raw,
unbridled speed,

127
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,550
although is needed now is to match
Seabiscuit with the right jockey.

128
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,750
Smith found him in the form of Jack
Red Polardy Feisty, 27 year olds,

129
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:21,770
Canadian who'd been roaming around the
West riding and boxing for over a decade

130
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,010
is other thoroughbreds was
as deep as Tom Smith. Yes.

131
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,310
Although the was one of the better drug
is on the Bush circuit had only won

132
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:32,750
three state races in his life. When
red first entered, cbus get stalled.

133
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,840
The horse was busy munching on Straw.
See this get looked up,

134
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,750
gave us snort and then ambled over to
Paula and rubbed his muzzle against red

135
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,840
shoulder as well.
With that,

136
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,770
one of history's greatest
partnerships was born satisfied.

137
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:50,330
He was ready how it ended Seabiscuit
into a series of races in Detroit into

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,630
races, the Detroit governors
handicap and the Scarsdale handicap.

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,720
He came at home first and I think $12,900
in prize money for his owner over the

140
00:07:58,851 --> 00:07:59,571
next two months.

141
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:04,571
Their winnings accrued to a remarkable
$40,000 a delighted Howard gave him a two

142
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,420
month vacation and then
the 1936 see this get to,

143
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,450
he was sent by rail to California to
compete in his last two races are three

144
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,610
roles. The first it was the bay bridge
handicap despite starting badly red and

145
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,930
Seabiscuit soon found their stride and
they won by five lengths in their last

146
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,880
race of the year for Wells Fargo Handicap.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,700
They led from the start
cruising to an easy victory,

148
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,230
but at the beginning of 1937 as kids was
beginning to develop a reputation as an

149
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,460
pumpin coming champion.

150
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,720
The focus in the early part of the
year was marches Santa Anita Cup,

151
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,790
the biggest race on the west coast.

152
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,640
Seabiscuit started the
year well winning a warmup,

153
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:44,190
raisins answer Niesr in January.
Then in the San Antonio Handicap,

154
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,850
he was bumped at the start and to pushed
wide finishing a disappointing Beth and

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,450
now, well, it was time for the big one,

156
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,010
the $125,000 center and Nita Cup coming.

157
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,620
The home straight Seabiscuit was half
a length ahead of Rosemont the horse,

158
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,810
which had one the week before it.
San Antonio,

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,150
but it's Red Polos who
was blinded is right.

160
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:07,980
I didn't know that Roselands was closing
in and failed to Seabiscuit into the

161
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,400
next year. Rosemont's won by a
nose. This disappointment though,

162
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,440
it was followed by three easy wins.

163
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,160
Establishing seabiscuits gets reputation
on the west coast as the breakout

164
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,890
thoroughbred of the year. By
this time, Charles Howard,

165
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:24,330
he was making some pretty great money
off this investments, but he wanted more.

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,950
He was determined that cbus get to be
recognized as the greatest resource in the

167
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,810
entire United States.

168
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,580
That means breaking in to the far
more prestigious east coast circuit.

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,380
So between June the 26th and August the
seventh he entered Seabiscuit into five

170
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,620
east coast races.
He won every single one of them.

171
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,830
He finished 1937 with a record,

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,580
11 wins out of 15 races and was the
biggest money on it in the country.

173
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,960
It was also now the most famous horse
in America with the press having a field

174
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,530
day with his underdog story, the nation's
most prestigious and quite an award.

175
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,990
However,
it did not go to Seabiscuit that year.

176
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,430
The winner of the American horse of the
year award was the darling of the East

177
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,120
Coast Psat or admiral who had
just won the coveted triple crown.

178
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,860
Interestingly, war admiral
and see biscuits, they're
actually blood relatives.

179
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:26,370
See where the son and grandson of one of
the greatest thoroughbreds in history,

180
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:30,180
man of war, CPS gets farther. Heart
attack was war admirals brother.

181
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,130
In 1937 war admiral won every race he
started including the triple crown.

182
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,210
This prestigious honor is bestowed upon
thoroughbreds that win three major races

183
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:43,320
in succession. The Kentucky Derby
Preakness stakes and Belmont stakes,

184
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,221
but we're admirals.

185
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,790
Victory of bell mums when it was bitter
sweet and injury prevented him from

186
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,480
racing again for several months or
admiral was a natural competitor.

187
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,110
The life of the activity of race day
seem to fill him with nervous excitement.

188
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,160
He was so competitive.

189
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,370
It was difficult for handlers to hold
him back when the saddling bell rang.

190
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,000
His temperaments was fiery and
skittish just like his brother Han Tak,

191
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,850
but this personality that
usually worked to his advantage,

192
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,330
he never willingly walked into the
gate and once the starters got him in,

193
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,670
he would act up causing
delays and full stops.

194
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,860
At the beginning of the 1938 war admirals,

195
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,300
the best horse in the east and Seabiscuit
was the best horse in the west race.

196
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:21,180
Fans were anxious for the city of
champions to meet. That's Charles.

197
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,180
Howard knew that despite the public's
fascination with is unlikely star if see

198
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:28,290
this gives were to be taken seriously
as a challenge to war admiral.

199
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,350
We'd have to establish his
own reputation in the east.

200
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,070
Howard was a must promote them and
it's capitalized on establishing racing

201
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:37,470
rivalry between the east
coast and the west coast.

202
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,380
He was determined to prove that
a horse coming out of California,

203
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,500
it could be the equal of anything that
ran into the east and it was at this

204
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:47,110
point that be began issuing public
challenges to Sam Riddle. The own revoir.

205
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:50,850
Admiral riddle ignored him considering
it demeaning for his champion

206
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,190
thoroughbreds to meet a Western horse,

207
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,930
but after months of incessant media
chiding well, he finally agreed.

208
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,010
The question of it was the fastest horse
in the United States would be decided

209
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:16,350
by weight of a race to be held at the
PIMLICO racetrack in Baltimore, Maryland.

210
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,160
This would take place on November the
first 1938 the distance was to be one and

211
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,650
16 miles result insisted,
however,

212
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:27,940
that the race begin with no gate or
a walkup start in order to avoid war

213
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,980
admirals,
temperamental behavior in the gate.

214
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,410
How it agreed to start the
race where the starting bell,

215
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,250
but he also had a condition.
The track had to be fast or dry.

216
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Seabiscuits he did not run well in mud.
If the track was to west because of rain,

217
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,980
the race,
it would be called off.

218
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,830
Then things while they started to
go wrong in the Seabiscuit camp,

219
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,030
red polo fractured his leg while working
with another horse and he wasn't able

220
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:51,850
to race Paula as good friends
and fellow top jockey.

221
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,320
George to the iceman wolf would ride
Seabiscuit and stat. Up until that time,

222
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,340
every match recent history had been won
by the horse that was in the lead from

223
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:03,840
the start throughout all of his
races in 1937 a war admiral,

224
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:07,570
a peasant never let another horse
in front of him. Yeah. Seabiscuits.

225
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,690
He was a come from behind winner or
admirals trainer George Conway and Druggie

226
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,560
Charlie, Kurt Singer, work confidence that
that horse was faster than Seabiscuit.

227
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,210
This men's,

228
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,400
they concentrated on building war
admiral stamina to endure the mile long

229
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,000
distance. Meanwhile, Tom Smith was
concentrating on the start of the race.

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,510
He put together a starting bell that
sounded like the starting Bella Pimlico

231
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,080
when he rang the bell. Wolf cracks
the whip on seabiscuits backside.

232
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,830
This condition, cvs gets to run
the ads top speed immediately.

233
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,530
The rest of the century.
It was a worldwide sensation.

234
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,910
The racetrack was so crowded that
10,000 people crowded outside the gates

235
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,440
sitting in trees and standing on car moves
to try and to see the race across the

236
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:50,590
United States. 40 million
people tuned to their radios in.

237
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,770
Many of them didn't care about horse
racing previously, but now they were.

238
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:57,820
Kings at here is three being made most
of them while they were rooting for

239
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,130
[inaudible],
Johnny curtsying over on war,

240
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,940
Admiral wore black and yellow silks and
road the rail while George Wolfe with

241
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:08,080
red and white silks sitting astride see
this Skitch took the outside or admiral

242
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,170
prepared for the race the way he
always did raring up and tormenting his

243
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:14,290
handlers. Meanwhile, Seabiscuit
commonly headed for the post.

244
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,750
The flag was raised in
the horses lined up,

245
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,410
but just as the start who was about to
ring the bell will pulled Seabiscuit back.

246
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,400
It was a tactic to make war
admiral nervous when they're
lined up a second time

247
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:26,830
cards. Singapore, this
horseback on the third try.

248
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,620
Both horses lined up at
exactly the same moment.

249
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,400
The starter bell rang and they were off
the two thoroughbreds pounded down the

250
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,450
track,
neck and neck.

251
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,600
It was commonly believed that war
admiral would take the early lead so the

252
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:41,890
crowds were astonished when Wolf cracks
the whip and see this get edged in front

253
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,760
around the first turn and see this get
was still in the lead or veered left and

254
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,990
took the rail from cad singer.

255
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,950
Then he slowed cvs get right down in
front of war admiral in order to conserve

256
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,041
cuts,
singer,

257
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:56,530
now we they have to slow down himself or
possible war admiral drew closer to see

258
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:57,321
biscuits,
but it was still,

259
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,700
I had to buy a length and a
half going into the backstretch.

260
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,000
The distance widens by two lengths.

261
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,030
Then Kurt Singer cracks the
whip and in just a few strides,

262
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:08,270
Warren admiral was even with
Seabiscuit the crowd by this point,

263
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,680
there were going absolutely wild horses
challenge down the straight and neck and

264
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:13,010
neck.

265
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,670
Then we're having real took the lead but
only for a moment to see biscuits sped

266
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,790
up. He was once again in front
turning into the stretch.

267
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,060
It was anybody's race rounds rounded
the far town and we're headed for home.

268
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,770
They were a couple of
shoulder to shoulder,

269
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,160
had to had ITI around the
town as they headed for home.

270
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,460
Wolf cracks the whip asking
Seabiscuit for everything he has.

271
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,500
He loosened the reigns
and the horse answered,

272
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,120
dropping his Jen is his pins back and to
race towards the finish line. The crowd,

273
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,960
they were astounded to see Seabiscuit
breakaway by one, then two,

274
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,560
then three lengths in the
end, what it was, no contest.

275
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,790
Seabiscuits was the winner by four
lengths leaving war admiral in his dust.

276
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,500
A Seabiscuit slowed to a gallop.

277
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,700
Thousands of fans burst through the
infield chasing their underdog hero in the

278
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,330
winner's circle.

279
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,780
Seabiscuit was donged with a blanket
of yellow flowers or admirals bond.

280
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,330
That's they're defeated champion
and stepped away almost unnoticed.

281
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,290
Seabiscuit was now not only
the national racing champion,

282
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,110
but the fastest and most
famous horse in the wells.

283
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,680
He easily won horse of
the year in 1938 however,

284
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,530
the joy for cbus get it was
short lived in the next race.

285
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,090
He ruptured ligament in his leg.

286
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,900
He spent most of 1939 healing
and Howard ranch in California.

287
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,410
They come back for both Seabiscuit and
