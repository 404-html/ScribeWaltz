1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,110
He is the worldwide symbol of
rebellion and revolutionary struggle.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,140
His silhouette is familiar to billions
representing the epitome of cool

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,860
antiestablishment ism.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,920
Yet few people know the real story behind
the legends of Che Guevara and in this

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:21,090
week's biographics we discover the man
behind the myth to reveal an individual

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,540
whose passion for social
justice so are no bounds

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,351
and let's do it.

8
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:42,351
Guevara Della Center was born on June
the 14th 1928 and the town of Rosario

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,170
Ivan,
Tina.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,580
It's family was aristocratic with his
father when Nestor Guevara Lynch operating

11
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:52,080
construction and ship building businesses
born premature Levy Infants Guevara

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,610
who sued, acquired the
nickname che struggled with
asthma as well as pneumonia.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,280
His mother was the dominant
figure in his life,

14
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:04,281
teaching him to read and
write and impressing her
belief in social justice upon

15
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,260
him.
Jay was the oldest of five children.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,090
The family were exposed to a wide range
of political and philosophical thoughts

17
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,350
with his father being friendly with
many veterans of the Spanish civil war.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,910
The boy develops a strong interest in
sport at selling as athletics, swimming,

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,900
and rugby.

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,460
He was known for his aggressive style
of play and the mental drive to push his

21
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:31,380
body to the limit. Jay also develops
a passion for intellectual pursuits.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,550
By the age of 10 he had become a very
good chess player in the veracious reader.

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,210
I think Avara home was overflowing with
books on a wide range of subject six

24
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:44,490
supposing him to the ideas of men
like Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud,

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,500
and Friedrich Engels k also showed a
great love for poetry and his early teens.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,730
Che's interest in the philosophies of
great thinkers of the past that didn't to

27
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:57,900
keep a personal journal in which he
would summarize their main ideas as he

28
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,530
formulated his own outlook
on life at school chain.

29
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,420
He was confident and determined a school
nature men button as incredibly sure of

30
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:11,130
himself and totally independent in
his opinions, very dynamic, restless,

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,660
and unconventional. He acted more maturely
than many of his peers and associates.

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,190
While I'm still in high school.

33
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,360
He surrounded himself with university
students proving to be the intellectual

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,310
equal and showing a political insight
that often even surpass bears.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,750
On one occasion, his university pals
edge DMZ join them in a political rally.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,310
He replies, go out in the streets so
the police can hit us with their clubs,

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,660
nothing doing.

38
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,460
I'll go and demonstrate only if
you give me a gun. In later life.

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,990
Guevara made their comments.

40
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,000
That was certainly the case for himself
and then of 15 already knows what he

41
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,810
wants to die for and he is not afraid
of giving his life if he has found an

42
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,600
ideal which makes the sacrifice easy.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,230
At Age 15 Guevara ideal was still
in a raw state consisting us.

44
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:04,231
We're more of a passion for equality
for all and a rejection of materialism.

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,260
Still at this age, he was more
interested in sports and politics.

46
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,870
You impressed everyone with
this fierce self-discipline.

47
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,290
His ass man made it a challenge for
him to stay on the rugby fields,

48
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:19,291
but he saw his condition as a barrier
of it could be overcome with sheer force

49
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:24,340
of will chase self-discipline
translated to his academic life as well.

50
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,320
After graduating from high school,

51
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:31,150
he completed a six year university
medical degree in just three years.

52
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,780
His aunt later recalled.
We would listen to him gasping,

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,870
studying as he lay on the
floor to ease his breathing,

54
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,070
but he never complains for him.
There was a challenge,

55
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,891
jade,
again,

56
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:53,891
his university studies at the University
of when us Aries and 1948 at the age of

57
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:57,500
20 he refused to involve himself with
the political movements against the

58
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:00,650
Peruvian government staying
focused on his studies.

59
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,690
He founds its rasping from academia on
the back of his 500 CC Norton motorcycle,

60
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,700
which he nicknames lap Ponderosa meaning
the mighty one. Yeah, it's chase.

61
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,550
First major excursion was
actually on the back of a bicycle,

62
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,860
one that he had fitted a small motor
team in 1950 he embarks on a solo track

63
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,890
across northern Argentina that would
see in pedaling some 2,800 miles a year

64
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,120
later,
he paired up with a university friends,

65
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:30,980
Alberto Grenada for a massive motorcycle
track across the South American

66
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:31,730
continents.

67
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,690
The two men traveled from one location
to another finding work as laborers as

68
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:39,050
they went at some pub. Lou, they
volunteered to work in a leper colony.

69
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,090
It was here.
Let's give our recalled.

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,870
Seeing the most impressive
example of solidarity and loyalty,

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,750
and this was among men who
had nothing materially.

72
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,790
He was also deeply affected by the intense
poverty that he saw in every corner

73
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,400
of the continents.
In his minds,

74
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,270
this was an indictment of the feeling
capitalist system throughout the 5,000

75
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:03,350
mile excursion Guevara. I kept a journal
in which he recorded his experiences.

76
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,730
These were later published as a book
which was entitled the Motorcycle Diaries

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,440
in the 1990s the motorcycle journey
proved to be a great turning points in

78
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:17,060
Guevaras life in 1960 he
wrote the following because
of the conditions in which

79
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:21,530
I traveled. I came into close contact
with poverty and hunger and disease.

80
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,130
I discovered that I was unable to cure
sick children through lack of means,

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,940
and they saw the degradation of under
nourishment and constant repression.

82
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,840
In this way.

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,700
I began to realize that there was another
thing that was as important as being a

84
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,750
famous researcher or making a great
contribution to medical science,

85
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,710
and that was to help people,
his experiences over the
course of his travels. Also,

86
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,910
it proven to Guevara that he could exist.
On very little.

87
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,360
He had the ability to push himself
forward despite food, water,

88
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,300
sleep or anything
materially these qualities,

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,890
what to make him an extremely effective
guerilla fighter Guevara and taken a

90
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,910
year sabbatical from his university
degree to embark upon his attic journey

91
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,660
returning.

92
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,310
He threw himself into his studies
graduating in 1953 to officially become a

93
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,170
doctor two months later,
however,

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,260
he abandons this career and
stepped into the political arena

95
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,060
with another friends, Carlos for
rec. Avara headed for Bolivia.

96
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,820
The country had just come under
his first reformed governments.

97
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,640
The big issue was the
nationalization of the countries.

98
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:29,810
10 lines or revolution was forming,

99
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:33,940
but che refused to be drawn in stating
that the revolutionaries were not

100
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:36,970
concerned with addressing
the causes of injustice,

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,230
but we're merely tinkering with the
effects rejecting the revolutionary

102
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:45,130
movements in Bolivia. Jay and
Carlos headed for Peru. Yeah.

103
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,370
They found that they were unable to
open any kinds of communication with the

104
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:51,520
down fraud, an Indian Sioux
according to Farrah standards,

105
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,820
lips as tight and for bidding as a
vice that refuse to to reply to our

106
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:59,980
questions. Still the Peruvian
border guards web. Sure.

107
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:04,330
That the two foreign upstarts sweat
forming some sort of agrarian revolution

108
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,980
from Peru. They traveled to Guatemala.
Yeah, I revolution had just taken pace.

109
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,220
Jay have not yet fully
developed a Marxist philosophy,

110
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,940
but he felt a personal responsibility
to help the downtrodden.

111
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,950
His challenge was to find a
workable way in order to do this,

112
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,530
the new revolutionary
government in Guatemala,

113
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:27,940
it was led by Hacobo Arbenz who had
managed to pull together a group of young

114
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,900
army officers and intellectuals.
As Jay arrived on the scene, I'll,

115
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,800
this was in the process of redistributing
lands that had been nationalized from

116
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,970
the American United Fruit company. That
hasn't work. It's the ever present.

117
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,910
Fear was that this would provoke a
counterrevolution revolution that would be

118
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,650
backed by the Americans.

119
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,520
Jay wanted to work as a doctor for the
Guatemalans in the jungles of Bhutan.

120
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,090
However, he would be required to
join the Guatemalan Labour party,

121
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,090
which was another name for
the local communist party.

122
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,570
She refuse to join painting that he
was a revolutionary and that that

123
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:03,571
designation superseded any political
affiliations of the Arbenz government only

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,480
lasted a year due to the fear and
American intervention becoming a reality.

125
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,810
The CIA trained and finance day
revolution, regrouping, managed,

126
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:14,950
do you asked the sitting government
courts in the middle of it all was Che

127
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,770
Guevara who commented,

128
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,420
and we are like the Spanish republic
betrayed from within and without,

129
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,260
but we did not for with the same dignity.
Finally,

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,980
he committed himself to revolution
reaction. Yet despite his best efforts,

131
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:31,840
he could not rally the Guatemalan people
for a consolidated defense. In the ends.

132
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,380
Arbenz weekly resigned.

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,270
She had been marked for execution by the
incoming regime and was forced to flee

134
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:42,160
to the Argentinian embassy where he
was holed up for almost two months.

135
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,940
His experiences in Guatemala Convinced
Chafe at America was the great enemy of

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,160
worldwide freedom and that capitalism
was holding people in a state of

137
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:52,060
subjugation.

138
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,910
It was at this point is that he began
to seriously study the of Marx and Lenin

139
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,470
from Argentina Che made from Mexico
where he began to develop his skills as a

140
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,350
revolutionary.
In 1955 he met Fidel Castro,

141
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,260
who had been exiled from
Cuba after a failed coup,

142
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,790
Castro was actively looking
for revolutionaries do
join a second attempt to

143
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,990
overthrow the regime of full Henslow.

144
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,850
Battista shaved like 20 herds and
he enthusiastically signed up.

145
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,010
The Cuban revolutionaries hadn't even
left Mexican show us when they were

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,030
intercepted by Mexican intelligence
services and thrown in prison.

147
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,240
It was Jay's first
experience of incarceration,

148
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,110
the screens of his fellow inmates as
they were being beaten and immersed in

149
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,050
water.
It had a powerful impact on Castro,

150
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:44,710
though he was able to exert influence
through the Russian embassy that got all

151
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:49,390
of the men released from 1956 the small
band of men were undergoing guerrilla

152
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:53,050
warfare training on the
Rancho San Miguel Halco.

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,700
Che proved to be the outstanding
students among the group despite his ever

154
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:01,060
present asthma, the att
revolutionaries, they sit out for Cuba.

155
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,040
On November the 25th 1956 on board
a dilapidated yacht called grandma.

156
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,640
None of the men onboard.

157
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,710
We're sailors and they all got seasick
with most of the suppliers being lost in

158
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,250
a storm.

159
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,770
They finally landed in a swampy area
that led to a mountain range in the south

160
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,660
east of Cuba for the next few weeks.
They wandered around somewhat aimlessly.

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,930
They found a guide,
but he betrayed them to Battista's forces.

162
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,490
The rebels were surrounded as they lounged
around in the jungle with their boots

163
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:32,440
off and weapons laid aside in the ensuing
fast on all but 12 of Castro's man,

164
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,590
they were wiped out. Castro,
he was wounded in the neck,

165
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,860
but he managed to escape with
four of his comrades. In doing so,

166
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,160
he had to make a fateful choice of this.
He later wrote.

167
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,760
This was perhaps the first time I had
to choose between my education for

168
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:48,880
medicine and my duty as
a revolutionary soldier.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,990
As my feet were a pack full of medicines
and the cartridge box together,

170
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,430
they were too heavy to carry.

171
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,970
I chose the cartridge box
leaving behind the Madsen pack.

172
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,590
J led his group to the Sierra, my strat
and meet up with any other survivors.

173
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,350
He used what he thought was
the north star to guide him,

174
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:09,310
but it was actually another star runs.
The group got hopelessly lost.

175
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,230
They eventually arrived
at the meeting place.

176
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,690
By sheer luck for the next few weeks,

177
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:17,680
the man had to rely on the generosity
of local peasants just to survive.

178
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,520
It was a small victory in the group
struggle to enlarge their numbers as they

179
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,950
settled into life in the
Sierra Maestra Mountains,

180
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,200
though few peasants join the rebellion,

181
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:29,050
they did build up a network
of sympathizes and he,

182
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,330
he showed any signs of
allegiance to the Patista.

183
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:35,140
Governments were put to death
often on the orders of Guevara.

184
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,730
It was during this time
that chain develops the cold
ruthlessness that he felt

185
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,960
was necessary to the makeup of a
revolutionary over the next two years.

186
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:48,961
He was to order the deaths of hundreds
of Patista followers by May of 1957 the

187
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:53,740
guerrilla force said the rebuilt to about
80 men and they had built a sizeable

188
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:57,520
cache of weapons they overcame than
other army barracks sins. Before long.

189
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,780
The entire Sierra Maestra region
has become a liberated zone,

190
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:05,380
whether he's does forces fear to go
during this time, that red alarm,

191
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:09,870
he had transformed itself from something
of a clueless mob to an actual season

192
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,780
to guerrilla force.

193
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,190
This was almost entirely due to the
training and the guidance of Che Guevara.

194
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,310
Castro had made him a commandant second
in rank only to himself as well as

195
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,490
training the men in fighting tactics.
He also established a field hospital,

196
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:27,040
the tailor's shop bakery,
and a printing shop.

197
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,240
You've are also set up a radio station
so that the rebels could speak directly

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,590
to the peasant population.

199
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,070
As a result of his prominent work at
the core of the red alarm egg Avara,

200
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,580
his name came to the attention of the
authorities being mentioned in the same

201
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:44,140
breath as the Castro brothers as an
enemy of the state within the group.

202
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,170
He also gone at his own loyal following
and in time he would become a threat to

203
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:53,860
Fidel himself. By the end of autumn
1958 the rebel force had one,

204
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,750
a series of victories
in the south of Cuba.

205
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,190
This precipitated Che's Long March
towards Havana during which is small but

206
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:03,940
determined forced travel by night and
attack to the villages and towns that they

207
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:06,070
encountered along the way during the day.

208
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,270
The ultimate objective was to gain
control of the province of last vs

209
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,910
effectively cutting Cuba and half.

210
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,640
Che proved himself to be
a brilliant tactician.

211
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,480
He perfected the art of setting up a
rule base is expanding them until a town

212
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:23,470
fell and then isolating cities and
squeezing the resistance sounds of it.

213
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,490
The final attack on the provinces
Capitol of Santa Clara involved a suicide

214
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:32,491
squad attack that soar as men outnumbered
10 to one the victory that resulted

215
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:37,570
was the most decisive battle in the
entire revolution with a rebel victory at

216
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,540
Santa Clara and the rebels heading
for the Capitol for Hensdale.

217
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,630
Battista knew the game was up.
He abandoned the country,

218
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,860
and on the 1st of January,

219
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:49,861
1959 headed for the Dominican Republic
with an alleged fortune of $300 million.

220
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,040
The next day, Jay enter Devonna like
a conquering hero. Fidel the rive.

221
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,850
Six days later to proclaim
there's a new era had begun.

222
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,120
The men who now inherited the governments
of Cuba where predominantly uneducated

223
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:14,530
and ill prepared for the task.
The clear exception was Che Guevara.

224
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,230
While he had no direct
governmental experience,

225
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:21,100
he was a university graduates who
were steeped in philosophical thought.

226
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,810
Further during the time in the mountains,

227
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,450
he had proven his ability
to organize Madden.

228
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,770
Surely organizing a country wouldn't
be much more difficult. As a result,

229
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,730
she became the brains of the new
governments for the next six years.

230
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:37,540
He remained in Cuba implementing his
own form of guerrilla governments.

231
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,630
His first focus was to shift Cuba from
an agrarian to an industrial society.

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,880
In order to become independent
from foreign imperialists,

233
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,220
Cuba had to become self sufficient.

234
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,730
J spoke less about the peasantry
and more about the urban worker.

235
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,080
In 1961 he was appointed minister of
Industry and instituted a program of

236
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,440
converting agricultural
implements into raw materials.

237
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,980
Too many people by such policies chain,
he was deserted.

238
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,510
The peasant class shape never appreciated
the complexity and its financial

239
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:11,330
resources that we needed
to set up new industries.

240
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,680
The factories that resulted ended up
producing goods that were of low quality

241
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,180
and high price.

242
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,130
By the end of 1964 Guevara had established
himself as an international expert on

243
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,550
revolution reaction. During a three
month world tour. He visited China,

244
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,950
North Korea, Algiers, Ghana, Tanzania,

245
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,750
and a few other countries espousing his
anticapitalist ideology and claiming

246
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:37,330
that the Cuban revolution was something
spiritual that would transcend all

247
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,173
boarders.

248
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,080
At the beginning of 1965 Guevara went
to the Congo to lend his support to the

249
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,750
revolutionary struggle
there for seven months.

250
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:48,200
He lands in Afro Cuban force of
about a hundred men. However,

251
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,290
his movements were constantly monitored
by the Kongo national army and the

252
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,880
American CIA and he was
unable to make any traction.

253
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,130
After spending time in Exxon at
the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam,

254
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,940
Jay quietly returned to Cuba.
Then in October,

255
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,020
1966 he slipped into Bolivia that he
believed that he could ferment an uprising

256
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:19,021
that would lead to the eventual overthrow
of imperialism throughout all of Latin

257
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:22,300
America during his time
in Bolivia Guevara cabs,

258
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:26,140
a detailed daily account
of his experiences which
had been published as the

259
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:30,970
Bolivian diaries via count reveals that
the specter of death was ever presence.

260
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,330
Though it is clear that he didn't
go to Bolivia wanting to get killed,

261
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,950
he was well aware for the odds of emerging
from the struggle alive were slim at

262
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:43,570
best. J and the Cubans who came with him
were not welcomed with open arms by fee

263
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:46,360
Bolivian revolutionaries.
The Bolivian Indians,

264
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:49,060
they distrusted the Cubans
as foreign white men.

265
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,620
As a result during the entire 11 months,

266
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:56,621
Che was unable to recruit a
single Bolivian Indian too
is cause Jay divided his

267
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,050
small rebel group into two divisions.

268
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,880
He likes the decisiveness and degression
of the actions that he had during the

269
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,000
Cuban revolution.

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He was also suffering physically at
this point with his asthmatic bounce,

271
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:07,834
becoming chronic,

272
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,040
still his resolve to go on and never
wanes as long as he could breathe.

273
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,323
You could fight.

274
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,350
Each rebel division was systematically
hunted down by the Bolivian forces.

275
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:22,360
On October the seventh 1967 and informants
led Bolivian special forces troops to

276
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,580
Castries camp in the euro ravine.

277
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,560
Almost 2000 soldiers surrounded the
camp and moved in for the kill ball,

278
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,820
but 10 men were killed.
Guevara throw up his hands and he yelled,

279
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,410
do not shoot. I am Che Guevara and I
am worth more to you alive and debt.

280
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,890
They were into. Jay was captured bounds
and taken to a nearby school house.

281
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,790
Attempts to interrogate and failed.
As he refused to speak.

282
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,090
One of the Bolivian soldiers present
recalled that Jay held his head high,

283
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,190
looked very one straight in the eye
and asked only for something to smoke.

284
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,500
A pipe was handed to j and d contently
puffed on it until they Bolivian officer

285
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,310
entered the room and
grabbed it from his mouth.

286
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,570
In response Guevara kicked out at the
officer on the morning of October,

287
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:07,110
the Ninth Guevara requested an
audience with the local school teacher.

288
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,430
The young woman was summons
and she listened respectfully.

289
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:14,400
As Che brought our attention to the
dilapidated condition of a school room and

290
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:18,530
contrasted it to the lavish conditions
which government officials enjoyed.

291

293
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,960

He was careful to inflict wounds in such
a way that the story could be told that

305
