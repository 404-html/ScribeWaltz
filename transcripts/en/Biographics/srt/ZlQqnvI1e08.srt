1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,760
Robert E.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:00,820
Lee.

3
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,180
Today,

4
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,720
the mere mention of his name was enough
to arouse passionate debate in his time.

5
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:08,200
He was loved and respected by both the
confederate army and the southern people.

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,100
Curiously,

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,330
following the civil war,

8
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,040
this high admiration carried over to
include the people of the north and Lee

9
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,140
became a cherished figure for
all Americans during the war.

10
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,180
When Abraham Lincoln
looked at a picture of Lee,

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,010
he remarked that a man with
such compassionate countenance
had to be a good man,

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,190
but the water which he devoted
his every fiber broken,

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,300
if not in spirit,

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,590
certainly in body.

15
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,840
And he was only to outlive the conflicts.

16
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,030
By five years into these biographics,

17
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:37,330
we discover the man who was Robert E.

18
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,163
Lee.

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,723
Okay.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,870
Robert E.

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,290
Lee was born on January the 19th
1807 at Stratford hall plantation in

22
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,250
Westmoreland County,

23
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,000
Virginia.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,540
His father,

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,250
they wealthy Virginia Aristocrat,

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,410
been a hero during the
American revolution,

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,910
a series of bad investments,

28
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,810
left light horse,

29
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:06,591
Harry penniless,

30
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:09,170
and he fled Virginia and
his family never to return.

31
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,910
I think it was raised by his mother,

32
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,100
uh,

33
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,410
prouds and educated woman.

34
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,460
She was to see the test son was not
to be deprived of a proper upbringing

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,820
because he was fatherless and she made
sure that he was well educated in the

36
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,740
arts languages and philosophy.

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,340
Young Robert Secures an appointment to
the United States Military Academy at

38
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,850
West Point in 1825 and see
graduated second in his class.

39
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,940
He immediately began his career
in the United States army.

40
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,020
They distinguished himself in the
Mexican war when he served as a member of

41
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,970
staff for fellow Virginia in general,

42
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,930
Winfield Scott as a captain,

43
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,040
[inaudible] was responsible for several
courageous personal reconnaissance

44
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:53,670
missions,

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,490
which produced intelligence
that led to American victories.

46
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,540
During this period,

47
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,490
the military had no medals for bravery,

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,320
so officers were given brevet promotions
for brave deeds during warfare APP.

49
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,280
Captain only received three of these,

50
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,040
prevents during the Mexican war to me,

51
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:11,160
Jeb to lieutenant colonel and finally to
Carnal sculpt describes me as the very

52
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:14,940
best soldier I ever saw in the fields
and they progress through a series of

53
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:18,300
military assignments in the peacetime
army and was in command of the first

54
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:22,200
cavalry in Texas at the beginning of the
civil war league or caught up early in

55
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:22,851
the political term.

56
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,530
All it was about to engulf the
nation while he was on leave.

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,910
From his position in Texas,

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,930
John Brown attacker to the armor is
Harper's ferry and events that clearly set

59
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,520
the nation on the road to walk.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,330
President Buchanan calls on leads take
command of a small federal force that

61
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,120
would be responsible for bringing
the situation under control,

62
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,700
Lee and a future subordinate.

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,730
He was also on leave.

64
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,720
Jaeb Stewart took command of a small
group of marines and it's captured the

65
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,400
insurgents along with brown as a nation
began to fracture bleed like most of his

66
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:54,300
contemporaries in the army was placed
in a difficult situation as it became

67
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:57,990
obvious that the southern states plan
to defend themselves with arms general.

68
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,481
Winfield,

69
00:02:58,481 --> 00:02:58,890
Scott,

70
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,520
the aging patriarch of the army.

71
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,391
Aj Lincoln,

72
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:01,541
too.

73
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,980
Awfully commander of the army.

74
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,300
Learning of this offer at least struggles
with the definition of duty does it

75
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,750
meant everything to him as an
officer in the United States army.

76
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,973
Yeah.

77
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,450
On April the 19th 1861 after
Virginia had quit the union,

78
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,180
Robert E.

79
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,390
Lee face the most difficult
decision of his life.

80
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,990
It's kept him up all night pacing the
wooden floor and the visit Arlington

81
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,230
Mansion.

82
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,320
Lee's daughter Mary courteously
recalls this that night.

83
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,210
Arlington was like a place where a death,

84
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,810
a ACAT.

85
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,020
The death in question was the end
of a brilliant military Korea.

86
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,830
Lee's wife,

87
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,320
Mary,

88
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,000
they to wrote,

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,210
my husband's has wept tears of
blood over this terrible war,

90
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,460
but as a man of honor
and does a Virginian,

91
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,600
he must follow the destiny of his State
is what was the severest struggle of his

92
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,020
life?

93
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,340
Do you resign a commission he had held
for 30 years to accept the command would

94
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,730
undoubtedly mean fighting against
his native Virginia and the south.

95
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,220
Something that he simply
couldn't bring himself to do.

96
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,790
Resignation from the army was also a
difficult choice to make and it does.

97
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,290
He wrestled with his decision.

98
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,130
He was attended by the prospects
of bloodshed on either side.

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,881
Finally,

100
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:15,540
he decided to resign his commission in
the army and attempt to to avoid service

101
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,880
with either side in the
forthcoming conflict,

102
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,810
Lee himself wrote with all my devotion
to the union and the feeling of loyalty

103
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,400
and duty of an American citizen,

104
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,990
I have not been able to make up my mind
to raise my hand against my relatives,

105
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,853
my children,

106
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,760
my home.

107
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,030
I have that for resigned my commission
in the army except in the defense of my

108
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:33,864
native state.

109
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,820
I hope to never draw my sword again.

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,370
This statements was to
prove to be prophetic.

111
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:38,970
On Monday,

112
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,150
they bought the 22nd 1861 Lee
left his home at Arlington,

113
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,070
never to return within two weeks,

114
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,791
union troops,

115
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,850
they occupied to south
Mary Hams there for girls.

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,200
They were vagabonds of war.

117
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,180
His three sons were soldiers in gray.

118
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,910
While Lee was in Richmond
planning the defense of Virginia.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,090
The general belief among politicians
in the south was that the war would be

120
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:57,750
short,

121
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,500
but Lee,

122
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,390
he believed otherwise he status.

123
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,010
If it comes to a conflict of arms,

124
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,230
the war will last at least four years.

125
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,040
Northern politicians do not appreciate
the determination and pluck of the south

126
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,950
and southern politicians do
not appreciate the numbers,

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,821
resources,

128
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:12,451
and it's patient.

129
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:13,800
Perseverance of the north.

130
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,260
Both sides forgets we are all Americans.

131
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,680
I foresee that the country will have
to pass through a terrible ordeal,

132
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,430
a necessary expiation perhaps
for our national sins.

133
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,343
Okay.

134
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,690
During the early days of the warrior,

135
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:38,410
it became apparent to me that the south
would fight a defensive war and that is

136
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,950
beloved Virginia would become the
major battlefield of that war.

137
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,020
He accepted a commission
as a commander of Virginia.

138
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,681
His troops,

139
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,860
and we're seeing commission does a
brigadier general in the confederate army.

140
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,460
He remains in relativity obscure positions
during the first year of the war as

141
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:55,420
he gained his earliest experiences in the
civil war in the mountainous region of

142
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,290
western Virginia.

143
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:56,890
Yeah.

144
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,930
The poor weather combines with the
political infighting between two of

145
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,280
Virginia's former governors.

146
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:05,450
Now generals resulted in disastrous
military failures for the confederacy.

147
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,781
Lee,

148
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,250
he was attacked in southern newspapers,

149
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,250
is evacuating Leeann's
granny leaves his hand runs,

150
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,660
isn't ubid tens gray during the tension
filled bouncing campaigns please.

151
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,530
Next assignment.

152
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:19,460
It was on the Carolina Sea coast where
he was responsible for building defenses

153
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,520
to prevents launch scale union
army attacks from the seat.

154
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,690
He placed his strong defensive positions
upstream where shallow rivers could not

155
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,460
be easily navigated by the union.

156
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:28,970
Navy.

157
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,010
Lee's ability as a military engineer
was proved by the fact that his defenses

158
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,790
will have to last for much of the war.

159
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,600
He was also nicknames the king of spades
because of the construction work that

160
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,434
he managed.

161
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,131
His detractors.

162
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,590
However,

163
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,450
what seems to realize their mistake
and misjudging this aggressive officer,

164
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,180
what is West Point classmates and
Joseph [inaudible] Johnson was severely

165
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,770
wounded at the battle of seven pines.

166
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:52,880
In June of 1862 linguists placed in
commands of what would soon become the

167
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:57,600
legendary army of Northern Virginia as
union general George Mcclellan advanced

168
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,130
towards the new confederate capital
Lee auditors' mandate to begin digging

169
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,460
defenses for Richmond's giving new
credence to one of his nicknames,

170
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,560
but he soon was to demonstrate
the audacious side of
his military personality.

171
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,810
Leah initiated the seven days campaign
on June the 25th 1862 and he had soon it

172
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,300
pushed the union army from
the outskirts of Richmond.

173
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,020
By August 29th he and his army were
positioned to do battle as Manassas,

174
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:21,591
Virginia,

175
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:25,160
where he defeated the Union army for a
second time before invading Maryland's.

176
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,970
This new commands of the confederate
army had completely changed the military

177
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:29,780
situation.

178
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,340
In only a few weeks.

179
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,851
In June,

180
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,580
the entire union army had been
poised to attack Richmond's,

181
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,270
but by September he was in a position
from which you could threaten Washington,

182
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,930
DC.

183
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,050
Lee's army fought to a stalemate at the
battle of Antietam and on September the

184
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,350
17th and withdrew to the southern
side of the potter Mac in December,

185
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:50,351
but he was able to conclude the 1862
campaign with a major victory of Ambrose

186
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,340
Burnside's Union forces at Fredericksburg,

187
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,000
Virginia,

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,040
sending the northern army reeling back
to their basis now Washington Lee and

189
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,370
this hard marching subordinate,

190
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,630
stonewall Jackson were able to defeat a
larger union army under Joseph Hooker at

191
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:06,980
Chancellorsville in the first campaign
of 1863 but the victory was costly.

192
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,610
Jackson was fatally wounded by his
own men while conducting a personal

193
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,230
recognizance of the enemy's lines.

194
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,050
This was actually a common feature
of good confederate commanders.

195
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,860
They would actually conduct that own
recognizance during a lull in the battle

196
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,560
viewed as unnecessary
bravado by some historians.

197
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,740
This was actually a key to the
successful operations of the confederate

198
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:28,820
commanders and Lee himself frequently
under Tareq of these hazardous operations.

199
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,070
Favorite sounds from a personal
battlefield reconnaissance.

200
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,210
That second Manassas with a mark
on his face where a sharp shooters,

201
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,270
bullets at grace,

202
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,660
Devon lease immediate reactions of the
death of his most trusted officer was

203
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:42,260
that it was God's wealth and the Lord
would raise someone else up to Jackson's

204
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,340
place and that's hope.

205
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:43,910
However,

206
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,743
he was mistaken,

207
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,360
Lee would just have to do
the best he could by himself.

208
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,320
At Chancellorsville.

209
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,110
These cemented his reputation
as a brilliant brilliance
battlefield commander.

210
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,260
It was a battle that seemingly
on paper he could not win,

211
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,680
outnumbered this two to one.

212
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,440
He's still divided his army in
half in the face of the enemy.

213
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,700
He won the battle in spectacular fashion
and it was undoubtedly has most famous

214
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,480
victory.

215
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,630
The victory of Chancellorsville cleared
the way for another confederate invasion

216
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:10,140
of the north confusion within the Union
army combined with the losses of the

217
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,310
earlier basil gave,

218
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,180
leave the opportunity.

219
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:16,500
He longed for a chance to destroy the
union army in a classic and Napoleonic

220
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,840
battle that would end the civil war.

221
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,550
This was a high risk operation,

222
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:24,560
but Lee placed great faith in the ability
of his army of northern Virginia and

223
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,380
to get his bag.

224
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,270
This is where he would
attempt to do it again.

225
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,580
Okay.

226
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,350
In June of 1863 lead boldly moved his
army of nearly 60,000 men into union

227
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:43,100
territory.

228
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,550
His plan was to destroy as many military
posts does he could in Maryland and

229
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,384
Pennsylvania.

230
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,270
While the Union army was
forced to defend Washington DC,

231
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,090
a key target Swisscom curtain
just outside of Harrisburg,

232
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:53,924
Pennsylvania.

233
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,570
This was the largest military
supply depot in the north.

234
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,750
I think his main aim was not to
defeat to the union army militarily,

235
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,910
but to bring the water
and ends politically.

236
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,660
He believed that a massive defeat in
the north would encourage people to lose

237
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:07,610
faith in the warm and demand it's cents.

238
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,121
However,

239
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:10,070
as the confederate forces move north,

240
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,570
a skirmish erupted in Gettysburg,

241
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:14,120
Pennsylvania between
opposing cavalry units,

242
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,820
legal word of the skirmish and
were startled to be informed.

243
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,640
There's a major union force
was closing it on Guettas back.

244
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,330
Instead of sending a
cavalry reconnaissance force
to confirm the report,

245
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,060
he sent his entire army to mobilize.

246
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,780
This is something that history
would record as a colossal mistake.

247
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,591
The audit,

248
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:34,010
all of his forces to converge at cash
down that small village seven miles from

249
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:34,800
gutters back.

250
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,530
That's the 60,000 confederates port.

251
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:40,280
In around 3000 union soldiers
took position on Macpherson Ridge.

252
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,330
These men trying to hold off the onslaught
of rebel soldiers until help arrived,

253
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,400
but reinforcements were miles away.

254
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,510
In Washington DC,

255
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,470
the union soldiers,

256
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:51,200
they were forced to withdraw
southeast on the cemetery Ridge,

257
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,030
a range of hills on the outskirts of
Gettysburg that forms the shape of a fish

258
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:55,580
hook.

259
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,030
This position provided an extremely
strong defensive advantage.

260
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,030
Lee immediately saw the danger in
the strength of the union position,

261
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,980
but because of his numerical superiority,

262
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,230
he believed that the enemy was vulnerable.

263
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,710
However,

264
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,490
union forces sooner arrived and
strengthens their defensive position.

265
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,950
Though it was nowhere
near Lee's bass campaign,

266
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,390
much of what happened to get his bag,

267
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,730
we're still remarkable from
a southern perspective,

268
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,950
Lee was our numbers ends
without much of his cavalry.

269
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,820
The cavalry was used largely
for reconnaissance in
order to find the enemy and

270
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:24,650
establish his size and strength.

271
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,210
But Lee's calvary regiments were in the
process of reading the entire union army

272
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,110
rather than gathering information and
screening the flanks of Lee's army,

273
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,020
and he was also without his
most trusted officer at general,

274
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,520
Thomas Stonewall Jackson,

275
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,250
who had been killed at
Chancellorsville six weeks earlier,

276
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,240
still let you failed to
adjust your strategy to the
situation on the grounds he

277
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:47,720
refused to retreat even when the
situation was clearly hopeless.

278
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,080
After three days of terrible
fighting and unprecedented losses,

279
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,730
the confederates were forced to withdraw
from the fields and to make a hasty

280
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,350
retreat from the northern territory.

281
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,950
As the survivors of the disastrous
attack that history remembers,

282
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,890
his pickets challenge came fleeing
back to the southern position,

283
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,640
the general road among the men trying to
console them and admitting that it was

284
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,540
all his faults.

285
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,830
In later reflection,

286
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,350
they admitted that he had simply asked
too much of his men at Gettysburg.

287
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,300
He wrote,

288
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,660
no blame can be attached to the army
for its failure to accomplish what was

289
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,800
projected by me.

290
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,720
I am alone to blame.

291
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,290
Gettysburg was Lee's greatest
wartime disappointments in its way.

292
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,980
He tended his resignation
as you confederate President
Jefferson Davis rising.

293
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,053
Mr President.

294
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,660
No one is more than myself and my
inability for the duties of my position.

295
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,970
I cannot even accomplish
what I myself desire.

296
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,280
How can I fulfill the
expectations of others?

297
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,060
In addition,

298
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,420
I sensibly feel v growing
failure of my bodily strength.

299
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,220
This was no idle self pitying,

300
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:42,821
the civil war,

301
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:45,020
and in particular the battle
of Gettysburg Broccoli.

302
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,760
Physically.

303
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,850
There is good evidence that to just
before the Bassel he actually had a heart

304
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,410
attack.

305
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,751
Still.

306
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,890
Davis refused to accept his resignation
knowing that the man was irreplaceable.

307
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,030
Following Gettysburg,

308
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,180
the retreated across the potter Mac
never to return to the north again.

309
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,171
The following spring,

310
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,900
a new Yankee general came
to the fields to fight leap.

311
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,600
His name was Ulysses Simpson grants.

312
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,231
Finally,

313
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:08,500
the North had founds a worthy contender
for the great confederate general.

314
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,940
Unlike many of his predecessors,

315
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:11,530
groms was not covered by lead.

316
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,330
Both men underestimated each other,

317
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,630
seemed discovering that their opponents
was different from anyone else that had

318
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,560
ever been up against.

319
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,770
Immediately upon taking commands at
grant issued the following commands do

320
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:21,604
general needs,

321
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,810
commander of the army of the potter Mac
Lee's army will be your objective points

322
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,880
wherever ligos there you will go.

323
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:28,714
Also,

324
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,160
grants relentlessly pursued Lee from the
wilderness to Spotsylvania and then to

325
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:36,940
cold harbor wearing terrible slaughter
took place throughout the bloody campaign

326
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,170
and despite heavy losses,

327
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,760
Lee Galleon Lee led his army on May the
sixth 1864 is his line was wavering.

328
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,480
He himself rode to the front and demanded
that his men stand their ground on the

329
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,040
very dangerous circumstances.

330
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,480
After June,

331
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,720
1864 Lee's army of northern Virginia
had been pushed back to the defenses of

332
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:53,920
Richmond's and back.

333
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,671
Effectively.

334
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:56,290
Grants had taken him out of the war,

335
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,370
unable to maneuver and know where to
go or they could do now was wait and to

336
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,680
react as grant circling around him,

337
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:07,480
access with his army besieged and pin
down the knew that the end was in sight.

338
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,230
Lee's anguish while being hemmed up at
Petersburg was heightens with the news

339
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:14,800
that his home in Arlington
had been confiscated by the
union governments having

340
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,240
been seized for unpaid taxes.

341
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,090
It was quickly converted into
a large soldiers' cemetery.

342
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,300
Orders were given for the graves to be
placed as close to the house as possible

343
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,970
so that it could never be used
again as a private dwelling.

344
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,541
However,

345
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,550
the cruelest bro,

346
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,610
but it was yet to come through the
winter of 1864 Lee's army lacked forage

347
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:34,600
rations and supplies somehow managed
to retain their fighting spirit,

348
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,130
but even that's was to disappear in
April of 1865 with his men that are near

349
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,060
starvation point,

350
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,020
Lee led his bedraggled army to Appomattox
courthouse in Virginia following a

351
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,380
last desperate flight from Richmond and
it was there that Lee surrendered his

352
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:49,270
army and ended the civil war.

353
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,700
The correspondence between grants and
lead during those closing hours of the war

354
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,540
is enlightening.

355
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,080
On April the seventh grants sent the
following message to leave general.

356
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,680
The results of the last week must convince
you of the hopelessness of further

357
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,940
resistance in this struggle.

358
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,750
I regarded it as my duty to shift from
myself the responsibility of any further

359
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:09,470
a fusion of blood by asking of you
the surrender of the army of northern

360
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:10,220
Virginia.

361
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,270
Very respectfully.

362
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,530
You s grants,

363
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,910
Lee's reply.

364
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,870
It came swiftly.

365
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,140
General grants though not entertaining
the option you express on the

366
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,590
hopelessness of further resistance on the
part of the army of northern Virginia.

367
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,360
I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless
a fusion of bloods and therefore ask

368
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,850
the terms you will offer in
condition if it's surrender.

369
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,110
Very respectfully.

370
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,100
Robert E.

371
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,490
Lee.

372
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,760
On the morning of April the ninth Lee
put on his best uniform and went to the

373
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,280
home of Wilmer Mclean
where he met general grant.

374
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,100
The two men contrasted
sharply Lee six feet high,

375
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,170
ends with faultless form and dress grants.

376
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:45,150
Five foot seven mud splatters
as in a rumpled private,

377
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,820
so uniform the terms of Sorento.

378
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,100
While unexpectedly generous
without demand for punishment,

379
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:52,130
the confederate army was allowed to go
home on the provision that they would

380
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,440
never take up arms again
against the federal governments.

381
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,590
Many historians believed that it was
a measure of grants respectfully,

382
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,420
that he handled the terms the way he did.

383
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,760
As he exited the Mclean House,

384
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,100
Lee was chaired by the confederates
and saluted by the union troops,

385
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,940
asked officer of the Union to
remove his hat and saluted.

386
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,020
Lee was grants.

387
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,443
Yeah.

388
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,960
After the war,

389
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,810
he became president,

390
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,420
so of Washington College in Lexington,

391
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:21,990
Virginia.

392
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,681
During those years,

393
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,010
he also found time to write his memoir
and in it he stated the following,

394
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,940
I did only what my duty demanded.

395
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,240
I could have taken no other
course without dishonor,

396
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,850
and if at all were to be done over again,

397
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,310
I should act in precisely the same manner.

398
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,680
He dedicated his last years to education.

399
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,880
On September the 28th 1870 he went to
a school meeting on the way home and he

400
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:42,714
caught a Kohl's.

401
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,800
14 days later,

402
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,610
he died.

403
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,270
The huge funeral service at Lexington
was attended by thousands of Americans

404
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,130
from both the north and the south.

405
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,930
So I really hope you found that biography.

406
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,471
Interesting.

407
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,131
