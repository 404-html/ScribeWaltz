1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,531
Oh,

2
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:01,364
Richard Branson.

3
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,630
Well,

4
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,151
is there anything,

5
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:06,020
he doesn't do high school dropouts at
the age of 16 he started companies.

6
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:09,860
He's seen the wells and he has more
adventures than anyone could dream of in a

7
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:10,694
lifetime.

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,660
He's a creative personality and a
brilliant businessmen as well as being an

9
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,300
energetic charitable man
who has built a brand,

10
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,000
a recognizable around the world.

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,430
I Adams,

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:19,761
by the way,

13
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:22,490
he's also worth nearly $5 billion.

14
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,450
So how exactly did Branson
gets to where he is today?

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,850
Let's start at the
beginning of the 1950s in,

16
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:45,360
sorry.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,410
England's Branson was born at the
eldest son of Edward and Eve Branson,

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,880
a lawyer and a flight attendance.

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,260
Though she was a flight attendant,

20
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,990
Eve Branson didn't sit
idly by on their days off.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,740
She built a wooden trash cans and tissue
boxes selling them for extra money for

22
00:00:58,741 --> 00:00:59,490
the family.

23
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,330
Watching his mother's success builds
Branson's admiration for entrepreneurs and

24
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,300
gave them an option for when
school just wasn't working out.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,810
She was always supportive of him and was
even known to tell people he would one

26
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:11,460
day be prime minister of England.

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,270
His mother was also an influence on
Branson's active minds and his lifestyle

28
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,940
that have become so much a part
of his international brand today.

29
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,620
She didn't let her children watch TV.

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,420
Instead of pushing her son
and two daughters outside
to entertain themselves and

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,190
make themselves useful
though clearly brilliant.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,720
Branson was not a successful students
who have dyslexia and growing up school.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,650
That was difficult for him,

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,510
but this Lexia did not stop him and
now he credits it as a key part of his

35
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,620
formula for success.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,060
If you have a learning disability,

37
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,900
you become a very good delegator because
you know what your weaknesses are and

38
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,830
you know what your strengths are and you
make sure that you find great people to

39
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:49,020
step in and deal with your weaknesses.

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,420
He moved through several
schools as a child,

41
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,280
eventually giving up on institutionalized
learning at the age of 16 but he did

42
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:57,690
not give up on achieving.

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,010
When he dropped out of school,

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,250
he already knew that being an entrepreneur
that was the right life for him.

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,480
He started out with an idea and it's
with an ultimate goal far beyond just

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,410
earning money.

47
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,480
From my very first day as an entrepreneur,

48
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,100
I felt the only mission worth pursuing
in business is to make people's lives

49
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,934
better.

50
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,360
His first venture as a teenage businessmen
who was publishing a magazine called

51
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,140
students.

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,190
I took me 16 years old with no input
or work for anyone but students.

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,300
Ranson was able to secure $8,000
in advertising for the magazines.

54
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,134
First issue,

55
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,230
this was 1966 and $8,000 was a lot more
money them so much in fact that Branson

56
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,270
didn't even have to sell the first issue.

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,811
Instead,

58
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:38,850
he gave away 50,000 copies,

59
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,170
building the brand's name,

60
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:40,450
Andy,

61
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,050
potentially loyal customer
base for future issues.

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,430
It was the first demonstration of a
brilliant business mind with an utterly

63
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,860
impressive talent for marketing students.

64
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,110
It continued in its original
form for three years,

65
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,880
but in 1969 Branson,

66
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,390
he felt the urge to make it even bigger
and to take it in a new direction.

67
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,330
Advertisements for records were a
large part of the magazine's revenue,

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,960
so Branson took records and the
magazine and put them together.

69
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,591
Essentially,

70
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,770
he spotted a gap in the
market for mail order record.

71
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,430
Sales,

72
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,090
his man order business when
it was Christians with a
name that we all know today

73
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,410
and that would be virgin,

74
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,870
but it wasn't actually Richard
Branson who came up with that name.

75
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,580
It was one of his first employees.

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,810
Though they were successful,

77
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,220
the name was perfect for the company.

78
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,320
As all of the young
people involved in this,

79
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,520
when you to business,

80
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,413
well that name,

81
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,980
it obviously stuck and to now it's come
to wrap present much more than just mail

82
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,440
order music though the
mail order business.

83
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,160
It was popular,

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,630
it wasn't making enough money to stay
afloat and Branson when he needed cash,

85
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,260
he decided that the best way to do that
was avoided giving the government of the

86
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,110
entire share of the taxes
that he actually owed.

87
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,470
You cannot with a scheme through which
he avoided reporting all of the records

88
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,370
that were sold in the UK falsifying the
numbers of those that were exported.

89
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,090
It sounded good and it
did bring in cash birth.

90
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:59,080
Well it was discovered and we actually
ended up in jail and having to pay over

91
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,880
$60,000 in fines.

92
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,620
This obstacle and a short time in jail
didn't slow him or his business ambitions

93
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,454
down though,

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,140
even with the tax fraud scandal,

95
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,650
it was only less than two years after
starting the man or the record business

96
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,740
that Branson was able to take yet another
leap in 1971 he opens an actual bricks

97
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,150
and mortar store in order to sell records.

98
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,570
Then it was only a year before he bought
himself a high in and was able to build

99
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,420
a recording studio in [inaudible].

100
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,780
Now that he had a studio,

101
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,890
the next logical step,

102
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,450
it was to start a record label.

103
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,380
So he looked around and ended up signing
an artist he thought would be okay,

104
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,610
but not likely to have overwhelming
success as no one else would take him on.

105
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,790
And so what was the name of
this newly created record label?

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,100
But of course it was a virgin records.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
The label had success almost
immediately with its first artist,

108
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,110
Mike Oldfield staying on the chance with
the album tubular bells for nearly five

109
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,944
years.

110
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,390
To put this in perspective.

111
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,380
The record was on the charts as along as
it took from Branson to go from selling

112
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:59,530
records by mail to having
his own record label.

113
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,520
The success of Oldfield and Branson under
the upstart virgin ladle bit didn't go

114
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,960
unnoticed far from it.

115
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,760
Huge names like the sex pistols,

116
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,110
the rolling stones culture club,

117
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,490
Janet Jackson and Genesis.

118
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,920
They were all later signed onto the label.

119
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,754
Yeah,

120
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,080
drown the 1970s while Bronson was in his
twenties he focused on his ever-growing

121
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,150
music business,

122
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,290
but by 1984 he was again
itching to try something new,

123
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,010
so he took what seems like a pretty
large jump across industries.

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,840
He invested in a new airline business
before launching the full fledged airline

125
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:40,380
service.

126
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,000
Branson had realized the potential for
doing so when his own flights to the

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,590
British Virgin Islands was
canceled being wealthy.

128
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,850
They didn't have to wait around.

129
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:50,310
There's an APP or for the next
flight at the whim of the airlines,

130
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,260
he could charter his own plane.

131
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,280
So he did it,

132
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,650
but he didn't keep the
launch plan to himself.

133
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,430
Instead,

134
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,440
he charged the others.

135
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,260
He was supposed to be on his original
flight to the British Virgin Islands,

136
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,520
a smaller fee and they all flew together
on a chartered plane down to the island

137
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,280
is creative minds and business intuition.

138
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,190
They saw an opportunity here and Branson,

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,930
well he was ready to seize it.

140
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,710
Soon after his initial experimental
charter flight to the British Virgin

141
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,800
Islands,

142
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,880
he called up Boeing and ask what they had
for sale while they said that they had

143
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,620
a Boeing seven four seven available lands,

144
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:26,621
Branson bought it and this was the start
of his fleet of airplanes as he has

145
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,370
with the man or to record business.

146
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,570
Branson's saw a need and a way that he
could run a business better than others

147
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,950
who were currently doing so.

148
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,630
So Entry Richard Branson style.

149
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,920
They did just that.

150
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,340
We just made it that much more special
than the other airlines we were competing

151
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:40,700
with.

152
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,400
He says of what he achieved
with Virgin Atlantic Airways.

153
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,810
Long before it was the norm,

154
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:48,650
virgin was offering such luxuries as
individual TV screens to help people pass

155
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,760
the time on flights.

156
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,361
Now.

157
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:53,960
Initially virgin it operates is only
out of London's Gatwick Airport,

158
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,740
but by 1991 it had grown to the point
where it was given permission to fly out

159
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,660
of Heathrow British Airways.

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,990
Well,

161
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,220
they were not say pleased by this new
threats to their previously unchallenged

162
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,310
supremacy and they certainly did not sit
idly by while virgin kept gobbling off

163
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,694
the market show.

164
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,280
In 1993 virgin is accused of
British Airways of he's so cool.

165
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:19,281
Series of dirty tricks that ranged from
computer hacking to reliable following

166
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,361
the accusations,

167
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,051
British Airways,

168
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:25,550
they settled over at nearly $4 million
in legal fees and compensation.

169
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,391
Now you might be wondering,

170
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:26,541
well,

171
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,720
what did Branson do with the money
that he received in the settlements?

172
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,060
Well,

173
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,150
he didn't just stick it all
in his own bank accounts.

174
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,530
Instead he decided to share it with virgin
is employees now they the settlement.

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,640
It was a win for the company.

176
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,450
It didn't mean virgin and Branson were
completely successful and just had

177
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,440
nothing to worry about us.

178
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,281
On the contrary,

179
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:43,760
in fact,

180
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,450
Branson was unfortunately forced to sell
his music business in order to keep his

181
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,284
empire going.

182
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,130
Emi.

183
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,630
They bought virgin records in 1992 and
although it was a good business decision,

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,880
it was a tough personal
choice for Branson.

185
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,893
The music business,

186
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,310
it was Branson's baby,

187
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,060
it was his first venture and he was the
reason everything else he had built was

188
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:02,750
possible.

189
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,471
Over the years,

190
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,830
he's been very open about just how
difficult that sale was for him.

191
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,760
I mean,

192
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,320
you build something from scratch.

193
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,090
We had just signed Janet Jackson,

194
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,570
we had signed the rolling stones when
we sold it and I remember running down

195
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:19,220
Ladbroke grove tears streaming down
my face with a check for $1 billion.

196
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,130
Since the sale,

197
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,110
Virgin Airlines has
continued to grow brands,

198
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,621
so now today,

199
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:26,330
cell phone sector to his business and
then a space travel venture called a

200
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,350
virgin galactic.

201
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,880
500 people have bought tickets,

202
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,570
have an as yet unscheduled flight
into space with Virgin Galactic.

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,411
Overall,

204
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:37,490
Richard Branson owns 200 companies
linked to the virgin brands,

205
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,990
but well business,

206
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,840
it's not his only interest
and nor is it his own

207
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,150
Branson.

208
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,190
He could just sit
comfortably in his island,

209
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
resort home.

210
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,791
That's well,

211
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:01,650
he prefers to explore all corners of
the welds and to do so in ways far more

212
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,910
interesting and it's far more powerless
than in the comfort of a Virgin Atlantic

213
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,600
plane.

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,740
He's flashy than your average billionaire
with no qualms about risking his life

215
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:14,520
and the pursuit of adventure adventure
that also serves double duty as he can

216
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,890
beat the out of the
box marketing strategy.

217
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,040
He makes no distinction
between his professional lens,

218
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,000
personal endeavors,

219
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,600
simply aiming to enjoy life and it's
making a difference where he can.

220
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,300
I don't think of work as
work and to play as play.

221
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,880
It's all living well.

222
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:34,260
In 1985 Richard Branson made international
news when he tried to set a world

223
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,750
record for the fastest
crossing of the Atlantic.

224
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,800
They failed in totally spectacular fashion
as his boat capsized and he had to be

225
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,050
rescued by eight British
military helicopter.

226
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,831
Is that of this?

227
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,750
Do not be embarrassed by your failures.

228
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,240
Learn from them and start again as well.

229
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,980
Again in Branson's true form here,

230
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,521
absolutely.

231
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:50,940
Desk.

232
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,580
In 1986 he attempted to the
Atlantic crossing again,

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,520
but this time he succeeded
in spectacular fashion.

234
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,480
He broke the world record for
the crossing by over two hours.

235
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,770
But breaking this record,

236
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,041
well,

237
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,480
it wasn't enough for Branson.

238
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:07,560
He wanted more adventure and he also
wants to keep his name and the virgin his

239
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,760
name in the news.

240
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,050
It doesn't a water crossing,

241
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,230
but now we wanted to
move on to our airplanes.

242
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,490
They were not exciting enough,

243
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,300
so we opted to cross the Atlantic
in a hot air balloon and then,

244
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,350
I mean crossing the Atlantic,

245
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:19,891
it wasn't enough.

246
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,230
So he decided to cross the
Pacific in a hot air balloon.

247
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,380
Now it wasn't all purely for the pursuit
of adventure that he took on these hot

248
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:29,640
air balloon challenges actually truly
enjoy traveling by hot air balloon.

249
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,520
He says,

250
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,730
my favorite mode of transport
is hot air ballooning.

251
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,960
It's so graceful to be blown by the
winds to go where the wind takes you.

252
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,390
Now the balloon Branson
took on his first flight.

253
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,030
It was a record breaker in and of itself.

254
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,770
It was the size of a 21
looks story building and it
was built to fly to speed of

255
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,780
over 200 miles per hour.

256
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,220
It was simply the largest and the
fastest balloon ever constructed,

257
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,001
large and vast.

258
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,670
They didn't make that
balloon immune from danger.

259
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,540
The flights path was from the state of
Maine to islands as when the balloon

260
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,321
reached islands.

261
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,030
It didn't attach as it was supposed to.

262
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:03,740
Instead,

263
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,260
Branson and his crew found themselves
dipping into the freezing waters of the

264
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:07,890
Atlantic.

265
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,480
His crew jumped out of the balloon,

266
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:13,650
but Branson was forced to stay put after
the balloon rapidly lifted to 12,000

267
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,840
feet with him still in us terrified,

268
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,280
but able to remain calm.

269
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,240
Ranson navigated the balloon back down
towards the water and jumped into the

270
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:21,571
ocean.

271
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:22,020
When he saw her,

272
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,170
he was just a few dozen feet above its
surface and now let's move on to the

273
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:27,390
Pacific blue trip because
this wasn't much calmer.

274
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,960
They ran out of most of their fuel
partway through and they were dependent on

275
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,240
the jet stream to simply
push them forward.

276
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,133
Branson said,

277
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,070
I was facing almost certain death we
could have just slumped on the floor and

278
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:41,820
accepted our face or try
to fly the balloon into the
core of the jet stream and

279
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,590
finds the strongest winds you can find.

280
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,880
Stay awake for three days
and do everything you can
to avoid what on paper looks

281
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,920
like a sad ending Branson's crew.

282
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,280
Well,

283
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,300
they chose to stay away.

284
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,550
You can do what they could and
as they overcame that challenge,

285
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,150
they didn't break the
records they hope to,

286
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,220
but they did live to tell the town of
their adventure and that was all they

287
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:00,941
could have asked for it.

288
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:01,060
That,

289
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,893
okay,

290
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,800
School Amanda,

291
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,020
like Branson who devotes much of
his life to the pursuit of pleasure,

292
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:18,770
rent growing your business might seem to
be pretty full up on time commitments,

293
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,701
but for Branson,

294
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:20,960
business and success,

295
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,660
it's about much more than
just amassing wealth.

296
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,190
It's about helping people.

297
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,770
I never started out in
business to make money.

298
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,100
I wanted to create products that
made a difference in people's lives.

299
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,200
The same is true today in my opinion.

300
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,180
There's nothing quite
like the gift of giving.

301
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,490
When you see firsthand
the impacts it can have,

302
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,340
it becomes the best feeling in the world.

303
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,680
Branson has used not only his money,

304
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,770
but his brands in his new sobriety
to influence world leaders.

305
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,890
He and Peter Gabriel of the virgin records
span genesis talk to Nelson Mandela

306
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:53,150
or about their dream of having a group
of world leaders for them to work on the

307
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:55,550
pressing issues facing
the people of the world.

308
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,020
What,

309
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
what was the result of that?

310
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,320
Well,

311
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,110
that would be the group,

312
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,821
the elders,

313
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,490
a group of some of the world's
most respected former leaders,

314
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,870
including UN officials,

315
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,150
president Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu,

316
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,051
Branson.

317
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,270
He does provide funding for
the group and its initiatives,

318
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,080
but it was really his initial idea and
his willingness to Karen's have those

319
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:15,020
initial conversations that
really made this all possible.

320
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,640
And then we come to environmental issues,

321
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,800
which are one of Branson's
personal passions.

322
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,230
He's committed to hundreds of millions
of pounds to fighting global warming and

323
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:26,120
to even hosted a summit at his private
island in 2009 they might have the

324
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:26,570
question,

325
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,630
why does Richard Branson care about
preserving the earth and its beauty quite

326
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:30,260
some much?

327
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,590
Well,

328
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,640
like as creative beds,

329
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,820
Branson credits his childhood home and
the amount of time he spent playing

330
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:35,750
outside of this.

331
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,590
I was fortunate to have been brought up
in the countryside in a little cottage.

332
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,620
I suppose that the first 10 years of
my life were spent in the countryside,

333
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,250
biking,

334
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,120
climbing trees,

335
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,320
and didn't touch with nature.

336
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,660
I suppose that's where my
enough of nature started.

337
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,561
Overall,

338
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,780
he's worked with dozens
of charities in his life,

339
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,500
dedicating his time and his money to
the causes that he cares most about.

340
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,960
The United Nations has even
recognized his efforts,

341
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,160
giving him the citizen of the
world award in 2007 most recently,

342
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,670
Branson has thrown his charitable energy
towards helping the Caribbean islands

343
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:09,080
rebuild in the wake of Hurricane Irma
is destruction during the fall of 2017

344
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,960
with his home on Necker island
in the British Virgin Islands.

345
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,000
He has a personal interest in doing so,

346
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,600
but it's gone well beyond just
rebuilding his own luxurious home.

347
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,690
He spent time helping mobilize
rescue efforts and assisting with the

348
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:22,280
distribution of water and supplies,

349
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,260
as well as helping people find shelter.

350
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:24,890
Clearly,

351
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,050
Branson is not a man to stand idly by
when there is a need or opportunity.

352
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,893
Yeah.

353
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,310
In promoting the virgin brands and
promoting the courses he cares about.

354
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,080
Branson has become a highly recognizable
personality and a frequent guest on

355
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,250
news and other shows,

356
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,250
but he doesn't always stick to the
serious stuff he's made in the bond film.

357
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,070
Casino Royale and cement to
displace isn't nineties icon.

358
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,440
When he started on both
Baywatch and friends,

359
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,460
he was also featured in the iconic apple
think different towns alongside such

360
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,840
luminaries as John Lennon.

361
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,780
Gandy Einstein and public
[inaudible] Richard Branson.

362
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,000
He's not your typical uptake businessmen.

363
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,510
He's a creative luminary who was
impacted all the corners of business and

364
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,750
impacted many parts of the world
and that's what he aims to do.

365
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,470
Each day he wants to put the things he's
passionate about to work for himself

366
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,610
and for the world.

367
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,600
A passionate belief in your business
and personal objectives can make all the

368
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:27,470
difference between success and failure
if you aren't proud of what you're doing.

369
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,730
Why should anybody else there?

370
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,950
Amid everything Branson,

371
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:42,140
there's also found time to
marry and have children.

372
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,680
His first marriage was in the heyday of
virgin records when he went to Kristin

373
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:49,800
to Massey in 1972 that marriage blessed
him don't be seven years and the couple

374
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:54,360
of divorced in 1979 Branson had
already met his second wife Templeman.

375
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,010
By the time he and Tom Massey divorced
and his grandson admitted as much later

376
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:58,844
to piers Morgan,

377
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,060
he had a daughter with
Templeman in 1979 sadly,

378
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,160
I'm Charlie lived for only four days.

379
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,330
It wasn't until 10 years and two more
children later that Branson and Templeman

380
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,630
actually tied the knot.

381
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,480
Richard Branson.

382
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
He could have continued to struggle
through high school doing things he hated

383
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:24,740
and that he didn't care about.

384
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,310
He could have fought his way to becoming
a lawyer like his dad or settling into

385
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:31,160
a middle class office job in
London or the surrounding area.

386
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,930
He could have stuck it out,

387
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,780
but he listened to his instincts
and he went with his heart,

388
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,650
a drop house.

389
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,170
He could have fallen to the
bottom and struggled through life,

390
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,250
feeling sorry for himself,

391
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,660
for having a learning disability,

392
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,290
but it's passion and his personality
along with his mother's constant

393
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,690
encouragement propelled him forward.

394
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,880
Richard Branson drew on his creativity,

395
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,580
took risks and never
shied from a challenge.

396
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,000
Every time he failed you brushed
himself off and try it again.

397
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,380
He gives back to a wells that has given
him much and he continues to succeed as

398
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:03,200
a businessman and as
an admired personality.

399
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,710
Richard Branson once said that if
you want to stand out from the crowd,

400
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,140
give people a reason not to forget you.

401
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,460
Richard Branson.

402
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:10,790
Well,

403
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,890
he clearly follows his own advice and
this has led him to a successful and

404
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,830
passionate life.

405
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,720
