1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,320
27 people. They were boys with
their cars. Summer jobs. Oh my God.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,460
Are you one of them?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,960
He dressed up like a clown for them with
his face painted white and red and on

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,820
his best behavior in a
dark room on the bed,

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:16,470
he'd kill them all with the slight of
his hand running far running fast to the

6
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,304
debt.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,130
Those are the lyrics from a song title
John Wayne Gacy Jr by Sufian Stevens.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,400
It is just one of the countless pieces
of art that have been inspired by this

9
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,770
terrifying serial killer,
John Wayne Gacy.

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:37,440
It was a businessman and a
politician to everyone around him.

11
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,070
He was a sweet and charming that no one
in his life could have a guest that he

12
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:44,730
dressed up like pogo the clown and
murdered teenage boys after dark.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,390
The Chicago Police Department found
27 bodies buried in his basement.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,950
They knew that his kill count though it
was at least 33 and there could be more

15
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:55,290
victims that were simply never found.

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,950
This story became front page news and
immediately captivated the nation.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,500
The fact that there's a killer
clown truly existed in the world,

18
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,960
struck fear into the hearts
of people everywhere,

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,680
believing that they could no longer
trust circus performers around their

20
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,250
children.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,660
The story of John Wayne Gacy has inspired
writers to create their own versions

22
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,471
of killer clowns,

23
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,280
including pennywise from Stephen King
as well as twisty the clown in American

24
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:21,480
horror story. And in the upcoming
2019 DC comics film joker,

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,710
Joaquin Phoenix portrays the character
by copying pogo the clown's menacing

26
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,800
makeup.
So who was the man behind the face paints?

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,360
How did he get this way and why did
he go on such a murderous rampage?

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,873
Yeah,

29
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,670
John Wayne Gacy Jr was born in Chicago
on March the 17th 1942 his father,

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,590
John Stanley Gacy was a factory worker.

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,970
John's father was very much a man's man
who enjoyed sports and drinking bear.

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,450
He really wanted a son and he imagined
having a boy to do all over the

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,320
traditional father on activities together
with his mother and was a housewife.

34
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,240
He was very sweet and
loving to our children,

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,830
John and and named their baby John Jr and
gave him the middle name Wayne so that

36
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,340
he could be named after the
manly cowboy actor. John Wayne.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Growing up with the family calls him.

38
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:14,370
Johnny John Senior was a very strict
disciplinarian and are raging alcoholic

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,460
because of his outbursts.

40
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:18,700
It's Johnny spent more time with
his mother and sisters, John Senior.

41
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:22,020
I've tried to play sports with him in
the backyards and go on weekend fishing

42
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,660
trips, but the boy was never
really very interested.

43
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,740
He preferred to plant flowers, cook and
do traditionally feminine activities.

44
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,640
His father was extremely disappointed in
Jonny, so he constant Nicodemus Sissy.

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,330
He asked him if he was trying to be a
girl and forbidden from doing the hobbies

46
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,620
that he actually enjoyed.

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,920
Johnny's mother would spoil him with
food in an attempt to make up for his

48
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,260
father's abuse since he became overweight.

49
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,320
There's parents who are constantly
arguing and it would often escalate into

50
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:47,880
flights.
When his father drank,

51
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:51,450
he would beat Johnny and his sisters
with a leather and raise a strap.

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,060
For many years.
The children would cry out in pain,

53
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,580
but one day during a
particularly bad wedding,

54
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,040
it was like a switch just
flipped and Johnny's brain.

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,860
He stopped crying and
he hardly even flinched.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,340
This only made us father more angry and
he proceeded to beat him even harder.

57
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,821
One day,

58
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,910
Johnny passed out when he was playing
with his friends and he was taken to the

59
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,360
hospital where they diagnosed him with
a heart condition and with that it was

60
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,850
official.
John Wayne Gacy would never be an athlete.

61
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,760
No matter how hard his father
pushed him to play sports,

62
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,510
he could not physically handle running
without his heart. Just giving out.

63
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,200
In 1954 Johnny joined the boy scouts
and he became good friends with a boy

64
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,400
called Barry,
but Shelly,

65
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,280
Johnny felt that he could trust
Barry with his biggest secret.

66
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,070
He stole a pair of panties and
a bra from his mother's bedroom.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,791
When he was alone,

68
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,520
he would dress up as a woman and
stares at himself in the mirror.

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,970
Sometimes he would put on lipstick and
I wonder if he really should have been

70
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,990
born a girl.

71
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,000
There was clear that Johnny was
questioning his gender identity and his

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,843
sexuality.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,250
It must have been obvious to the rest
of his family too because John Senior

74
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:52,060
would often say that he would rather
his son be dead than find out he was a

75
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,060
homosexual. Even though his
father was clearly abusive,

76
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:58,740
Johnny was still desperate to be the son.
His father always wanted these,

77
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:01,480
started to date girls and
tried to have a normal life,

78
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,480
but he was bullied in
school for being overweight.

79
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,870
Since having his heart condition,

80
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,600
it would seem that no matter how
hard he tried to suppress it,

81
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,990
John Wayne Gacy could never fit into
the world that he was born into.

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,260
As soon as he graduated from high school,
John Wayne Gacy was 18 years old sins.

83
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,870
He wants you to get as far away from
his hometown as he possibly could.

84
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,050
He moved to the city of Springfield
where he became a shoe salesman in a

85
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,610
department store.
After work,

86
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:32,730
he became the assistant precinct
captain for the Democratic Party.

87
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,760
He started dating one of his coworkers,
Marion and Meyers.

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,360
Her father was wealthy and well
connected in Springfield politics. Gacy.

89
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:42,420
Told his friends and family that someday
he wants it to become the governor of

90
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:46,980
Illinois and maybe even the presidents
of the United States. A few years later,

91
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:48,500
he married Marilyn Mazda's.

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,650
He was far from a faithful partner on the
day Marilyn was in the hospital giving

93
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,030
birth to their first child.

94
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,240
John Wayne Gacy was at a bar
with one of his male coworkers.

95
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,410
They got drunk and went back to gacys
house and had sex. Just a few hours later,

96
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,760
his first child was born.

97
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,990
John Senior came to see
his new grandchild's and
for the first time in John

98
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,540
Wayne Gacy his life,
his father said that he was proud of him.

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,400
John's new father in law owns several
KFC restaurant franchises or 24 he left

100
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,520
his job selling shoes and became a
manager of one of these restaurants.

101
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,200
According to his best friend,
Barry.

102
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:23,490
Gary at wanted the job very badly because
he wanted to be able to control people.

103
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,820
John Wayne Gacy continued to climb
the ladder with local politics.

104
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,180
He was always studying people around him
and trying to figure out how he could

105
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:31,470
make everyone liked him.

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,070
He built a full service bar in the living
room of his house and he convinced his

107
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:38,270
wife that they needed to throw swingers
parties together. If you're not aware,

108
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,370
this is where couples would show up
and switch spouses for the night.

109
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,540
This was popular back in the 1960 since
everyone was raving about the new free

110
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,380
love movements.

111
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,610
The gay were also known to host massive
orgies and they're hiring these sex

112
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:54,480
parties made John Wayne Gacy
popular almost immediately
until he became the vice

113
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:55,890
presidents of the local council.

114
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,940
They also voted as a man
of the year at the time,

115
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,970
homosexual men usually led double lives.
Whenever they wanted to have gay sags,

116
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,100
they would start cruising.

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,090
Men would take a walk in the park or
down the road late at night waiting for

118
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,290
another man to approach.

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,100
They would have sex scenes often would
never see one another again. However,

120
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,210
since he was a public figure,

121
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,420
it's possible that John Wayne Gacy
thought that it would be too risky to have

122
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,940
sex with any adult who
might know who he is.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,480
He decided to go out to people that
he felt he could easily control.

124
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,530
The invited a 15 year old boy named
Donald Voy. Here's over to his house,

125
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,740
the new Donald, because he worked with
his father who was a local senator.

126
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,710
Donald's looks up to John like
a cool older brother ends.

127
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,830
He offered to let Donald drink
alcohol and cs porn collection.

128
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,240
After the boy he got drunk.

129
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:41,960
He forced Donald to have oral sex with
him when it was over at Gacy threatened

130
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,450
the boy by saying that he
had connections with the mob.

131
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,080
If he ever told anyone he would send
someone to kill him and his family.

132
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,390
When Gacy dropped Donald Hall,
here's off at home,

133
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,310
he gave him $50 in exchange for
the boys. Silence don't. Overall,

134
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,870
he has kept that night to
secret for a very long time,

135
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,520
but he was never at the same again.

136
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,030
In 1968 he broke down and told
his family what had happened.

137
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:05,270
When he was 15 John Wayne
Gacy was arrested for sodomy.

138
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,020
He swore that he did not do it
and asked for a lie detector test.

139
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,000
He was convinced that
he could fool the test,

140
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,910
but he ultimately failed when
he was called out on this line.

141
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,790
He tried to claim that the sex
with Donald was consensual.

142
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
Several of the teenage boys then came
forward to say that there had been raped

143
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:24,170
by an Gacy as well. He was found guilty
and do a sentence to 10 years in prison.

144
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,530
His wife divorced him and she did
not want him to see their children.

145
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,900
Never again. Now, this could
have been the end of it all,

146
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:33,980
but unfortunately Gacy used his charm
to schmooze his way into the hearts of

147
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,530
everyone in the prison.
Once he was behind bars,

148
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,020
he made friends with other
inmates as well as the gods.

149
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,300
Since he had experience working a KFC,

150
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,260
he was able to become the head chef in
the kitchen. He received a lot of praise,

151
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:48,650
but knowing how to properly spice food
and Z was even interviewed for a local

152
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,500
television program called
Christmas at an a Mosa.

153
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,030
Oh,
I've been here now a year and up to weeks.

154
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,780
You know, you pick up right here. Hello.

155
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,810
I hope to be getting out of time and me

156
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,230
all of his father's phase,
no bed come true.

157
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,810
John Xenia died as soon as
this son went to prison.

158
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,990
John Wayne Gacy believed that his father,
he died from shame.

159
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,500
He became so angry that he lashed out
his anger on any gay man he came into

160
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:17,860
contact with. While in prison he
spotted two men having oral sex,

161
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:21,790
so he bashed in one of the men's faces
and said it was bloody just by being

162
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,620
found guilty for raping multiple boys.

163
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:27,280
John Wayne Gacy was released after
just 16 months on good behavior.

164
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,660
He returned to cook county where he lived
with his mum, people in his hometown.

165
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,180
They didn't know about his conviction
and they just remembered him as a young

166
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,940
and innocent boy fat kid
with a heart condition,

167
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,820
so it was very easy for him
to get a fresh start in life.

168
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,970
He found a job as a short order cook
and he saved up his money by working

169
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,410
overtime.
Once he had enough money,

170
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:47,200
he started a construction
company called PDM contractors.

171
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,710
He also jumps back into local politics.
Newly divorced.

172
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,280
Gary started dating a woman that he
knew from high school called Carol Hoff.

173
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,850
She was a cu with two daughters and she
was struggling to make it on well for

174
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,080
that.

175
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,190
John Wayne Gacy was great around kids
and the had a steady job and it was also

176
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,920
ambitious from Carol's perspective.

177
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,110
He was a catch and his daughter
started to call him daddy right away.

178
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
He admitted to Carol that he was bisexual,

179
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,940
but he never told her
about his time in jail.

180
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,360
She accepted him for who he was and
in that moment he had everything,

181
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,430
but he was never satisfied.
In fact,

182
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,090
he felt that had been in prison so long
is craving to have sex with teenage boys

183
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,560
that only been amplified.

184
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,140
One night's John Wayne Gacy was hanging
out at the Greyhound bus station.

185
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
He spotted a 16 year
old's name is Tim Mccoy,

186
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:38,620
who was traveling during Christmas time
and had a brief layover in Chicago.

187
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,800
Gacy started flirting with him and his
offer to show them around the city.

188
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,210
Tim So assumes that this was just a
typical cruising fling. They had sex,

189
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,870
but Casey was angry at himself
for giving into his homosexuality.

190
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,520
He impulsively grabbed a kitchen knife
and stabs him in the chest multiple times.

191
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,090
He buried the boy in the debasement
crawlspace underneath his house.

192
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,490
Tim's parents never saw him for Christmas.
Indeed,

193
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:03,400
it would be years before they found
out about the fate of their son.

194
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,730
John Wayne Gacy got married to Carol
seven months later and she moved into the

195
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,080
house with her daughters.

196
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,560
His new wife would have no idea that
she was moving into a house where the

197
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,710
remains of a young buyer were
buried right below her feet.

198
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,130
John Wayne Gacy continued to
suppress as homosexual urges.

199
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,390
Instead of putting on lipstick,

200
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:22,000
though he started to paint
his face in clown makeup.

201
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,940
Normally clown does have
friendly curved features,

202
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,430
but Gacy painted on sharp harsh edges.

203
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,390
He called himself at pogo the clown and
started showing up at the local hospital

204
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:34,540
to do magic tricks for the children
who were sick when he was pogo.

205
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,000
He got to do all the things
that John was not allowed to do.

206
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,940
This escalated to giving
into as indulgences. Again,

207
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,450
burying his victims in the
basements. John's wife, Carol,

208
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:46,780
was concerned because she could tell
that his personality had drastically

209
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:50,430
changed after he began to play Pogo,
John refused to have sex with her.

210
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,030
He made her feel worthless.

211
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,500
They filed for divorce in 1975 when
he was 33 years old. After that,

212
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,800
he was free to hunt teenage
boys as often as he wanted.

213
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,650
He would drive around town
dressed in his full clown makeup.

214
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,590
If he saw a boy walking alone at night,

215
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,090
he would hold up a gun and
forced them into the car.

216
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,560
He would rape and stab them before
burying them again in the basement.

217
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,900
Burying all of those bodies.
It was hard work.

218
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,650
So he brought in one of his new employees,
David Cram,

219
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,220
to dig holes in the basements.

220
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,950
The claims that he needed to add
a new piping under the house,

221
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:24,520
but he was under strict orders to
avoid certain areas of the basement.

222
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,560
David had no idea that John Wayne Gacy
was forcing him to dig his own grave

223
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,920
crime was from out of town and he
told Gacy that he was looking for new

224
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:33,660
apartments.

225
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,940
Gacy offered to rent in
one of the bedrooms of his
house in exchange for Labor

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,690
one night though pogo the clown walk
through the door and David Cram was

227
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:45,010
confused. John was already drunk and
his makeup was sliding off his face.

228
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,050
He wasn't acting like John Anymore.

229
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,320
He spoke in a nasally high
pitched voice like a clown,

230
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:52,480
and to ask David if he wants it to my tie,

231
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,740
David and assumes that this was some
kind of joke. So he agreed to drinks.

232
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
Pogo asked if he would like to see a magic
trick and he put handcuffs on David's

233
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,240
risks. He dangled the cane. Friends
of him giggling like a child,

234
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,970
pogo the clown men started poking.
David's saying, does this get you mad?

235
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,370
What about this? Huh, Huh.
David then threatened to punch
him if he didn't stop it.

236
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,340
Gacy never broke character
in the middle of a sentence.

237
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:19,330
Pogo started grounding and barking
like a dog. Then he started saying,

238
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:22,750
in a Singsong your voice, I'm
going to rape you. Over and over.

239
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,110
He tried to force David down onto the
floor or attempting to rip off his pants.

240
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,100
David kicked Gacy as hard as he could
and the clown fell to the floor dropping

241
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,160
the key to the handcuffs.
David was able to escape from the house,

242
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:37,690
but he never spoke a word
of this incidence to anyone
until many years later.

243
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,600
Others though it wouldn't
be so lucky to escape.

244
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,163
Yeah.

245
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,270
John Wayne Gacy is loss noon.

246
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:52,740
Victim was a 15 year olds named Robert
piece to work at a desk. Planes Pharmacy.

247
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,630
Gacy had spotted the boy and
a previous shopping trips,

248
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:58,440
so he showed up at the pharmacy
asking to speak to the owner.

249
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,830
He offered to renovate their pharmacy
and casually asked if he knew of any

250
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,700
teenage boys who were looking for a job
because he was willing to pay $5 an hour

251
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,400
for construction work.
Robert Priest took the bait.

252
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,380
This was double what he
made at the pharmacy.

253
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:14,340
You so he called up gacys company to
apply later as he left the house piece

254
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,290
smother. Ask him where
he was going. He said,

255
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,800
some contractor wants to talk
to me about a job and he left.

256
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,500
His mother never saw Hassan again.
At this point,

257
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,690
Gacy had run out of room in his basement.

258
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,520
There were already 27 corpses
beneath his house, so pogo the clown,

259
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:33,190
he have to dump it. Robert
Body in the river. When the
police found Robert Spotty,

260
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,880
it was easy for them to take
testimonies and connect the dots.

261
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,440
They approached John Wayne Gacy,

262
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,480
but he was confident that
he would not be caught.

263
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,960
He even invited the investigators over
to his house for dinner and drinks.

264
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,440
One of the officials could
smell the stench of rotting
corpses coming up through

265
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:49,230
the evidence.
They came back with another Warren sins,

266
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,140
uncovered the bodies of the
teenage boys in the basements.

267
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,360
When John Wayne Gacy was
brought into custody,

268
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:56,430
the police were preparing
to take his mugshots.

269
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,420
They were asking him basic information
like his name and his birthdate,

270
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,230
and officer asked him, where were
you born? Gacy replied out of chaos.

271
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,380
He started to laugh at his own joke.
The camera flash did.

272
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,950
That very moment is capturing the image
of a murderer who was truly pleased with

273
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:14,040
himself when they found the bodies.
Gacy knew that he was done.

274
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,820
He quickly claims that he had multiple
personality disorder and that he had no

275
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:21,980
control over what pogo the clown did,
but clearly he had planned rob piece.

276
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:25,050
It's murder for a long time
after a psychological evaluation.

277
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:28,080
It was obvious to anyone that he
was just trying to plea insanity,

278
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:31,560
but that he seemed to be fully aware
of what he was doing during his trial,

279
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,880
and Casey had the best defense team.

280
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,370
Anyone could ask for it because
of his ties to local governments.

281
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,780
When he received the death penalty,

282
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:40,620
he actually congratulated his team as
this was the result he wanted. All along.

283
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,341
While in prison,

284
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,000
John Wayne Gacy began to draw pictures
of clowns and sold his artwork.

285
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,980
During every interview he did behind bars,

286
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:51,060
Gacy claims that he was
innocent and refuse to take
blame for any of his actions.

287
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,350
I want point even decided to write a
book where he claimed that the bodies in

288
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,670
his basement, we're part of a set up to
ruin his political career. May the 10th,

289
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,900
1994 was the day of his execution.
Crowds of people stood outside the prison,

290
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,020
Sean's and kill him, kill him, uh,

291
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,660
holding up signs when it was announced
that he had died from lethal injection.

292
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,150
The crowds,
Chad immediately following his death,

293
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,600
forensic psychologists dissected
gacys body and removed his brain.

294
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,610
They wanted to see if there
were any abnormalities.

295
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:20,030
There might give them some kind of clue
as to why he had become a serial killer,

296
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,230
but there was nothing to be
found. Even to this day. Experts,

297
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,540
it's still debating on how
to diagnose John Wayne Gacy.

298
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,810
He has been called a sociopath or
psychopath, a paranoid schizophrenia,

299
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,580
some of agreed with his self-diagnosis
of dissociative identity disorder.

300
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,840
What we know for sure though,

301
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,290
is that if it were not for all
the shame he endured or Liz life,

302
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,830
these killings may never have
happened in the first place.

303
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,350
