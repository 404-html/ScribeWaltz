1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,860
In high school,

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,860
the student interested in taking
apart and rebuilding machines,

3
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:07,820
approached the CEO of Hewlett Packard
and asked for some parts to help him

4
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:09,300
complete a class project.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,610
Duly impressed the CEO,

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,730
made arrangements for the student to
get the parts and two years later he was

7
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,250
probably thrilled to be able to
say that he took the time to do so.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,450
Because of that confidence.

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:17,871
Students,

10
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:18,980
you also the parts.

11
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,280
Well,

12
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,510
that was Steve Jobs,

13
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,790
a man who would go on to become the
CEO of apple computers and a preeminent

14
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,390
figure in the tech industry.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,070
Steve jobs was born to two
unmarried graduates in 1955.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,611
Curiously,

17
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:48,370
this is just nine months before
Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,260
His parents gave him up
for adoption and jobs,

19
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,800
was 30 years old in well in the midst of
Tech Start and before he learned about

20
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,140
his birth parents symptoms growing up,

21
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,810
the only family he knew
was his adoptive parents.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,130
A couple of from mountain view,

23
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:04,300
California who fostered his interest in
taking apart and rebuilding machines.

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,710
His father pulled jobs,

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,511
was a machinist.

26
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:10,030
He taught jobs about electronics through
now the age working in the family

27
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:10,480
garage.

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,200
The team spent hours tinkering on
projects during those work sessions,

29
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,130
in the carriage jobs.

30
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,610
His father taught him a lesson that has
made its way into apple's products of

31
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,810
all shapes and sizes.

32
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,360
Don't sacrifice any part of the design,

33
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,340
no matter where it is on the product.

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,971
Jobs later.

35
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:25,990
Describe this saying,

36
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,660
when you're a carpenter making
a beautiful chest of drawers,

37
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,150
you're not going to use a
piece of plywood on the back,

38
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,610
even though faces the wall
and nobody will ever see it.

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,541
You know it's there,

40
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:38,020
so you're going to use a beautiful piece
of wood on the back for you to sleep

41
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:38,710
well at night.

42
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,580
The aesthetic,

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,500
the quality has to be
carried all the way through.

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,490
The job's showed an early
interest in mechanics and design.

45
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:49,900
He did not show early promise in school
his mother had taught him to read as a

46
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,290
toddler,

47
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,920
but he was bored in school and often
goofed off a habit that frustrated one

48
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,930
teacher to the point of
bribing him to behave.

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,130
This teacher saw potential in a young
jobs and jobs later credited Mrs Hill with

50
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:02,890
being one of the saints of his life jobs,

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,320
so excels in that fourth
grade class with Mrs Hill.

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,450
She skipped him over the fifth grade,

53
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:10,180
entirely anti headed straight
for the middle school.

54
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,170
This jump ahead though,

55
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,190
it was pretty tough for him.

56
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:14,800
Initially he was bullied and
he became a bit of a loan out.

57
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,310
Indeed,

58
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,300
he disliked middle school so much that
he told his parents that if he couldn't

59
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,260
switch schools,

60
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,370
he would just stop going to
school altogether in order
to keep jobs in school.

61
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:28,380
The family moved from mountain view to
last Alsace and jobs that settled into

62
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,830
the COUPA Tino school district.

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,881
It was here.

64
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:35,080
The team met and befriended Bill
Fernandez and other students interested in

65
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:36,370
Electronics Fernandez.

66
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:36,581
Well,

67
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,150
he later played a critical role in the
creation of apple computers when he

68
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:41,560
introduced jobs to his neighbor,

69
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,410
another electronics aficionados,

70
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,400
and Bob,

71
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,450
somebody might've heard of
his name was Steve Wozniak.

72
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:47,641
Yeah,

73
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,680
and we've actually got more
on him on surprisingly.

74
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,523
You get a minute?

75
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,520
No,

76
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,250
by the time he entered high school.

77
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:02,461
Well,

78
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:06,810
jobs he was already working at Hewlett
Packard were to cold call to the CEO job

79
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,380
offer,

80
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,550
but while he was in high school,

81
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:09,530
his interests well,

82
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,220
they began to diversify a desk.

83
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,460
Jobs discovered a love for the
classics and Literature in general,

84
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,870
Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare,

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,111
well,

86
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:20,130
his particular favorites during his senior
year jobs was so excelling in English

87
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,260
that he was able to take
classes at Stanford.

88
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,910
When it came time to attend those jobs,

89
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,860
opted to attend state and Oregon,

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,470
but well that didn't
really last very long.

91
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,480
After only one semester jobs.

92
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,560
His previous versions,

93
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,230
he formal education reared
its head and he dropped out.

94
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,540
He continued dropping in on
classes that interested in,

95
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,540
but he wasn't adding any credits
and he wasn't paying for anything.

96
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,410
Interestingly,

97
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,860
one of these classes that he dropped
into when a greatly affected his future,

98
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,430
this is something that he actually
explained in his famous 2005 Stanford

99
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,200
commencement address something by the way,

100
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,760
which is well worth watching.

101
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,820
If I had never dropped in on that
single calligraphy course in college,

102
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,080
the Mac would have never had multiple
type faces or proportionately space fonts.

103
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,460
It's like being a college dropout.

104
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,890
Jobs was able to secure a job
with Atari computers in 1974.

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,070
He works as a tack assisting the engineers
who were doing the heavy duty coding

106
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:17,550
work,

107
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,001
jobs,

108
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:18,920
dead and tablet,

109
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,910
lots of money at the time,

110
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:23,880
and he was trying to scrape funds together
to travel to India to study eastern

111
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:24,360
religion.

112
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,721
Clearly,

113
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,910
here's interesting things
outside of technology,

114
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,740
but it stuck around the of Atari.

115
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,760
Neil bushnell years later said he thought
jobs might've been saving money by

116
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,320
actually living in the office.

117
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm not sure about this,

118
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,470
but I think Steve was
actually living there,

119
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:39,870
so people used to complain
that he didn't smell that well.

120
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,670
I'd come in on the
weekends and it'd be there.

121
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,060
I'd come in late at night and to be
there at the time as it's already also

122
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:48,690
marked a key points in the friendship
between jobs and his old friend.

123
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,890
Steve wasn't the AG jobs,

124
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,930
was assigned to design a
circuit board for the video.

125
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,490
Game breakouts until you approached,

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,910
wasn't act to help because Atari was
offering a bonus if it could be designed

127
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,050
using fewer chips.

128
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,130
Jobs also needed.

129
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,380
The project's completed
as in only four days.

130
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,040
What jobs didn't tell it was New York
was the detory had offered jobs in large

131
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,960
bonus for using fewer chips,

132
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,980
a bonus jobs received and capturing
himself even though wasn't he acted the

133
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,030
majority of the work.

134
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,560
When wasn't he?

135
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,430
I found out about this
like 10 years later.

136
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,810
He's reported to have cried,

137
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,710
but it wasn't a.

138
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,371
He didn't know of.

139
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,770
Jobs is deceased at the time of the teeth.

140
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:21,300
They consider you to experimenting
with technology together,

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,300
but there was a point where they're
tinkering was put on hold because jobs is

142
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:27,420
living in the office and finally
saved enough money to travel to India.

143
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,650
He went to India in search of spiritual
enlightenment is something that was

144
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,810
rather than the fashion in
the sixties and seventies.

145
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,660
He did this trip on an
incredibly tight budgets.

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,890
He slept on the street.

147
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,250
He sweated on crowded buses
and he ate the bad minimum.

148
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,010
He always seems to be
some pretty sketchy food,

149
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,790
reportedly getting dysentery
and losing 40 pounds.

150
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,660
During this time.

151
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,990
He was also meditating and
learning about Zen Buddhism.

152
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,250
He wanted to go to Tibet,

153
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,080
but it's after it's
traveler's checks were stolen.

154
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,090
He decided to head back
home to the united.

155
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,311
When he got back home,

156
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:02,450
he continued meditation as well as another
habit had picked up that would be the

157
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,530
use of psychedelic drugs jobs.

158
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,960
He was a big fan of Lsd,

159
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,330
drug trade in college,

160
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:10,760
and would credit with expanding his
creativity and vision of the world.

161
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,220
Taking lsd was a profound experience.

162
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,350
One of the most important
things in my life.

163
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,520
LSD shows you.

164
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,970
There's another side to the coin and
you can't remember it when it wears off,

165
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,110
but you know it.

166
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,510
It reinforced my sense
of what was important.

167
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,060
Creating great things
instead of making money,

168
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,110
putting things back into the stream of
history and of human consciousness as

169
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,040
much as I could.

170
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,660
Back in the United States jobs had no
money and lived in his parent's tool shed

171
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:47,340
that he had converted into a bedroom.

172
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,600
He wasn't yet continued to work on
computers with jobs convincing Wazniak

173
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,900
there's at least one of the
early products were sellable,

174
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,770
wasn't market built.

175
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,790
A product known as a blue box that could
mimic the tones of a telephone system

176
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,050
and essentially trick iphone into
making a free long distance call with

177
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:04,741
technology today,

178
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,350
we didn't really think twice about
calling someone on the other side of the

179
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:07,830
planet,

180
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,030
but in the 19 seventies,

181
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,110
this was a big deal.

182
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,531
Now,

183
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,341
as you might've guessed,

184
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:11,581
yes,

185
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,740
these blue boxes were totally illegal,

186
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,810
but they did still sell well.

187
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,140
Yeah,

188
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,711
Steve Jobs,

189
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:20,460
his first business was absolutely selling
illegal devices that allowed you to

190
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,410
make long distance phone calls for free.

191
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,681
Now,

192
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,550
the next brain child,

193
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:24,410
that wasn't the cats,

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,720
well,

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,430
it was much more legitimate.

196
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,340
It was a product that
would become the apple one.

197
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,140
In 1976 jobs suggested selling it and
he and wasn't officially started apple

198
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:34,974
computers.

199
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,810
The company was first granted out of jobs,

200
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,860
his parents garage,

201
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,450
and most of their customers,

202
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:40,950
they will hobbyists well enough,

203
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:42,010
computer hobbyists sweat,

204
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,310
laying out money for the apple
one that jobs and Wozniak,

205
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,581
well,

206
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:46,050
they had cash in their pockets.

207
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,880
Jobs began searching for
investors and wasn't he?

208
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,480
He kept designing in 1977,

209
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,790
which was just one year
after the company launched,

210
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,510
they put out a new version of their
computer called the apple two.

211
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,840
This time there's had color graphics and
was much more user friendly allowing it

212
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:03,120
to be used outside of
just the hobbyist market.

213
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,930
They sold $3,000,000 of the apple
two in their first year alone,

214
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,950
but this figure,

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,420
it was about to become dwarfed.

216
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,610
Two years later they had sold $200,

217
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,680
million dollars worth,

218
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,160
but again,

219
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,310
this seemingly huge number
was about to be dwarfed.

220
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:18,930
Yet again in 1988,

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,870
only four years after that
launch jobs in wasn't the act.

222
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,800
They went public.

223
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,110
By the end of Apple's first
day of public trading,

224
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,540
the company was worth an astounding one.

225
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,540
Point $2,000,000,000.

226
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,190
Steve Jobs was only 25 years old

227
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,710
during the nascent years at apple jobs
was dealing with much personal turmoil.

228
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,180
His long time on again off again,

229
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:52,230
girlfriend Sam Brennan had moved in
with him and while she got pregnant,

230
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,500
us was by all accounts not
really thrilled about news,

231
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:55,971
he lays,

232
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:56,804
started Brennan.

233
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,800
I never wanted to ask
that you guys an abortion.

234
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,360
I just didn't want to do that.

235
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,670
Brendan had been offered a job at apple,

236
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,920
but given jobs his
reaction to her pregnancy,

237
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,330
she did not want to take it.

238
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,740
She left him and that house and began
working as a cleaner despite asking for

239
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,610
support from jobs.

240
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,680
He did not provide any support.

241
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,514
Forest Charles,

242
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,030
until a paternity tests confirmed
that he wants the father even then,

243
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,550
despite his company being
worth over a billion dollars,

244
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,210
he was only required to provide
$500 a month in child support.

245
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,620
Just like these are problems,

246
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,480
Lisa and jobs eventually reconciles and
Lisa or even lived with jobs during your

247
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,323
high school years.

248
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,110
She then attended Harvard and today
she works as a writer in New York City,

249
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,800
though it's again,

250
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,461
yes to admit it.

251
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,400
Jobs actually named one of apple's
early products after his daughter,

252
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,530
but at least it can be used it.

253
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:42,360
It wasn't as successful as the
apple two had been this failure.

254
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,590
It was followed by another,

255
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,640
the apple three,

256
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,330
which again failed to live up to
expectations and it's not just the jobs as

257
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,440
expectations,

258
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,490
but everyone's.

259
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,060
Despite apple being jobs,

260
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,660
his company,

261
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,170
the fact that it was public meant that
the apple board had the power to oust him

262
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,070
as CEO.

263
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,520
Well,

264
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,130
we did just actually in 1983,

265
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,240
they didn't really fire him.

266
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,130
They just sent him to Siberia.

267
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,990
Not Literally Siberia of course,

268
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:18,740
but the office he went to was referred
to you with Siberia because it was so out

269
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:20,690
of the way that it was basically exile.

270
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,020
Now,

271
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,070
most apple employees,

272
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,720
they were probably pleased to see him go.

273
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,610
He was notoriously difficult to deal with
and to former apple employee described

274
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:27,921
jobs,

275
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:32,921
his attitude toward work as richmond
spike character assassination in 1985 when

276
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,340
he was tired of hanging out in Siberia
and decided to leave the company that he

277
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,850
had founded and start a brand new one,

278
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,820
or has it been the focus of my entire
adult life was gone and it was devastating

279
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,320
drops out of this experience.

280
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,630
I even thought about running
away from the valley,

281
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,760
but something slowly began to dawn on me.

282
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,480
I still loved what I did and
so I decided to start over.

283
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,560
He started next computer company which
brought its first product to market in

284
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:58,460
1988.

285
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,670
That can be to the price tag of $10,000
a price way higher than most consumers

286
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,354
were willing to pay.

287
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,500
Needless to say,

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,780
it did not sell well.

289
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,160
This wasn't a good style for jobs,

290
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,180
this fledgling company,

291
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,720
and so we decided to shift the
company to building software

292
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,930
with jobs is focused when it was drawn
elsewhere towards something rather

293
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:29,860
unusual fandom.

294
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,910
And that was the movies.

295
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,900
In 1986,

296
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:35,620
he bought Pixar from George Lucas as part
of his dream that his company job has

297
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:39,070
wanted to be responsible for the first
movie done entirely with computer

298
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:39,880
animation.

299
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,260
It took four years,

300
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,690
but eventually you
achieved that dream well,

301
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,290
that movie,

302
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,190
it was toy story.

303
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,750
It was released in November of 1995 and
it became a favorite film for both kids

304
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,584
and adults.

305
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,460
To this day,

306
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,390
it maintains a perfect one
percent score on rotten tomatoes.

307
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,310
A year after the release of Toy story,

308
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,450
it was even better news jobs took pixar
public and didn't something of a Deja Vu

309
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,260
situation.

310
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,860
His shares were worth $1,000,000,000
after the first day of trading,

311
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,090
the first day of trading,

312
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,420
well,

313
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,101
it was the first thing,

314
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,460
the string of good days for jobs.

315
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,140
Shortly after Pixar winds public,

316
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,040
apple put out the welcoming
mat for Steve Jobs to return.

317
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,090
When he returned to apple in 1997,

318
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,090
the company was operating at
a loss and they needed jobs,

319
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,310
his vision and drive back at the helm.

320
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,460
Apple also announced that they were
struggling next computer company turning a

321
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:28,090
previous failure of jobs into a success

322
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,600
jobs he triumphantly return to
the company that he had founded.

323
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,260
The company wanted him to bring apple to
the forefront of the personal computer

324
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:45,980
market.

325
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,900
Within months of his return jobs,

326
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,130
he was named CEO.

327
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,810
He paid himself a salary of one,

328
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,670
$1 a year and didn't exchange,

329
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,000
brought both business acumen and
creative design ideas to the company.

330
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,690
He negotiated a financial deal with
Microsoft that brought apple the cashflow

331
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,560
that it needed to stay afloat while also
helping Microsoft avoid the perception

332
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:04,610
that they were a monopoly.

333
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,060
Then he envisioned the big
idea that helped bring apple
back to profitability in

334
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:08,894
its own right,

335
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,130
and that was the Imac.

336
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,180
It was in 1998 that apple released the
brightly colored eggs shape to desktop

337
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:15,500
computer called the Imac,

338
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:17,330
and the Imac is even still made today,

339
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,440
although it looks rather different
from the Imac forward applicant jobs,

340
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:22,430
they just kind to miss.

341
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,030
They revolutionized the way people
listen to music in 2001 with the Ipod,

342
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,270
and then the way they communicated
in 2007 with the iphone,

343
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,140
and then they were pioneers in the
tablet market with the 2010 release.

344
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:35,060
If the eyepatch job has one set of apple,

345
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,960
we started out to get a computer in
the hands of everyday people and we

346
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:42,500
succeeded beyond our wildest dreams today.

347
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:42,771
Well,

348
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:46,010
it's nearly impossible to walk down the
street without seeing someone with an

349
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:49,490
apple made device in their hands and
through all these years of professional

350
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:50,060
success,

351
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,370
jobs still found the time
to focus on his family.

352
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,630
In 1986,

353
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,320
his adoptive mother was diagnosed with
lung cancer and this the first time

354
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,981
prompted jobs.

355
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:01,610
His interest in his biological parents
when his adoptive mother passed away,

356
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,040
jobs spoke to his father
about contacting his birth.

357
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,480
Parents whose names he had on documents
from his parents' job has minutes,

358
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,540
both his birth mother,

359
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,081
Joanna shy,

360
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:09,410
bold,

361
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,540
that is biological sister Mona Simpson.

362
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,610
Shortly after his adoptive mother died,

363
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,691
Chicagoland and jobs.

364
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,940
His birth father had divorced in 1962.

365
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,080
When the Syrian migrants opted you
return to Syria after earning his phd,

366
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,900
when jobs was introduced to Mona,

367
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,890
she was still searching for their father.

368
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,650
Jobs joined her in the search
and what they found out,

369
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,790
what it was quite surprising.

370
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,480
The father,

371
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,670
while he was not in Syria,

372
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,590
working in academia rather that father
was living in California and is running a

373
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,420
restaurant.

374
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,580
Incredibly jobs said he had met the man,

375
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,410
are identifying as their father had
even shaken his hands and turned in his

376
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,200
restaurants,

377
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,510
but you'd never known
he was his father jobs,

378
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:47,930
though he had no interest in getting to
know his father as it goes into the no

379
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,070
his mother and Mona explaining
his decision by saying
it a little bit about him

380
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,780
and they didn't like what I learned.

381
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,041
Well,

382
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,470
I guess it was his birth family jobs also
decided to start a family of his own.

383
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,670
In 1989 jobs,

384
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,270
gave a lecture at Stanford Business School
and he was riveted by a woman in the

385
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,104
front row.

386
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,710
She was right there in the front row in
the lecture hall and I couldn't take my

387
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:07,520
eyes off her.

388
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,940
I kept losing my train of thought
and started feeling a little giddy.

389
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,350
This is the feeding that jobs described
when he first met Laurene Powell Powell

390
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,460
was an mba students at Stanford and struck
up a conversation with her after the

391
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,150
lecture.

392
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,820
He invited her out to dinner that
night and the two they began.

393
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,390
A romantic relationship is Zen Buddhist
monk presided over the wedding ceremony

394
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,700
at Yosemite National Park in 1991,

395
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,290
and over the next seven years,

396
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,760
the couple had three children.

397
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,270
They remained married until
jobs his death in 2011.

398
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,740
I need to.

399
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,210
All of these successes of the early years
of the 21st century jobs was not free

400
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,470
from worry and well,

401
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:53,700
neither was apple computers.

402
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,130
In 2003 jobs received the news,

403
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:56,964
all of us dread.

404
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,040
She had cancer,

405
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,740
his doctors and found a cancerous
tumor in his pancreas and operable.

406
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,270
It was a rare form of cancer,

407
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:03,961
well jobs.

408
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:07,410
He refused to listen to his doctors
and to have an operation right away.

409
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,070
Instead,

410
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,840
he opted to explore other options,

411
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:14,700
namely veganism and acupuncture in
2004 with these alternative methods not

412
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:15,720
improving his condition.

413
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,270
Job's opted to have the
Cima surgically removed.

414
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,720
Several cancer specialists have since
said that that period of waiting may have

415
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,321
cost jobs,

416
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,750
years of his life in 2005 jobs,

417
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:28,890
gave a commencement address at Stanford
University that frankly and poignantly

418
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,250
discussed his thoughts on life and death
now that you have to confront them at a

419
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:36,330
head on the 15 minute speech reflectors
on three moments in his life that helped

420
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:40,020
him get to where he was in telling those
stories and part of the message the

421
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:41,490
graduates spans of the world.

422
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,630
To do what you love,

423
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,720
remember you are going to die
and to trust your inner voice.

424
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,880
Remembering that I'll be dead soon
is the most important tool I've ever

425
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,460
encountered to help me make
the big choices in life.

426
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,590
Because almost everything,

427
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,990
all external expectations,

428
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,950
all pride,

429
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,840
all fear of embarrassment or failure.

430
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,960
These things just fall
away in the face of death.

431
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,570
Leaving only what is truly important,

432
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,910
remembering that you were going to die
is the best way I know to avoid the trap

433
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,040
of thinking you have something to lose.

434
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,930
You are already naked.

435
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,810
There is no reason not
to follow your heart.

436
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,160
You closed the speech with simple words
from the 19 seventies counter cultural

437
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:22,760
magazine,

438
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,930
the whole Earth Catalog.

439
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,123
Stay hungry,

440
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,330
stay foolish.

441
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,210
He commencement address struck
a cord around the world.

442
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,950
It has been viewed over 27 million times
on Youtube and serves as an inspiration

443
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,650
and a stark reminder of
our limited time on earth.

444
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,210
It was a speech that truly every human
can relate to given by a man whose mind

445
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:44,420
and drive with far more
extraordinary than most humans.

446
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,300
Jobs continue to work it out
or following the surgery,

447
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:00,750
but in 2008 people began asking
questions about his health.

448
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:02,640
His appearance began to show his illness.

449
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,610
He was grading and just
didn't seem healthy.

450
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,260
The company continued to explain this
away off the questions were raised.

451
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,081
One tech events,

452
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:13,320
apple attributed as a parents do a
simple bug and said he was taking

453
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:14,280
antibiotics.

454
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,090
Shareholders,

455
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,190
they continued to worry and in 2009,

456
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,083
the truth came out,

457
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,810
jobs was suffering from ill health and
ended up having a liver transplant.

458
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,530
Tim Cook,

459
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,970
apple is head of worldwide sales,

460
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,030
filled into CEO while jobs was
recovering from the procedure.

461
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,780
Job's later managed to return to his post
and continue to be involved in the day

462
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,940
to day operations of apple
with his prognosis being
described as excellent bus.

463
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,701
Unfortunately,

464
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:39,120
this was not to be only a year and a
half after returning to the helm of apple

465
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,900
jobs had to step down as CEO and providing
his reasons to the company bought.

466
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,560
He stated,

467
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,280
I've always said if there ever came a day
when I could no longer meets my duties

468
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:49,350
and expectations as apple CEO,

469
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,120
I would be the first to let you know.

470
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,010
Unfortunately that day has come though
he stepped down as CEO intended.

471
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,600
Tim Cook the reigns of the company.

472
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,090
Jobs did serve as chairman
of the Apple Board.

473
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,601
Sadly,

474
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:03,870
it was only for six weeks that he
would work for apple in this capacity.

475
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,070
