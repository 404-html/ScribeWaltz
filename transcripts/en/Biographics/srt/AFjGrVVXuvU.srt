1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,081
Very curious,

2
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,390
discoveries in radiation
changed the world.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,470
She became one of the most important
women in science and research is still

4
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,750
important to scientists and doctors today.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,250
She'd be having the first person,

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,270
male or female,

7
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,250
to win the Nobel prize twice.

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,720
And Marie's discovery of the element
radium helps unlock the mysteries of the

9
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,320
asam.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,380
Yet she came from the most
unlikely of circumstances.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,890
Marie Curie showed us that through
hard work and determination,

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,690
anything is possible.

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,900
So in this week's biographics
where you meet Marie Curie,

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,280
scientific pioneer,

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,080
it was like a new world opened up to me,

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,850
the world of science,

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,920
Maria Salamis split.

18
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,930
Oscar was born on November the seventh,

19
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:49,300
18,

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,390
67 in Warsaw opponents.

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,620
She was the fifth child bones or
you've let us love and Brenna slower

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,410
[inaudible] who were both teachers
Vladislav toward high school physics and

23
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,131
mathematics.

24
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,660
And although bronner slower,

25
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,570
I gave birth to five children in
eight years and had tuberculosis.

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,780
She was the full time director
of a private school for girls.

27
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,790
It was only after the birth of Maria
that she finally retired through a series

28
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,810
of bad investments.

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,030
The family had unfortunately
lost their savings,

30
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:18,990
requiring them to board at the private
school where bronner slower had taught.

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,531
This,

32
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:23,010
meant that for the children there was no
privacy and they had to keep quiet and

33
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,590
on their best behavior at all
times as it has mentioned,

34
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,600
bronislaw slower suffered
from tuberculosis.

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,710
She was terrified of passing the lung
disease onto her children so she refused

36
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,260
to hug them or show
any physical affection.

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,250
When Maria,

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,540
who was known as Monia,

39
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,410
was around five,

40
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,190
the family managed to get a place of their
own that they had to take in boarders

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,110
in order to make ends meet manual.

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,460
Didn't have her own bedroom,

43
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,610
but had to sleep on the sofa in the
dining room as part of her chores.

44
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:50,190
She had to get up early in order
to set the table for breakfast.

45
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,430
Menu was fascinated with the
instruments that are father,

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,930
who was a teacher of physics captain.

47
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:55,764
His little study,

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,160
especially the electroscope when
she started school in Eighteen,

49
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,731
74,

50
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,600
age six.

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,210
She was the youngest and
the smallest child there.

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,870
However,

53
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,010
she proved herself to the among the
smartest of the students in her class.

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,930
She has an excellent memory,

55
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,960
so she was often selected to
recite poetry for visitors.

56
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,050
This was something that the intensely
shy girl absolutely detested life in

57
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:18,540
Poland.

58
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,000
It was tough during the latter
half of the 19th century.

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,500
Warsaw was under Russian.

60
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:27,360
Rule law forbids the speaking of Polish
or the learning of any Polish history.

61
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,140
However,

62
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,670
these laws totally backfired,

63
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,870
causing many polls,

64
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,770
including manuals,

65
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:34,770
family to be even more proud
of that Polish heritage.

66
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,060
Manny had dreamed of doing great things
and bringing honor to their country when

67
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,230
Monica was just eight
years old or older sisters.

68
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,870
Sophia caught typhus and died
about two years later and manuals.

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,240
Mother,

70
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,710
she died from tuberculosis.

71
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,960
That is all girl was inconsolable.

72
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,580
The two dearest people in her life,

73
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,150
her sister and her mother had been
cruelly snatched away from her.

74
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,500
Despite her despair manual was able to
maintain top grades at school with the

75
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,700
love and support her father
and remaining siblings.

76
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,640
She began to dream about
an accomplished future.

77
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,720
In 1883,

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,760
she completed a high school education.

79
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,180
She was the first in her class
in every single subjects.

80
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,190
Shortly thereafter though,

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,650
she became ill with what was
called fatigue of growth and study.

82
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,860
She spent a year recovering
with relatives in the country.

83
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,940
On her return,

84
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,950
Anya was intends on furthering
her education in the sciences,

85
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:30,951
but the Russian government's forbid
any Polish wound from attending the

86
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,650
University of Warsaw Year made
a pact with her older sister.

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,120
They would pull their finances so that
first and then Munya could attend the

88
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,950
University of Paris Manya spend
the next six years as governor,

89
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,880
which means that she was this more than
a seven to a wealthy family for three

90
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:45,900
and a half of those years.

91
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,380
She lived with us around risky families,

92
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,630
60 miles from Warsaw.

93
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,260
She tutored the children seven hours a
day and wasn't the Beck and call of the

94
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:55,470
remainder of the family at all
times with the father's approval.

95
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:59,220
She also taught to local peasant children
to read and write and illegal activity

96
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,380
for which she could have
been severely punished.

97
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,620
She used every moment of our
precious free time in order to study.

98
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,551
During this time,

99
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:09,870
manual also began attending
secret meetings of the
floating university members

100
00:04:09,871 --> 00:04:13,020
read about scientific and other works
that were bounded by the Russians because

101
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,570
they thought that they might
stir up rebellious ideas.

102
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,700
After a year of living with this family,

103
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,410
my oldest son,

104
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,760
he was home from university.

105
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,010
He ends Manya now age 19,

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,970
quickly fell in love,

107
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,510
however,

108
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,080
around skis,

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,270
refused to let their son
marry a poor governess.

110
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,450
The unhappy couples separated but money.

111
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,090
I kept working for the family because
Bronwyn was depending on her in order to

112
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:34,980
pay her way to get over the heartbreak,

113
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,720
threw herself into her studies.

114
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,250
She focused on physics
and chemistry in 18,

115
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,670
99 employments with skis and this,

116
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,240
and she moved back to Warsaw where
she began working for another family.

117
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,960
One of her cousins ran Warsaw's
Museum of Industry and agriculture,

118
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,150
which was a lab with punish students,

119
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:52,020
including Manya,

120
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,340
could study science.

121
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,131
By 18,

122
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,560
91.

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,150
Marie had saved enough money for her to
join Bron in Paris and it was here that

124
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,860
she actually changed the name to Maria,

125
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,480
the French fashion off her name,

126
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,430
living with Ron owns a new husband's.

127
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,920
Murray attended these civilian university
before long she tired of the commute,

128
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:14,300
isn't moved into the student area and
living in a tiny attic with no proper

129
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:16,310
lighting and only a coal stove.

130
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,450
She had very little money,

131
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,290
ate poorly,

132
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,740
and sat to pay for our lessons and work
long hours in the university library to

133
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,430
do so.

134
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,180
Yet she founds a work so satisfying
that the hardships were worth.

135
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,290
It's a hot marie,

136
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,680
had to work much harder than
her classmates due to her
limited understanding of

137
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:31,520
the French language.

138
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:31,971
Still,

139
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:35,450
she graduated in 1893 having earned
a master's degree in physics.

140
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,880
She also got to the
top marks in her class.

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
In addition,

142
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,140
she won a scholarship which allowed her
to begin studying for a second degree

143
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,000
this time in mathematics

144
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,710
while studying for mathematics degree,

145
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:50,040
married,

146
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,640
got a job at studying the magnetism
of various types of steel for a French

147
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,020
company to do the work.

148
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,560
However,

149
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,790
she needed to find a lab,

150
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,360
a friend introduced it to a
man who could help it do so.

151
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,130
His name was Pierre Curie.

152
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,370
A teacher ran the head of the lab at
the School of industrial physics and

153
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,450
chemistry in Paris.

154
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,080
He was already famous at this point for
his work with crystals and magnets or

155
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,110
anything on doing our investigations
on the different types of steel.

156
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,560
This continued researching the
effect of electricity on crystals.

157
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,730
No one was more surprised
than carry herself when he
became attracted to Murray.

158
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,030
This man of science considered
most women to be a waste of space.

159
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,960
Yet Marie,

160
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,770
she was different.

161
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,740
She was brilliant and had
a deep love for science.

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,890
Instead of wooing her with flowers
per attempted to steal Marie's hot,

163
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,700
like giving her an autographed
copy of one of his physics papers,

164
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,540
asked Maria to marry him shortly after
they met Marie wanted to say yes,

165
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,940
but felt that if she did marry,

166
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,220
she would never again live
in her beloved Poland.

167
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,230
After completing her mathematics degree,

168
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,120
she returned to Warsaw for a holiday.

169
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,550
I'm sure if she would
have to go back to Paris.

170
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,090
However,

171
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,840
she was bombarded with
love letters from piano.

172
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,350
She finally decided to return in order
to continue her education and to see

173
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,380
Maria went married on July the 26th,

174
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,840
18,

175
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,673
95,

176
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,300
the ever practical Marie or a dark blue
suit that she could later were in the

177
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,470
lab for the next year.

178
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,730
She worked in studying steel
magnetism in August 18,

179
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,301
96.

180
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,620
She gave birth to Irene,

181
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,660
that first child becoming a mother.

182
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,310
Though it didn't slow her down,

183
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,270
she decided to earn a doctorate in
physics and needed a new topic to study.

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,020
She had heard about a French
physicist named Henri background,

185
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,780
Raul and his discovery of
mysterious uranium raise in 1896.

186
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,310
The subjects fascinated turn.

187
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,530
She decided to make it
the focus of a doctorate

188
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,561
in November 18,

189
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:36,190
93.

190
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,750
Wilhelm and a German physicist discovered
it invisible penetrating rays coming

191
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,860
from an electric tube.

192
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,970
In one of his experiments,

193
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,940
he called the Max rates because we
just didn't know what they were.

194
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,000
They had the ability to pass
through flesh and other substances,

195
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,020
but not through hard dense materials
like bones and thick metals.

196
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,710
X Rays and their effects became
world famous within months in 18,

197
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,191
96,

198
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:00,940
the French physicist on Rebif [inaudible]
discovered more kinds of penetrating

199
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:01,510
race,

200
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,343
unlike Rincon,

201
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,240
which were made by an electrical effects.

202
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,590
These reviews that seem to come naturally
for the use of uranium that had left

203
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:12,190
the uranium lying on a sealed packet of
photographic paper for several days in a

204
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:12,611
drawer,

205
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,230
and it caused the paper to miss over.

206
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,520
The uranium seemed to produce some
kind of invisible rays that could pass

207
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,320
through the thick black paper.

208
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,400
Most scientists,

209
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,990
they ignored the uranium raise,

210
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,400
but not Marie Curie.

211
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,680
She threw herself into the study first,

212
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,520
systematically searching for uranium
type of rays coming from other elements,

213
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,410
checking through all 70 elements.

214
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,540
She found that thorium gave off raise.

215
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,650
Next Marie analyzed rocks that contain
more than one elements as she expected.

216
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,970
Most of the uranium type raised given
off by the rocks called pitch blend.

217
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,090
This was because they contain
to uranium or thorium,

218
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,590
but surprise pitch blend gave off
more radiation than she expected,

219
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,150
and the question then came to mind,

220
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:52,311
well,

221
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,700
what was causing this extra radiation?

222
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,160
Also tracking our results
more than 20 times.

223
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,270
Maria announced in July of [inaudible]
98 that she had found a new elements.

224
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,950
She names it Polonia laughter,

225
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,000
her beloved Poland.

226
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,961
At the same time,

227
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:13,310
she invented the word radioactive to
describe a polonium uranium and thorium.

228
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,830
Then in December of 18,

229
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,321
98,

230
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,100
Maria announced the discovery of another
new and even more radioactive elements

231
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,060
radium,

232
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,150
but this was just the beginning because
years of work layer hat Marie and Pierre

233
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,620
had has approved to fellow scientists
that polonium and radium existed,

234
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,573
and to do this,

235
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,670
that to produce the two
elements in their purest forms,

236
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,690
find the weight of the atoms and show
that each element has an atomic weight

237
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,970
different from any other elements,

238
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,440
but their first focus.

239
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,930
It was to produce pure radiant.

240
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,920
To do this,

241
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
they needed a two things,

242
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,210
lots of pitch blends,

243
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,340
and to a large lab.

244
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,360
The pitch blends came from a mine in
Australia and securities were able to buy

245
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:51,320
it out very cheaply.

246
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,720
Finding lab space though that was harder.

247
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,930
The only room available was a
Kohl's leaky shed and the ops work,

248
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,850
but it gave them the
source that they needed.

249
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,780
Maria had some sales pitch Blanton's in
huge parts and stereo with a steel rod

250
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,610
almost as tall as he was.

251
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,600
Despite the hard work,

252
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:09,770
she was determined to discover everything
she could about radioactivity between

253
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:10,790
1,919 Oh,

254
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:14,180
three and Marie published many papers
on her work during this period.

255
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:18,170
She was also completing her doctoral
degree in trying to produce pure radium as

256
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:19,010
if that was not enough.

257
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:19,671
In 1900.

258
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:23,180
She began teaching at a teacher's
college in Sephora represents suburb,

259
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,100
and of course she was raising her
daughter Irene on July the 21st 19.

260
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:28,251
Oh,

261
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:31,510
two Marie finally reported the
weight of one radium assonance.

262
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,330
This was a major breakthrough because
of the weight of the radium atom was

263
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,430
different from the atomic
weight of any other elements.

264
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,270
It proved that Marie had indeed
discovered a new element.

265
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,320
Marie and Pierre could have become rich
by claiming all rights to working with

266
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:45,890
radium.

267
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,311
Instead,

268
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:47,540
they shared their information,

269
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,450
telling people how they purified
the elements and much more.

270
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,080
They believed scientific research
should benefit everybody.

271
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:58,951
In Nineteen,

272
00:10:58,951 --> 00:10:59,051
oh,

273
00:10:59,051 --> 00:10:59,400
three,

274
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,790
Maria became the first woman in Europe
to receive a doctorate in science,

275
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,480
but as the fame of the
Uber Science coupled group,

276
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,500
their physical health
began to deteriorate.

277
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,870
PA was constantly tired and in pain,

278
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:12,480
and Maria was also in a
constant state of exhaustion.

279
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,200
She had recently had a miscarriage
and had lost a lot of weight.

280
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,240
They both also suffered from burns,

281
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,440
numb fingertips.

282
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,610
We now know that they were suffering
from the effects of radiation exposure at

283
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:27,150
the time radium was being touted for its
health benefits because it could kill

284
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:27,984
healthy tissue.

285
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,130
Doctors tested it on disease cells
and found that it also destroyed them.

286
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,641
Soon.

287
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,720
Radium was being used to stop cancer cells
from growing in patients with cancer.

288
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,710
The new treatments,

289
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,350
it was called Curie
therapy in November 19.

290
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:40,451
Oh,

291
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,460
three marine pr.

292
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:45,180
We're given the Humphry Davy metal
England's highest award in chemistry,

293
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,330
but the greatest accolade that
came a month later when they,

294
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,590
along with Henri Becquerel,

295
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,630
won the Nobel Prize for physics.

296
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,670
The Nobel prize came with
a substantial cash award.

297
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,910
This allowed the curious for the
first time to hire a lab assistants.

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,350
Now reporters and visitors,

299
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,780
they wanted to meet the
famous scientific couple.

300
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,500
Some eager report has even attempted
to interview the curious young daughter

301
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,430
Irene Nobel prize winners have to travel
to Sweden to receive their reward and

302
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:10,480
speak about their work,

303
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,310
but Marie was too ill to go.

304
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,010
It wasn't until 1995 that she
was able to make the trip.

305
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,690
The couple's feelings about the prize,

306
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:17,411
though they wouldn't.

307
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,980
Next Marie was proud of our work and
Tara accomplishments of being the first

308
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,110
woman to achieve world
fame as a scientist.

309
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,480
The prize money also helps
to fund their research,

310
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,450
which they had so far been paying
for out of their own pockets,

311
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,930
but they disliked the theme that came
along with the award feeling that it

312
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,370
interfered with our work.

313
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,630
Then in 1984,

314
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,670
Marie gave birth to her
second daughter Eve.

315
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,660
Shortly thereafter,

316
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,170
pro has made a professor at the Sorbonne
and he was given about a laboratory.

317
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:41,501
Ends.

318
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,420
Marie was paid as his chief assistance.

319
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,270
The next year he was elected
to the Academy of Sciences.

320
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,500
For two years.

321
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,060
Things went well for the calories.

322
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,550
They were finally comfortable financially
and were respected leaders in their

323
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:57,140
field.

324
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,340
Then in April of Nineteen,

325
00:12:58,341 --> 00:12:58,431
oh,

326
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,320
six tragedy struck there,

327
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,190
just enjoyed a relaxed weekend in the
country and we're back in rainy Paris.

328
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,890
A rushed off his feet per was
running errands in the rain.

329
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:10,460
When he stepped down to cross the road
and fell in front of a horse drawn wagon,

330
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,080
the sort of horse reared
up and it's he was missed,

331
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,410
but the rear wheels crushed his skull,

332
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,610
killing him instantly.

333
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,160
When word spread that a famous
scientist had been killed,

334
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,220
the crowd had to be stopped from
attacking the innocent driver.

335
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,880
Marie didn't tear about the tragedy
until she returned time that night.

336
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,700
She was simply devastated
by her husband's death.

337
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,390
However,

338
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,190
she remembers what he had once told her.

339
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
Whatever happens,

340
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,780
even if one should become
like a body without a soul,

341
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,970
still one must work,

342
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,400
so when she was offered her
husband's job at the Sorbonne,

343
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:42,860
she accepts it before her
first class reporters,

344
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:46,600
students and curious people crowded the
whole to see the first female teacher at

345
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,390
the institution.

346
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,810
They wondered if she would praise the
husbands or break down under the strain.

347
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,620
Instead,

348
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,000
she began quietly speaking,

349
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,900
picking up at the very spot where peer
had left off during his last lecture.

350
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,220
One of Marie's deepest regrets was the
peer who died without ever having his own

351
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,083
permanent lab.

352
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,560
It gave a great satisfaction in 1989
when plans were put in place to establish

353
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:08,360
the radium adds to use in Paris.

354
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,870
It would have a laboratory that Maria
would supervise and it would be known as

355
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:12,920
the Curie pavilion

356
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,820
working as hard as ever
Merinos did the Lord Calvin,

357
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,080
they Scottish physicists,

358
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,590
had suggested that radium was not an
elements since it had been found to give

359
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,760
off helium gas,

360
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,230
which is itself an elements.

361
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,640
She continued to make even purer
polonium and radium by 1910.

362
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,690
She had produced pure radium and show to
the attic was a brilliant white metal.

363
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,310
She even found its melting point,

364
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,430
which was 700 degrees Celsius in 1910.

365
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Marie also published on 971 page work
treatise on radioactivity and in 1911,

366
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:49,240
Kim and other great honor,

367
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,650
the Nobel Prize for chemistry,

368
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,750
which was awarded to her
alone for making pure radium.

369
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,490
In Nineteen Eleven Radiology,

370
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:59,480
Congress and International Group of
radiation scientists decided they needed a

371
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,170
new unit of measurement for radiation
and they called it the curie.

372
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,950
Maria insisted that she was the only one
who could take on the task of working

373
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,140
out to the exact size of a curie eunice.

374
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,850
It was painstaking work,

375
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,890
but she did it all mps on it.

376
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,791
In 1911,

377
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,520
Marie found to be elected to
the French Academy of Sciences.

378
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,950
Many people said that it was
simply because she was a woman,

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
a scientific work.

380
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,100
It was the highest quality by this point.

381
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,370
Our personal life was being followed
closely by the newspapers and it was great

382
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:27,560
interest in her friendship with physicist,

383
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,120
colleague Paul longer vault,

384
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,810
extremely upset by all this attention
where you fell ill often treatment she

385
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:36,050
stayed with our friends have
gotten in England by 1914.

386
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,760
The radium institute at the University
of Paris was finished the same year that

387
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,030
weld wall one began.

388
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,920
Murray threw herself into the war effort.

389
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,460
She organized extra equipment
for hospitals to help them
locate bullets and trap

390
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,050
null in the wounds of injured soldiers.

391
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,920
She also set up a course to train
people in the use of radiography units.

392
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,970
Other wars ends.

393
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,810
In 1918,

394
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,780
Maria became director of
the Paris radium institutes.

395
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,080
The institutes became a World Center
for radiation physics and chemistry.

396
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,033
In 1920,

397
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,340
murray became friends with Marie
Maloney and American journalist.

398
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,270
Let me helps to improve curious public
image and plan to raise money for the

399
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,790
radium institute by a
lecture tour in the USA.

400
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,770
Although our hearing and
sight we're failing her,

401
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,800
she carried out part of the tour
before her illness for starter,

402
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,760
retired to France.

403
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,590
Many university is awarded
a special degrees and the
women of America gave her a

404
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,990
one gram of radium worth 100,000 dollars.

405
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,250
This was in recognition of our work and
achievements as a female scientist in

406
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,030
1922,

407
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,120
she was last elected to the
French Academy of Medicine.

408
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,400
In the Early Nineteen Twenty 20th,

409
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,430
scientists finally realized
the dangers of radiation.

410
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,760
People working with radioactive
material began taking precautions,

411
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,440
but it was too late for Marie.

412
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
How work with radiation probably caused
the cataract in our eyes that now

413
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,360
threatens out with blindness.

414
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,210
She had to have four operations
to remove the cataracts,

415
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,380
but wanted no one to know.

416
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,930
She didn't want people thinking
she was old and helpless.

417
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,020
Marie continued to oversee the
work in their own labs in Paris.

418
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,620
She also traveled to raise funds
for research by younger scientists.

419
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,670
In 1928,

420
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,770
she had a final operation for a cataract.

421
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,720
She was then cared for
by her daughter Eve.

422
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,830
After further illness,

423
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,270
she died on July the fourth,

424
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:11,691
19,

425
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,160
34 in Switzerland.

426
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,930
She died of a plastic anemia.

427
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,220
The lack of red blood cells caused by
extended exposure to radiation where his

428
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:22,580
legacy lived on in her
daughter Irene in 1935,

429
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:27,110
her husband Frederic received the
Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1995.

430
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,810
Marie and Pierre were reburied
in the Pantheon in Paris.

431
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,200
She is the first woman given that
honor based on her own achievements.

432
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,810
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

433
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,651
