Brought war with Japan Bidding Yamamoto
against the best military minds of the

11
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,400
US armed forces.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,533
In the end though,

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,100
it took a clandestine mid and fascination
to bring them to heel and this week's

15
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,550
We examined the life of
a sea rocket Yamamoto.

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,091
Yeah.

17
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:53,360
Well No.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,750
Tony was born as the
Roku on April the fourth,

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,171
18,

20
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:01,280
84 in the town of Naga Erica
on the island of Honshu.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,880
His father tack our new study.

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,980
Yoshi had been involved in an unsuccessful
Samurai lead rebellion against the

23
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:09,740
imperial governments back in 1877.

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,980
The government subsequent crackdown on
the Samurai made it difficult for to Kano

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,110
to find work and he was forced to move
all over 100 trying to secure a job.

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:18,450
I've.

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,340
You're returning to Naga.

28
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:19,671
Okay.

29
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:23,990
His wife died and soon after he married
his younger sister in law together,

30
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,160
they had three children.

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,440
The youngest of these was this rocky.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,210
The name means 56,

33
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:32,110
which was his father's age
when he was born to Kona.

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,710
It was an educated man who,

35
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:36,080
when he could find a position
worked as a school teacher.

36
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,900
He passed his appreciation for
knowledge onto his children.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,570
The most gifted of who you see,

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,120
rocky.

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,870
The boys saw education as the route
to breaking the cycle of poverty.

40
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,000
That was his lot in life

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,021
in 19.

42
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,171
Oh,

43
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:58,540
one is Iraq is diligence and application
to his studies paid off when he wanted

44
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,710
an appointment to the
imperial Navy Academy.

45
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,350
In fact,

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,810
his application test score was the second
highest in the entire country for the

47
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:06,621
next three years,

48
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,660
between the ages of 16 and 19,

49
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,890
he lived at the Naval Academy.

50
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:11,790
You had to at a dream
a city near Hiroshima.

51
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,250
In the southern part of Japan,

52
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,290
life of the academy was spotting.

53
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,580
Discipline is a rocky,

54
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:17,930
were acquitted himself competently,

55
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,450
but it was during the fourth
year of the cadetship,

56
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,440
which we spent at sea that he read it
again to shine is enabled as quickly

57
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:28,520
recognized leadership qualities in the
man just by only standing at five foot

58
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,800
three inches and weighing
around 120 pounds.

59
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:35,210
He was physically skills being adapted
to both gymnastics and the martial arts.

60
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,050
Kendo,

61
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,310
unlike most other students,

62
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:40,160
he was not interested in
drinking and socializing,

63
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,760
but would rather spend his time at reading
the Bible and getting a head on his

64
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:44,594
studies.

65
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,450
In November of 1994 this year,

66
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,440
rocky graduated from the Naval Academy.

67
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,440
Seventh out of 200 since
February of that year,

68
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,190
Japan had been at war with Russia,

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,600
runs.

70
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,990
See Rocky was immediately
thrown right into the fray.

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,800
It was assigned to the warship
Nisshin on the night of May,

72
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,521
the 26th,

73
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:00,881
19.

74
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,001
Oh,

75
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,510
five.

76
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,830
The climactic battle of the war began
with the Russian Baltic fleet attacking

77
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,620
the Japanese fleet and
the Tricia Shima straight.

78
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,890
The mission was one of eight imperial
ships presence out of 89 social ships with

79
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,430
more modern ships,

80
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,031
greater speeds,

81
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,500
and better trained crews that Japanese
emerged victorious with 21 Russian ships

82
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,690
being sunk and seven being captured.

83
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,620
It was the victory that the Japanese
had been desperately needing and it

84
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,540
propelled them to final victory.

85
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,101
However,

86
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:35,851
versie rocky,

87
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:36,990
the price for the jury,

88
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,883
it was DB,

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,850
one of the gun barrels on board his
ship and burst with the shrapnel flying

90
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,030
everywhere he calls up launch
piece of metal in the thigh,

91
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:48,900
and dozens of smaller fragments peppered
all throughout his lower body in

92
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,960
addition to have his fingers
well hanging by a threat,

93
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,980
he was evacuated to a hospital and did
not return to duty until August the

94
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:56,460
fifth.

95
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,940
Still,

96
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,960
he was recognized for his bravery in
this fast test undefined with a letter of

97
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:05,520
citation and personal commendation
from Admiral [inaudible] Togo.

98
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,770
After recovering from his injuries,

99
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,161
this Iraq,

100
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,770
he served on three ships on one of them.

101
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,230
He traveled to the west
coast of the United States,

102
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:16,140
giving him his first
American interaction in 19.

103
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:16,241
Oh,

104
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:20,070
eight agency rocky completed the basic
course at the naval gunnery school going

105
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:23,220
on to graduate from the
advanced course in 1911.

106
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,120
He then spent time on a battleship before
attending the Naval Staff College in

107
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,890
Nineteen Thirteen and see rocky excelled
in staff training being Mr x by his

108
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:33,660
Tutus as a man on the rise.

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,590
Following his graduation in 1916,

110
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,270
he was appointed to the second battle
squadron as a leftenant commander.

111
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,860
It was around this time
that Tacoma is Iraq,

112
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,110
became Yamamoto is rocky with both his
parents having died in 1912 and having

113
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,321
older brothers,

114
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:58,440
it was clear that this Iraqi would
never come to head the Chicano plan.

115
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,761
Yeah,

116
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:01,730
so the Yamamoto cannon was
in need of a new mail APP.

117
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,330
The clams saw the rising young
naval officer as the perfect fit.

118
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,283
This is what I'm saying,

119
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,860
a man into a family in
order to serve as the male.

120
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:12,050
There was quite a common practice
and it was accepted by us,

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,860
the rocky,

122
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,510
however it required that he find a wife
and two sons do continue the Yamamoto

123
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:18,140
name.

124
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,480
It was at the age of 34.

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,350
Then in 1918,

126
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,560
the TC Roku entered into an arranged
marriage the few months later in 1919,

127
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,340
he was assigned to the United States
do take up an assignment as a naval

128
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,174
representative.

129
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,840
He spends a month at Harvard University
studying the English language event,

130
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,220
continued to study independently to
master English while also learning all he

131
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:38,570
could about the oil industry,

132
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,460
which was vital to the operation of an
efficient navy while in the USC also

133
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,690
picks up a penchant for gambling which
he proved to be quite successful.

134
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,150
In fact,

135
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,430
he took a tour of Mexican oil fields which
was partly financed from his gambling

136
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:57,110
proceeds in 1921 and see rocky returned
to Japan where he received a posting,

137
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,870
an instructor at the Naval Staff College.

138
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,600
Over the five years of his service.

139
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,421
In this capacity,

140
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:06,680
he deepened his knowledge of oil while
also developing a fascination with

141
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,514
aviation.

142
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,570
In 1926,

143
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:13,190
he was assigned to the United States for
a second time where he stayed for two

144
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:18,140
years as he rocky's two great passions
combined in 1928 when he was given

145
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:22,320
command of the Imperial Navy's
first aircraft carrier ecology.

146
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,130
He retains this post for
a little over a year.

147
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,881
Within that time,

148
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:29,010
he developed a strong bonds with
the men under his command z grit.

149
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,860
The tomorrow they're strict,

150
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
but Faq Monda.

151
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:38,871
Let's see.

152
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,650
Rocky was mastery of the English language,

153
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,350
made him a valuable asset to
the Japanese high command,

154
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,150
and in October of 1929,

155
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:49,590
he was stationed to London to act as an
assistant to the Japanese delegation to

156
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:52,110
the London Naval
Conference of Nineteen 30.

157
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,430
During his time in London,

158
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:57,450
he received the news that he had been
promoted to rear admiral back in Japan.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,140
Yamamoto was given yet another
role within the imperial navy.

160
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,100
He became head of the technical
division of the aeronautics department.

161
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,001
After three years,

162
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,490
he then found himself back
in command to the economy.

163
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,350
He threw himself into this role,

164
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:13,680
disciplining and training as
aviators with absolute precision.

165
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,370
However,

166
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,450
eight months into this role,

167
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:18,000
he was again selected
for service overseas.

168
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,620
The preliminary discussions for the second
London naval conference took place in

169
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:27,621
London in October of 1934 and the gamma
motor was selected as a chief delegate.

170
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,790
He was tasked with pressing Japan's claim
for a better naval construction ratio,

171
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,560
which had previously been set at 60
percent of the battleship and carrier

172
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,370
strength of the United States and Britain.

173
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,380
Despite his own personal misgivings,

174
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:42,570
he proved to be the right man for the job.

175
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,110
His opposition negotiators from Britain
and the US were impressed with his

176
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,090
intelligence and his reasonableness.

177
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,350
He put the demands from his government
on the table which worth and naval parity

178
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,940
with the other two powers.

179
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,690
This was never going to be acceptable
to the Brits and the Americans and

180
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,593
Yamamoto.

181
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,490
He knew this,

182
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,360
the negotiations.

183
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:04,440
They went nowhere and the conference
broke up without resolution even though we

184
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,930
had not been able to achieve
as government's ambitions.

185
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:10,830
Yamamotos prominence at the conference
had made in internationally famous.

186
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,270
When he returned to Japan,

187
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,720
he faced a period of stagnation
which was very troubling to him.

188
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,380
In fact,

189
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,570
he seriously considered at this point,

190
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,100
resigning from the navy.

191
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,090
Fun Kit was resolved though in December
of 1935 when he was appointed chief of

192
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,370
the aeronautics department
at the Navy Ministry.

193
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,030
He was now the boss of everything
to do with naval aviation in Japan.

194
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,870
This gave him the ability to put into
development some of the concepts that he

195
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:41,980
had previously worked on.

196
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,160
These included the type 96
land based attack plane.

197
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,140
This one's the most advanced attack plane
possessed by any navy in the world and

198
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:55,141
would form a central part of Yamamotos
offensive plans against the United

199
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,530
States.

200
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:55,831
Now,

201
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:57,120
on February the 26th,

202
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:57,690
19,

203
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,321
36,

204
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,720
there was an attempted
military coup in Japan.

205
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,230
The nationalistic governments
placed Admiral Magonia Sama.

206
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,430
Whereas the new minister of the Navy
Yamamoto excepted the position of vice

207
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:08,761
navy,

208
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,510
Minnesota.

209
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,010
He sat about reinstilling,

210
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:15,000
a lost discipline and the navy's command
dismissing those who didn't meet the

211
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:15,780
standards.

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,650
He also actively worked to prevent
the army's push towards war.

213
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,760
Nineteen 37 was to prove to be a key,

214
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:30,010
uh,

215
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,410
in the advancement of Japan's war stance
in the wake of starting a war on her

216
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,490
doorstep with China.

217
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,420
She signed a tripartite pact with
Germany and definitely yellow.

218
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,590
Jay was against the pact and he
wasn't shy about voicing his opinion.

219
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,490
This brought him into increasing
conflicts with the army administration and

220
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,690
their right wing followers.

221
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,030
He received numerous death threats.

222
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,380
These didn't phase him and he appears
to have accepted that sooner or later he

223
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:56,970
would simply be assassinated.

224
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,670
A crisis occurred in 1939.

225
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:03,240
This was when the Germans signs
a nonaggression pact with Russia,

226
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,640
the traditional enemies of the Japanese.

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,810
On August the 23rd,

228
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,150
the entire Japanese cabinet resigned,

229
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,710
resulting in Yamamotos loss
of his position as vice
navy minister along with his

230
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:17,160
Superior Navy Minister
Uni before leaving office.

231
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:17,551
However,

232
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:21,660
you know I had appointed Yamamoto as
the commander in chief of the combined

233
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,860
imperial fleet.

234
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,540
Yamamoto was a highly
experienced commander and to
get the respect of his men,

235
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,700
he was seen as a pacifist at a time when
the country was marching towards war.

236
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,420
However,

237
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,510
he threw himself into the
position with his usual Gusto,

238
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,400
pushing aside his own reservations and
stepping up training and preparation for

239
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,330
the coming conflict.

240
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,740
By the end of 1940,

241
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:48,060
the pro German factions within the armed
forces were driving the country towards

242
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,130
a conflict with the United States,

243
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,280
though personally opposed
to taking on the use.

244
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:56,310
I'm the moto began planning
for succession eventuality.

245
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,990
He was adamant that the only chance for
success against America laying with a

246
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,410
massive surprise attack that
would take out the American fleet,

247
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,550
followed up by the blitzkrieg like tactics
that the Germans were using with such

248
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,870
positive effects in Europe.

249
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,040
It repeatedly stated that if a wall was
to be one against the United States,

250
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,590
it had to be completed within six months.

251
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,191
Otherwise,

252
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:21,990
the economic and manpower advantage of
the Americans would inevitably prevailed.

253
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,130
In July 19,

254
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:23,701
41,

255
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:28,560
the United States responded to continue
Japanese aggression in China by imposing

256
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:33,360
a trade embargo on Japan and freezing
all Japanese assets in its country,

257
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,830
Britain and the Netherlands.

258
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,270
They quickly followed suit.

259
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,420
The most crippling effect
was the loss of oil imports,

260
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:44,421
which accounted for 90 percent of Japan's
usage and of course the largest user

261
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,760
of oil and the country
was Japan's imperial navy.

262
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,570
The Japanese response was to further
step up preparation for war while also

263
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:55,240
looking to seize control of the oil
reserves held in the Dutch east indies and

264
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,590
the British had in the Far East.

265
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,060
Yamamoto believed that any attack on
or British possessions withdraw the

266
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,100
Americans into an armed conflict.

267
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,580
It was at this time that
Yamamoto formulated the plan
for a decisive preemptive

268
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:17,270
strike on the American naval
base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

269
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,410
He believed that such a crushing blow
would destroy American morale and lead to

270
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:22,970
a negotiated peace settlement.

271
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,360
The plan was risky and many
officials were opposed to it.

272
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,410
It's big volumes about Yamamoto is
prestige and influence that he was able to

273
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:32,840
push the plan through to a final approval.

274
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,460
The plan was actually rejected by
the navy general staff several times,

275
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:38,720
but finally I'm a moto.

276
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,320
Had to put his foot down as long
as he was commander in chief.

277
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,960
He called his command is
the Pearl Harbor attack.

278
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,913
We'd go ahead.

279
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,360
He then went to the naval general staff
and told them that unless the plan was

280
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:50,990
approved,

281
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,870
he and his entire staff would resign.

282
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,170
The idea of going to war with out Yamamoto
was a scary prospect to the navy bras

283
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,800
and they finally relented.

284
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,720
Yamamoto is planned for Pearl Harbor,

285
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,690
was to sink as many
battleships as possible.

286
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,460
He sold the battleship as the symbol of
American naval superiority and figured

287
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:14,540
that the sudden loss of the majority of
that reserve would destroy the American

288
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,374
fighting spirit.

289
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,951
However,

290
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:18,380
staff officer for the first athletes,

291
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,480
[inaudible] Granada,

292
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:24,481
I felt that it was more advantageous do
concentrate on singing American aircraft

293
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:25,310
carriers.

294
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,940
In the end,

295
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,170
a compromise was reached.

296
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,280
The first wave of the attack comprising
of 40 torpedo planes would be directed

297
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,810
at two carriers.

298
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,790
The other 24 planes would
focus on the eight battleships.

299
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,520
That could also potentially be that
another 50 level Bowman's web to head for

300
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,280
battleship row where most of that
or ships were expected to be buffed.

301
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:43,971
Meanwhile,

302
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:47,820
54 dive bombers were the
escorting fighters were to
attack the oil fields on a

303
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:52,040
Awahoo who the second wave of the attack
was to comprise 81 dive bombers and was

304
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,790
intended to finish off the cruisers with
their bombs being too small to damage

305
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,630
the battleships.

306
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,510
As it turned down to the attack
during the early hours of December,

307
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:00,021
the seventh,

308
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:00,441
19,

309
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:04,250
41 was far more successful and
it's targeting of battleships,

310
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,120
cruises,

311
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,190
none of which were actually
in the doc that day.

312
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,330
The battleships so in West Virginia was
sunk while the California was struck

313
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:15,230
with two torpedoes eventually sinking
and the Nevada with a single strike that

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,430
also brought her down.

315
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,630
All of this was achieved in only
11 minutes in battleship row.

316
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:24,640
The Arizona was struck with a
1,760 pounds armor piercing,

317
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,540
bombed the forward magazine of the ship,

318
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,200
exploded,

319
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,280
killing 1000,

320
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,690
177 offices and creaming the
attack was a complete success.

321
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:37,400
Achieving Yamamotos objective
of decimating American
naval power in one fell

322
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,060
sweep.

323
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,680
18 ships had been sunk or damaged while
only 29 Japanese aircraft had been shot

324
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,100
down.

325
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Most pleasing dmr motor was that five
battleships that either sunk or beached in

326
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:49,220
the bigger picture of things.

327
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:49,521
However,

328
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,570
the attack at Pearl Harbor it achieved
little yamamoto is emphasis on destroying

329
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,201
battleships.

330
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,030
It was not a sound policy.

331
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,900
The Americans were already moving towards
carriers rather than battleships and

332
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,090
the Pearl Harbor attack merely sped up.

333
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,300
This transition further more than
rather than breaking American morale is

334
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:09,500
Yamamoto had thought that the attack
served as a rallying cry to drive the

335
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,200
American zone.

336
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,150
Two final victory

337
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,130
with the United States Declaration of
war against Japan on December the eighth,

338
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:21,521
19,

339
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,330
41.

340
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,470
The Japanese had to devise a strategy
to overcome this far greater power.

341
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,520
It was decided to fight a
defensive campaign where
the Americans would be drawn

342
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:31,780
into the Pacific eastern,

343
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,270
worn down to the point of accepting
a negotiated peace settlement.

344
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,831
Meanwhile,

345
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:39,760
the Japanese would occupy key territories
in the Asia Pacific moving down into

346
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:41,860
Australasia or in the central Pacific,

347
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,380
Yemen military believe that
when Singapore was taken,

348
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,050
the time would be right to sue for peace
with the success of his brainchild,

349
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,150
the Pearl Harbor Attack
Yamamotos influence group.

350
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,930
He was instrumental in planning invasions
on Malaysia and the Philippines as

351
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,340
well as Guam in Singapore.

352
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,380
In early February of 1942,

353
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:04,090
he moved his staff headquarters onto the
super battleship yamato with Singapore

354
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:04,841
having fallen.

355
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:08,410
Yamamoto believed that it was time for
his government to pressure the allies for

356
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:08,890
peace.

357
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,700
It's lack of action on this greatly
frustrated him despite his conviction that

358
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:16,180
our campaign that went for more
than six months would be disastrous.

359
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:18,670
He was forced to plan out
the next phase of the war.

360
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,211
However,

361
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:23,440
his ideas were at odds with the naval
general staff who wanted to concentrate on

362
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,670
Australia where he was intent on taking
control of the Indian subcontinent.

363
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,450
The army,

364
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,900
however,

365
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,230
refused to back such a plan and it
was quickly taken off the table.

366
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,440
The first major setback for the Japanese,

367
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:43,860
the code with the battle of coral sea
between may the fourth and the eighth,

368
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:44,760
1942,

369
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,180
which successfully hold to the
Japanese invasion of New Guinea.

370
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,780
Yeah,

371
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:48,991
million.

372
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:52,800
So we continue to butt heads with the
naval general stuff as he now proposed an

373
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:57,270
attack on Midway atoll that would draw
out the remnants of the American fleet

374
00:16:57,271 --> 00:16:58,104
from Hawaii.

375
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,880
Wires could be utterly destroyed.

376
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,140
Resistance was stiff with general staff
members pointing out the midway was too

377
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:07,320
close to Pearl Harbor and
too far away from Japan.

378
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,370
You have a motorcycle now used his old
tactic of threatening to resign and you

379
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:12,510
go his way again.

380
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,790
The attack on midway required Yamamoto,

381
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,780
two coordinators,

382
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:18,000
fleets over huge stretches of water.

383
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,211
Yeah,

384
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:18,781
Moto,

385
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:19,231
but board.

386
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:22,260
The Yamato personally led
one battle group and self.

387
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,310
What he didn't know was that the Americans
had broken their secret codes and

388
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,580
we're already aware of the
attack and advance through us.

389
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,910
Carriers were sent to midway in
order to surprise the Japanese.

390
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,050
In the ensuing battle,

391
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:37,590
four Japanese carriers were sent to
the bottom of the ocean acknowledging

392
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,070
defeat.

393
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,700
Yamamoto ordered his remaining ships
back to base the defeat at midway,

394
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,350
was a humiliation for Yamamoto and see
received much criticism for us still,

395
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,530
he was able to retain his
position as commander chief,

396
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:53,730
largely because to remove in would have
been too demoralizing for the men under

397
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:54,564
his command.

398
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,740
Over the next few months,

399
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,670
the Japanese achieved limited success
against the fleet around Guata canal in

400
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,630
the Solomon Islands.

401
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,010
The Battle of Guadalcanal,

402
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:02,431
however,

403
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,250
was another crushing
defeat for the Japanese

404
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,060
in the wake of Guadalcanal.

405
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:17,920
Yamamoto set out on a morale boosting
tour of af four spaces across the South

406
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,980
Pacific on April the 14th,

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
1943 and message which announced his
exact itinerary on route to a base in the

408
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,560
Solomon Islands was
intercepted by US intelligence.

409
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,230
This presented the Americans
with the perfect opportunity,

410
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,560
do assassinate the Japanese
naval commander in chief.

411
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,430
It was a risk and that it would portray
the Americans' ability to break Japanese

412
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:36,761
code,

413
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:40,720
but Yamamoto was seen as such a big
fish that it was deemed worth giving up.

414
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:41,680
This intelligence,

415
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,311
a plan,

416
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:43,300
nicknames operation.

417
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:47,260
Vengeance was put into operation with
the objective of killing Yamamoto.

418
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,820
18 US fighter pilots were chosen from
the base at Guadalcanal to participate in

419
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:52,570
the operation.

420
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,430
14 of them would provide cover at around
20,000 feet while for others for them

421
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:00,460
to a strikeforce to blow yamamotos
plane right out of the sky.

422
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,620
The attack it was set for April the 18th
that morning that was not one but two

423
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,040
m,

424
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,970
one type one betty bombers
along with six a six,

425
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,220
seven,

426
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,250
zero five just to provide
escort and yamamotos fleet.

427
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,090
It wasn't long into the flight when
the four American p 38 swept seen

428
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:19,960
approaching the bomber that was carrying
Emma Moto immediately began to descend

429
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:22,090
while the escort planes
moved into intercept,

430
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:25,690
the Americans bombed so they weren't
able to prevent the [inaudible] from

431
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,980
achieving their objectives.

432
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,290
With both of the betty
bombers receiving strikes,

433
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,700
both of the planes crashed.

434
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,241
However,

435
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:34,840
an autopsy on his body revealed that
Yamamoto who was sitting on the starboard

436
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,230
side of the plane behind
the plane commander had been
struck by bullets to the

437
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:41,920
drawer and shoulder and was probably
dead before the plane hit the grounds.

438
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,620
Yamamotos body was found later that day.

439
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,120
It had been thrown from the wreckage,

440
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,380
still strapped to the seat.

441
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,520
The death of Yamamoto was not revealed
to the Japanese people until may the 20,

442
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:54,130
fast more than a month
after he was shot down,

443
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,960
more than a million people lined the
streets of Tokyo as his ashes passed by.

444
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,690
So today's video was
made possible by audible,

445
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,360
who I'm sure many of
you know about already.

446
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,590
I've been a longtime customer of audible
reading tons of books on all sorts of

447
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:09,250
subjects.

448
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,551
In fact,

449
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:10,510
it's kind of a funny story.

450
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:14,410
I personally really love autobiographies
and biographies and listening to those

451
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:15,244
three audible.

452
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,950
I was actually inspired
me to stop this channel.

453
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,611
No kidding.

454
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,290
It all kind of came full circle,

455
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,460
so thanks for that order bulk.

456
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,210
There are loads of autobiographies on
audible and I bet that if it's a notable

457
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:25,421
book,

458
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:27,880
there's going to be a cool
audiobook version of it as well.

459
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,170
Also related to this video,

460
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,150
there are tons of audio
books on World War Two,

461
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:32,170
the Pacific theater,

462
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:33,370
Pearl Harbor itself.

463
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,720
Lots and lots of those.

464
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:37,870
I just did a quick search and the entire
first page of results are all super

465
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,810
highly rated books about this
attack and its consequences.

466
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,111
Now,

467
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:44,170
what about was always a good deal and
you'd go into an audio book a month for a

468
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,100
low fee,

469
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:46,210
but now there's even more.

470
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:50,470
In addition them is get
to audible originals every
