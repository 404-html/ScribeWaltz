1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,380
He was the child from hell,

2
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:05,220
born into royalty with a deformity that
put a lifelong chip on his shoulder.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,560
But by the time he
became ruler of Germany,

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:12,030
this grandson of Queen Victoria had
grown to hate the British hate the French

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,560
and well paid just about every other
European power. Over the next 20 years,

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:20,070
he orchestrated the tension that exploded
into the nightmare that was world war

7
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:25,071
one and in this week's biographics we
uncover the mixed onto life of Kaiser

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,303
Wilhelm.
The seconds

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,300
the Charles who wants to
become Kaysville home.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,540
The second was born Friedrich Advil home,
Victor Albert von, the Hohenzollern.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,630
The date was January the 27th 1859 and
the place was Pottstown and what was then

12
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,540
the state of Prussia. His father was
Prince Frederick Ville, helm of pressure,

13
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,450
while his mother was the
English Princess Victoria.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,800
The birth was not an easy one with the
doctor having great difficulty getting

15
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:03,470
the baby out of the birth
canal as a result of ill homes,

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,910
left arm was virtually useless, being
significantly shorter than his other arm.

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,150
Many historians believe that
Ville hymns deformity get stunted.

18
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:15,110
His emotional growth and contributed
to as reckless behavior in later life.

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,850
What is certain is that he was extremely
self conscious about his empowered on

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,770
and constantly sought ways to hide.

21
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:25,010
The deformity of Wilhelm was second
in line to be the king of Prussia.

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,400
He was also the first grandson
born to England's Queen Victoria.

23
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,170
Victoria was fond of the child considering
to be a well mannered young step from

24
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:37,100
the start and whether he demonstrated a
volatile disposition at the age of four

25
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:39,560
he was taken to England to
attend to royal wedding.

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,460
Parts of his tiny uniforming created
a small dagger. During the ceremony,

27
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,840
Wilhelm began fidgeting.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
His uncle's standing alongside
nudged him and told him to be still,

29
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,130
but the fiery four year old
he was having none of it.

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,470
He pulled out the dagger and
to threaten to stab his uncle.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,330
Then when the uncle attempted
to restrain him Ville, I'm busy.

32
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:01,280
Then the leg grandmother,
Victoria would not have been amused,

33
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:04,840
but fortunately she never found out about
the incidence. Villareal was another.

34
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,800
It was constantly worrying about her son.

35
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,920
In addition to having to
contend with is angry manner.

36
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,500
She felt guilty about his arm deformity,

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,930
irrationally blaming
herself for the condition.

38
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,160
She worried that it would prevent him
from fulfilling his obligations as add to

39
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:19,790
the throne.

40
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,630
One thing she was determined not to let
the arm deformity do was stop her son

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,460
from riding a horse.
As a result,

42
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:29,450
she ensured that he began taking horse
riding lessons at the age of eight the

43
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,970
lessons were hell for the future ruler.

44
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,930
He constantly fell from the horse largely
due to the lack of balance calls to

45
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,320
buy his deformed arm.
Yes.

46
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,270
After weeks of persevering often
with tears rolling down his cheeks,

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,110
he managed to overcome his limitations
becoming a capable horsemen.

48
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,410
In 1871 the German and
officially came into being.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,390
It was to be ruled by the king of Prussia.

50
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,980
12 year old veil home was now second in
line to become the head of two nations

51
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,180
and his preteen years.

52
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,500
Phil home had been privately
tutored from the age of 13 however,

53
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,110
he was sent to the Friedrichs,
gymnasium and castle.

54
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,890
He proved to be a talented students
performing well in all of his studies.

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,640
He graduated at the age
of 18 and 1877 grand.

56
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:13,810
Mother Victoria was sent delighted with
our special boy that she awarded him the

57
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:17,590
order of the Garter, one of the highest
that she could have bestowed upon him.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,820
After graduating, he attended
the University of Bonn
for the next four years.

59
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,210
He studied law and politics.
In addition to his formal studies,

60
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:29,560
Ville helm was inculcated into the
military ideals of Prussian manliness.

61
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,970
This concept of the tough disciplines
military men was closely aligned with that

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,260
oppression.
Nationalism,

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,880
although his mother tried hard to impress
the Victorian ideals of liberalism

64
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,540
upon him, Wilhelm shuns them
in favor of the Prussian way.

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,270
Wilhelm was military service began at
the age of 21 he was given the rank of

66
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:57,380
first left tannins in the first regimen
to foot guards spaced in Potsdam.

67
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,990
He talked to army life
like a duck to water.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,300
He later said the following
about his time in the military.

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,730
I really found my family, my
friends, and my interests.

70
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:08,690
Everything of which I up to that time
had to do without above all his time in

71
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,590
the military and viewed the young
prince with self confidence.

72
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,040
See became assurer in his bearing and he
began to speak with an air of authority.

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,470
However,
the more he developed as a military man,

74
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,390
the more distant he
became from his parents.

75
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,490
He viewed them as being too invested in
British and liberalism at the expense of

76
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:26,750
Prussian nationalism.

77
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,700
Wilhelm was 21 when he met his future
wife or Augusta Victoria of [inaudible]

78
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,080
Holstine,
but she was also known as donor.

79
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,080
It wasn't as finessed foray of the heart
a couple of years before he had fallen

80
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,940
hard for his first cousin, Princess
Elizabeth of has said dumb starts,

81
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:44,360
but she had refused his marriage proposal,
not say with Donna,

82
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:48,920
and the couple got engaged in 1880 they
were married in 1881 and they'd go on to

83
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,590
have seven children following
his marriage Ville home games,

84
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,140
a powerful ally and the
form of Prussian statesmen,

85
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,340
Otto von Bismarck who saw the prince as
a means of advancing his own political

86
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:02,480
career. He would use the buy as a means
of gaining an advantage over that.

87
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:06,560
Parents with Bismarck pulling strings
Ville home began to be sent on diplomatic

88
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:07,100
missions.

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,820
The first was to Saint Petersburg to
attend to coming of age ceremony for 16

90
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:14,210
year old son of a bitch, Nicholas,
but the haughty and arrogant Ville.

91
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:18,770
How did not make a favorable impression
on Sar Alexandra up two years later in

92
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:23,360
1886 villain went with his grandfather
to visit the Austrian Hungarian emperor

93
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:24,320
from Joseph.

94
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,520
This trip went Besa Lanciani because
Ville home was under the ever watchful eye

95
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:31,280
of his grandfather,
Kaiser Wilhelm, the fast.

96
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,360
Meanwhile, Bismarck who act, it's
preparing Ville home for Ruda ship.

97
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,710
The encouraged him to view all things
English with disdain and to reject the

98
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,700
worldview of his parents. Then not
march the ninth 1888 Kaysville home,

99
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:52,030
the first diet below homes.
Father now inherited the role,

100
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,610
but just a few months into his reign,
he succumbed to Throat Cancer Ville.

101
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,090
Helm now became at Kaiser Wilhelm,
the seconds of Prussia and Germany.

102
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,210
He was 29 years of age and the date
was June the 15th 1888 immediately upon

103
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,880
ascending, sending the Throne Ville home
came into conflict with his advisors.

104
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,130
Chief among them was Otto von Bismarck.

105
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,060
The experienced statesmen advocated a
policy of peaceful relations with the

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,590
other heads of states in Europe,

107
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,150
but Ville helm was intent on extending
the territorial borders of Germany and

108
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:23,180
was ready to pursue an
aggressive international stops.

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,020
Bismarck had been the trusted foreign
adviser to Kaiser Wilhelm the first,

110
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,710
but the new Kaiser had no assumptions,
trust for the Statesman for his part.

111
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,460
Bismarck thought once Ville home ascended
to the throne that he would be able to

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,090
manipulate and control him. He soon
realized that he'd been very wrong.

113
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,540
They'll Holmes tolerance for Bismarck
reached its limits when the old man tried

114
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,610
to implement an anti socialist policy.

115
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,610
Phil Hill oppose the policy
has every opportunity.

116
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,220
Eventually the two had a heated encounter,

117
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,280
which ended with Ville home demanding
Bismark's resignation. Yeah.

118
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,153
Yeah.

119
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,170
With ms as foreign minister, a balanced
state of peace existed between Germany,

120
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,340
France, and Russia. The Russians,
they now had no confidence in Ville.

121
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:11,840
Home's ability to maintain the peace
and so they grew closer with France.

122
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,460
The piece between Russia and Germany,
the guns grow increasingly fragile.

123
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,420
In the early 19 hundreds Ville home
focused on building up Germany's navy,

124
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,250
he saw a powerful navy as being a
symbol of Germans position as a world

125
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,300
superpower and he became obsessed
with the idea of huge ships.

126
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,420
Many hours of spent drawing
his own designs of ships.

127
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,590
They also made sure to let the rest of
Europe know how he was building up his

128
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,000
nation's military might.

129
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,850
At the same time that he was
stretching his international muscles,

130
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:43,010
Ville home was making
domestic improvements.

131
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,310
He reformed public education to
make it available to every child.

132
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,680
He was also an advocate
of the arts and sciences,

133
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,850
starting the Kaiser Wilhelm Society to
advanced scientific research. Ville.

134
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,540
Ham had by now managed do alien aids.
Most of the leaders of Europe,

135
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,020
he was lacking in patients. He had an
explosive temper and it's possessed.

136
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
No tact whatsoever.

137
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,980
And infamous example of his ability to
alienate others was when in 1896 he sent

138
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:11,000
a telegram to President Kruger of the
Transvaal Republic in South Africa.

139
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,420
The message congratulated Crew Agatha
is suppression of the British led

140
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:17,440
Jamestown rate.
When news of the telegram reached Brisen,

141
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,030
it caused an outcry of rage against
Germany even before this incident.

142
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,430
Even those in the British royal
family who were related to bill helm,

143
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,660
they didn't like him. In addition to
his natural arrogance is over racism,

144
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,860
alienated others.

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,920
He constantly warned European leaders of
the yellow peril referring to Japan and

146
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,364
China.

147
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,580
Wally was content's you
alienated the European powers.

148
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:48,880
Ville home went out of his way to develop
code your relations with the leaders

149
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:49,810
of the Ottoman Empire.

150
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,190
His first trip to Istanbul was in 1889
he made a deal to sell guns to the

151
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:55,710
Ottoman army.
Nine years later,

152
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,980
he undertook a month long trip through
the holy lands before heading home.

153
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,280
He professed his undying friendship for
the tax in 1905 Ville home committed,

154
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,230
one of his biggest diplomatic blunders
when he visited a Tangier in Morocco.

155
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,700
There. He met with representatives
of Sultan Abdulaziz
expressing his support for

156
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,960
Moroccans sovereignty.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,190
This was a direct challenge to the French
who has a large military presence in

158
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,910
Morocco. It also further alienated the
Kaiser from the international community,

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,840
what became known as the Moroccan
crisis also served to bring previous a

160
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:25,920
lifelong arrivals,

161
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,390
France and Britain closer together in
their opposition to the aggressive stance

162
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,840
of the German reared up in 1908 Deville
home agreed to an interview for the

163
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,730
British newspaper,
the Daily Telegraph,

164
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:39,090
seeing it as an opportunity to
strengthen Anglo German relations.

165
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,163
During the interview,

166
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,320
his fiery 10 we've got the better of
him and he managed to insult the British

167
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,790
people numerous times,

168
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,020
as well as insinuating that the Russians
and French had tried to pull Germany

169
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,050
into the second bar war,
the whole interview.

170
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,800
It was a disaster and it
greatly embarrassed the
German people goals were even

171
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,780
made for Ville. Home to Bab, to gate.

172
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,730
In the wake of the fallout
from the interview.

173
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,480
Phil home laid low offer a month he and
merge didn't he immediately forced as

174
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:07,590
Chancellor Prince Bulow to resign blaming
him for authorizing the disastrous

175
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:08,730
interview in the first place.

176
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,110
This was a terrible move and it lost in
a lot of the internal support that he

177
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:13,944
had remaining.

178
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,900
This episode stole away any of the self
confidence that avail home still hat he

179
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,910
fell into a deep state of depression.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,840
All of his energy was thrown into his pet
project of building up the German navy.

181
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,590
His obsession with building more powerful
battleships and the British got his

182
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,990
country into serious financial hardship.

183
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,830
By the beginning of 1914 Ville home had
managed to alienate all of the major

184
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:43,910
powers in Europe and doing all of the
work that Bismarck had done when they'll

185
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,110
home.
The fast was Kaiser.

186
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,190
One of the few friends that he had was
Ferdinand's the archduke of Austria,

187
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,180
the assassination,

188
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:54,770
the third and ends on June the 28th of
1914 deeply affected Ville home when it

189
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:58,220
was revealed this an underground movement
called the black hands was behind the

190
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:02,070
murder. He extended his full support
in hunting them down. He also, uh,

191
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,751
just Austria,

192
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:06,740
Hungary to use force against Serbia
in buying that he would back them up.

193
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,650
Bag Dawn by Ville Helm Franz Joseph,
the fast of Austria,

194
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:13,640
made demands of Salvia that
were impossible to meet
when the deadline to meet

195
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:17,660
the conditions past without satisfaction.
Australia declared war on Saudi Yap.

196
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,590
In response to this,

197
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:22,850
Russian troops began to mobilize in
order to defend Serbia from attack home

198
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,060
learns of the Russian
mobilization on July the 30th.

199
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,230
He knew that his treaty obligations with
Austria meant that he was bounced to

200
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,460
declared war on Russia.

201
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,100
He was also convinced that England and
Russia and France and conspired to knock

202
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:40,010
out Germany. This meant that he would
be faced with attack from two fronts.

203
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,120
The Russians from the east, and it's
the British and French from the West.

204
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,270
Back in 1905 prominent German general by
the name of von Schlieffen had devised

205
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,400
a plan of attack on France.

206
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,080
Now the generals nephew Helmuth von Moltke
adapted the plan to fight a two front

207
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:02,530
war.

208
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,940
The plan calls for a preemptive strike
on the weaker country that we could come.

209
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,460
It was France. Why is that attack
had been successfully carried out.

210
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,880
The focus could then switch to Russia
Ville helm. He was sold on the plan,

211
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,830
but as general not so much.

212
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,370
They were convinced that Russia was not
prepared for war in wanting to strike to

213
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,360
the east first.

214
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,620
The reality was that the Russians were
indeed ready and had the army mobilized

215
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,870
to defend the Serbians Ville home.
Build his way,

216
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,420
though in the Schlieffen plan
was put into action. However,

217
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,280
it proved to be a disaster.

218
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,980
As the German war effort nudged
Donville homes influenced,

219
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:37,290
became less and less as
Germany's top military officials
field marshal pull them,

220
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,900
Hindenburg and general. Eric
alluded, Dorf took the reins.

221
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,650
The Kaiser busy didn't self with awarding
medals and officiating at military

222
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,510
ceremonies.
His moods follow day.

223
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,530
Manic depressive passion fluctuating
between euphoria that Germany was about to

224
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:55,450
crush the allies and dispatch all was
lost as the war drew to a conclusion.

225
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,270
In the closing months of 1918 us,

226
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,670
President Woodrow Wilson announced that
the German Kaiser would not be permitted

227
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,100
to take part in any peace negotiations.

228
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,770
This effectively made Phil
home a lame duck leader

229
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,360
as gem and capitulation drew ever naira.
A revolts broke out in Germany.

230
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,470
The vast majority of people,

231
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,320
they were just sick and tired of
this bundling arrogant leader.

232
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,190
There were calls for his abdication,
Still Ville,

233
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:25,480
him vacillated even
without any support at all.

234
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:28,780
He thought that he could retain at
least one or even two of his crowns,

235
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,070
but the constitution that stipulated
that the two crowns were to be forever

236
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,180
intertwined. Application from one thrown
meant abdication from both of them.

237
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,320
On November the ninth chancellor Prince
Max von Barden announced that Ville helm

238
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,830
was abdicating. He did this in order
to stem the tide of revolution,

239
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,700
but the chancellor's efforts,
they backfired and he
himself was forced to resign.

240
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,970
However, the next day, November the
10th of Wilhelm fled to the Netherlands.

241
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,180
At this time, he had still not
abdicated. Over the next weeks. However,

242
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,590
his top military advisor,

243
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:00,370
Paul von Hindenburg advise and abdication
the general made it clear that Ville

244
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:04,150
helm did not enjoy the support of the
army and so they would not back him when

245
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,600
they returned from the war. Realizing
that the situation was untenable.

246
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,630
Wilhelm faced reality and abdicated on
November the 28th 1918 the treaty of

247
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:17,560
Versailles which officially ended the
war with signs on June the 28th 1919 in

248
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:21,370
branded Kaysville helm is a war criminal
and stipulated that he'd be prosecuted

249
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:25,360
for a supreme offense against
international morality and the sanctity of

250
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,280
treaties, the Netherlands
governments. However,

251
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,780
they refused to extradite Philhealth.

252
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,440
The situation was actually pleasing to
President Wilson who felt that the trial

253
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:36,520
and prosecution of the Kaiser would only
prolonged tensions between Germany and

254
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,270
the rest of Europe.

255
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,150
The best thing would just be for bill
home to remain in the Netherlands.

256
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,600
Ville home purchased a house
in the municipality of dawn.

257
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,350
He would remain there
for the rest of his life.

258
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,980
The new German Weimar Republic allows
him to transport some of his possessions

259
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,160
there from his old palace and Potsdam.

260
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,430
He now made it his life's mission to clear
his name of wrongdoing and it came to

261
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:06,110
the war in April, 1921 villa homes wife
Donna. She died a few months earlier.

262
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,570
Their son had committed suicide.
These deaths,

263
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,570
a devastating blow to the XL Kaiser.

264
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,800
In 1922 William wrote a memoir in which
he defended his international policy and

265
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,950
but forth his case that he was not
responsible for a war that had led to 10

266
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,530
million deaths. At the same time, he
became socially active in the Netherlands,

267
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:28,820
entertaining high profile guests and
engaging his passions for archeology and

268
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:33,380
hunting. He also started a new hobby,
wood chopping, despite his with a arm.

269
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,020
He became quite proficient at it,

270
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,750
chopping down thousands of trees during
the last two decades of his life.

271
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,620
In mid 1922 bill Holm,
that princess mine reus of Greece,

272
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,680
there was an immediate mutual attraction
and they were married on November the

273
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,514
ninth

274
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,700
during the 1930 is villa home paid
close attention to the rise of Nazi-ism.

275
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,500
He never embraced the
pottery or it's neater,

276
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,130
but did hold out hope that Hitler
would eventually restore the monarchy.

277
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,450
It was his vain hope that his oldest
grandson would be appointed as Kaiser.

278
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:06,780
Once that occurred,
his wife,

279
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:09,650
how mean even sent a request
to that effect out of Hitler,

280
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,610
but the fear of being wasn't interested
in fact seat and held a special hatred

281
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:17,570
favilla him blaming him for the disastrous
defeat in the first world war as well

282
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,040
as actions became more extreme.

283
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,190
The former leader of Germany observing
from his ex out home in the Netherlands

284
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,610
became increasingly alarmed at what
was taking place under Nazi rule.

285
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,760
When he had heard that Hitler ordered
the murder of the wife of the chancellor.

286
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:29,540
He commented,

287
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,440
we have ceased to live under the rule
of law and everyone must be prepared for

288
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:37,700
the possibility that the Nazis will push
their way in and put them up against a

289
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,180
wall. Villa homes antipathy
towards Hitler became personal.

290
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,020
He believed that the Futura was turning
his cherish and military into a gang of

291
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:49,030
thugs. However, has hit the guns at rack
of international military victories,

292
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,890
fell home, changed his tune,
and again preys upon him.

293
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,000
When the Netherlands were occupied in
May of 1940 he received the following

294
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,160
message from Phil Helm,
my fear.

295
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,190
I congratulate you and hope that
under your marvelous leadership,

296
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,600
the German monarchy will be
restored completely Hitler.
I wasn't amused. In fact,

297
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,100
he referred to as home as an idiot.

298
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,190
That's impression was reinforced
when following the fall of Paris.

299
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,460
He received this message,
congratulations, you have won.

300
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,460
Using my trips under
the German occupation,

301
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,650
Phil Holmes House was kept under German.
God,

302
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,730
this was more there to provide protection
for the old Kaiser who was now 82 than

303
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:23,564
to imprison him.

304
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,690
It was done at the behest
of a Nazi general and when
hit the found out about it,

305
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,330
he was furious and had the general fired

306
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,960
Geyserville homeless second dies on June
the fourth 1941 of a pulmonary embolism

307
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,980
in the death of Hitler saw an
opportunity to make political capital.

308
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,220
He ordered the body be returned
to Berlin for a state funeral.

309
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,820
He saw this as a way of showing to the
German people that the Third Reich was

310
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,340
just a continuation of
the old German empire,

311
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,320
but Hedlands wishes they were denied.

312
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,890
Phil home had made it clear to the Dutch
authorities that he would never return

313
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,170
to Germany until the
monarchy was restored.

314
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,350
The Dutch government has seeded to these
wishes and the body remained in the

315
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,600
Netherlands where he was
given a military funeral.

316
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,000
He was buried in a mausoleum
on the property of dawn.

317
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,350
That was his Dutch home there.
It remains to this very day,

318
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,660
so I really hope you found my
video. Interesting. If you did,

Brand new videos several times a week,

321
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,300
and if you want something else
that's a bit different. Indeed,

322
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,980
it's not actually a youtube channel.
I do a podcast called the brain food show.

323
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,370
If you just search brain food one
word in Itunes, you'll find it.

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,040
Go give it a listen and let me
know what you think and as always,

thank you for watching.
