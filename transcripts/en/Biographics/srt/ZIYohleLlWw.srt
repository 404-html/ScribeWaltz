1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,461
Nine,

2
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:00,611
oh,

3
00:00:00,611 --> 00:00:02,800
2:00 AM on April the 19th,

4
00:00:02,801 --> 00:00:04,030
1995.

5
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,940
That's the moments when 27
year old Timothy Mcveigh
exploded his way into the U.

6
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:13,540
S history books blowing up a gigantic
truck bomb outside the Alfred p,

7
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,120
Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City,

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,870
the blast and Nylisa,

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,610
the building,

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,890
it ended 168 lives,

11
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:22,930
including those of 19 children.

12
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,020
It also sends a shockwave
throughout the nation.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,310
No one could believe such an atrocity
was carried out by a fellow American,

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,760
especially one has normal
seeming as my cafe.

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,030
Yeah,

16
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,530
it's Mcveigh's consciousness.

17
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,120
It didn't spring from nowhere.

18
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,920
He was a decorated war veteran,

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,710
a second amendment crusader,

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,340
and a foreign right activist.

21
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,180
More than that,

22
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,530
he was a product of his time,

23
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,040
a monster born from some of the most
controversial actions the federal

24
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,340
government's has ever been
involved in acquired loner.

25
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,020
A bullied kid who never fit in Mugabe
was the most average by imaginable.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,580
And in the video today,

27
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,770
the story of how that boy became
America's deadliest terrorist.

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,970
If you drive to upstate New York
to the town of Pendleton today,

29
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:22,410
you'll find a small blue collar community
identical to a million others across

30
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,160
America.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,690
There's no historical market here.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,710
That's nothing to commemorate the town
that gave birth to Timothy Mcveigh,

33
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,890
born in nearby lockport on April the 23rd,

34
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,311
19,

35
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:32,891
68.

36
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:37,350
Young Timothy was the middle child in a
household that was as boring as it was.

37
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,184
Dysfunctional.

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,850
His father,

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,440
Bill works endless shifts,

40
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,550
do support his family,

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,761
one,

42
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,450
his mother,

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,010
mickey divided his time between going on
the road for work and going on the road

44
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,090
with other men.

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,900
Years later,

46
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Tim would say that he and
his as patty and Jennifer,

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,600
so almost nothing of
their parents growing up.

48
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,790
Not that the children are isolated,

49
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,680
good Catholics from Irish stock.

50
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,060
The next phase were fixtures at the local
church and generally the sort of lines

51
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,950
you'd expect from small town.

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,783
Nobody's.

53
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,260
When Mickey finally left in 1978 and
took he and Jennifer to live in Florida.

54
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,620
It was just another chapter
in that American classic,

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,590
the Great Big Book of suburban misery,

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,530
but 10 year old 10 being
left alone with dad,

57
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,890
bill effectively meant
being left entirely alone.

58
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,180
There was nothing to do in
pendleton and nobody to do it with,

59
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,320
especially not when you were a lanky
intelligence and painfully shy boy,

60
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,860
but nobody seemed to understand.

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,580
The only person Tim really connected
to in those days was his grandpa.

62
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,720
The two would go shooting together a rare
escape from the beatings that Timothy

63
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:42,300
received at school as he
entered his teenage years,

64
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,080
the boy mockingly called noodle by his
classmates again to develop a vague

65
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,040
paranoia that the governments might come
and take his beloved guns way depriving

66
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,760
him of this one last escape
from this miserable life.

67
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,690
It was a feeling that he found
reflected in the Turner diaries.

68
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,501
Now,

69
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,430
if you've never heard
of the Turner diaries,

70
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,060
you're probably going to have a
fairly miserable next 30 seconds.

71
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,440
They were written by a Neo Nazi
called William Luther Paris in 1978,

72
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,520
and the book features a white uprising
against the Jews and blacks who are

73
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,990
controlling America.

74
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:18,310
And it culminates in the whites
committing a justified genocide.

75
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,120
In short,

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,800
the diaries is as a textbook definition
of racism as you're ever likely to find

77
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,880
the sort of book Hitler would
gobble up for his Nazi breakfast.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,270
Yet it also contains perhaps
the key to make these actions.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,290
In one passage,

80
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,070
the heroes detonate a truck bomb
outside of federal building,

81
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:41,071
killing 800 people for 14 year old timothy
reading the Turner diaries was like

82
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,880
someone had opened his eyes,

83
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,720
pierced his book,

84
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,370
taps into the deep paranoia.

85
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,410
The young boy was already feeling.

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,260
He became a sort of teenage survivalist,

87
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:54,130
stockpiling food for a nuclear war
that was never commons ramping up his

88
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,840
defenses of the second amendment.

89
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,460
Plenty of teenagers though they go
through phases of extremist belief only to

90
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,560
later turn into completely normal adults.

91
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,440
And this is something that
almost happened to Timothy,

92
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,830
something of a computer whiz.

93
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,720
He graduated high school in
1986 with a partial scholarship.

94
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,450
At this point,

95
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,140
the boy's life.

96
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,070
It could have taken a permanent
turn for the ordinary,

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,353
but it didn't.

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,321
For whatever reason,

99
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,710
Timothy dropped out after two
years of bumming around Pendleton.

100
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,660
He made the decision that would change
his life and the lives of 168 people

101
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,400
living in Oklahoma City forever.

102
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,410
He decided to join the army.

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,580
Yeah,

104
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,870
it was spring of 1988.

105
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,680
When mcvay graduated from boot camp,

106
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,830
I became a paid member of the US military.

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,940
Why all accounts?

108
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,050
It was a model soldier.

109
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,170
He even managed to make real friends
for perhaps the first time in his life,

110
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:51,820
pairing up with two guys called Michael
Fortier and Terry Nichols like America.

111
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,280
Vein Nichols was a guy from Nowheresville
with an absent father like Nichols was

112
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:00,140
a second amendment advocate
with a creeping distrust
of the government and like

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,390
make a a Nicole's would soon choose to
express that distrust through a horrific

114
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,224
violence,

115
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,580
but before we get into that,

116
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,030
we first got to take a quick
trip to the Arabian desert.

117
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,220
August the second 1990,

118
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,530
and Saddam Hussein's
army rolls into Kuwait,

119
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,800
leaving a trail of horror in its wake.

120
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,080
Ordinary courageous are
abducted off the streets,

121
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:23,800
tortured to death and their bodies
and dumped on their families' lawns.

122
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,680
Over 400,000 people flee the country.

123
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,050
Faced with a humanitarian catastrophe,

124
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:34,051
george h dot w dot Bush orders the US
army to create borders along with them as

125
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,470
Timothy Mcveigh now,

126
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:36,171
a special gunner,

127
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:40,630
mcveigh was at the head of a column that
rolled into occupied Kuwait on January

128
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,321
the 17th,

129
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,250
1991.

130
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,630
He witnessed the fist fighting and the
collapse of the Iraqi army firsthand.

131
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,380
Indeed,

132
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,920
he fired one of the earliest shots of
the war as his column moved into the

133
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:55,030
desert and they pulled the trigger on a
cannon shot that blue and Iraqi soldiers

134
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,260
head clean off,

135
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,490
although he celebrated at the time.

136
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,270
He later told his official biography is
that the image of the men's upper body

137
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:06,890
disappearing in a spray of red mist
came to haunt him as his platoon march,

138
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,710
north along dusty highways
and listed with burns out.

139
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,010
Wreckages have destroyed
Iraqi vehicles is celebration.

140
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,120
It gave way to horror by the time
the war ended on February the 28th,

141
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,430
something inside and they had gone out.

142
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,550
Some vital spark of empathy had gone
and it was never to be rekindled.

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,040
The next few months were rough
for the decorated soldier,

144
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
absolutely exhausted by the Gulf War.

145
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,180
Mcvay flunked the army
special forces training.

146
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,080
After two days,

147
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,710
he took an honorable discharge and
returned to pendleton where you failed to

148
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,640
find steady work,

149
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,530
traumatized and directionless.

150
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,890
He returns to his one real love guns.

151
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,030
In 1991,

152
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:47,840
the gun show Sackett was a place of
itinerant wonder is fanatics and didn't

153
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,531
things he asks.

154
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,510
He lived a nomadic existence,

155
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,310
rooming the empty planes of
America and hawking their wares.

156
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,790
Mcvay joins that number,

157
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,740
flogging copies of his
childhood favorites.

158
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,980
The Turner diaries do a receptive
antigovernment audience.

159
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,680
At some point he made contact
again with Terry Nichols,

160
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:06,950
who left the army on a hardship
discharge before the Gulf War.

161
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,470
The two went into business
selling army sepsis.

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
As they spend more and more time together,

163
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:15,080
they fed fuel into the fire of one
another's resentment of the government,

164
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,810
but it would be two major events that
would turn those smoldering embers into an

165
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,830
apocalyptic wildfires.

166
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,601
At the same time,

167
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:32,470
Timothy Mcveigh was becoming desensitized
to violence in the Arabian desert and

168
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:36,460
anonymous man named Randy Weaver
was missing his Idaho court date.

169
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,800
A former green baret
weaver had taken his wife,

170
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:43,060
Vicky and that children and retreated
into a tiny survivalist cabin overlooking

171
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,890
Ruby creek in 1989.

172
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,460
ATF agents try to turn them into
an format when we ever refused.

173
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:52,000
He was indicted on firearms
offenses in February 1991.

174
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,250
He failed to show up at his trial and an
arrest warrant was issued on August the

175
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,400
21st 1992 us marshals finally
tracked weaver to his cabin.

176
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,450
As they approached,

177
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,460
we've as dark striker started barking.

178
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,450
Fourteen year old Sammy weaver came out
of the cabin running with his gun in

179
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:08,020
hand.

180
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,310
What exactly happened next?

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,233
No one knows.

182
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,180
What we do know is that when
the dust cleared striker,

183
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,430
Sammy and Deputy Marshal Bill Degan,

184
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,750
they were all debt.

185
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,960
The FBI laid siege to the cabin on
August the 22nd FBI sniper lawn hurry,

186
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,210
cheese shot randy as he
tried to check on Sammy body,

187
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,500
randy rand for safety.

188
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,890
And how are you?

189
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,140
Chief?

190
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,700
Find again this time his
shot missed the window,

191
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,020
randy as Vicky weaver
stepped up to the doorway,

192
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,850
her newborn child in her arms,

193
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,540
but it struck her through her
head and she died instantly.

194
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,460
The deaths of Sammy and Vicky waiver.

195
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,670
We're like a lightening bolt
to the heart of the guns,

196
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:44,200
second from mcveigh and
nickels and others like them.

197
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:48,340
Ruby Ridge was proof that the government
was coming for your guns and that kill

198
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,890
your entire family in order to get them.

199
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,280
It was in the shadow of this tragedy
that's an even greater and even more

200
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,150
controversial.

201
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,370
A cod,

202
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,720
and you'll certainly recognize the
name of this one because it was Waco on

203
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,590
February the 28th,

204
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:01,981
19,

205
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,650
93 ATF agents raided the branch Davidians,

206
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,480
religious compound outside of Waco,

207
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:10,090
after David Koresh was accused of
violating firearms regulations.

208
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,300
And if you do want to learn
more about David Koresh,

209
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,220
do check out our video about him.

210
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm going to link to it
in the description below.

211
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,860
Now that rate,

212
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,390
it turns into a massacre that killed
four atf agents and six Davidians.

213
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,930
The massacre then turned into a standoff
before transforming into a siege.

214
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,080
When the FBI got involved
for the next 51 days,

215
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,690
the world watched his
waco became a succuss.

216
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,900
The firearms angle drew and
protestors from across the country,

217
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:35,910
and among them was Timothy Mcveigh,

218
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,860
but they joined the crowd of journalists.

219
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:38,930
Protest isn't rubberneck,

220
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,130
is on a hill three miles
from the compounds watching
as all the action unfolded.

221
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,171
He hawks nt,

222
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:45,390
government bumper stickers,

223
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:48,570
and like many others
predicted another Ruby Ridge.

224
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,200
However,

225
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,050
he wouldn't be there to
see quite how right he was.

226
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,200
On April the 19th,

227
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,270
the FBI tried to storm the
compound instead to the
world watched in horror as it

228
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,230
went up in flames.

229
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,610
Billowing black smoke filled the sky
hanging in a poisonous cloud above Texas.

230
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,511
To this day,

231
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:06,090
the is still debate over
who started the fire,

232
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,370
but there's no debate over the outcome.

233
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,200
The charred corpses of 75 Davidians were
eventually pulled from the rubble among

234
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,034
them.

235
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,030
Twenty five children.

236
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:15,751
Look,

237
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:20,751
they watched the Davidians burn live on
tv from Nicole says couch on his farm in

238
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:21,660
Michigan.

239
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,950
Exactly what he felt.

240
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,470
Seeing his darkest fears
realized is of course unknown,

241
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,770
but we do know that in the aftermath,

242
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,370
mcgann Nichols began experimenting
with building pipe bombs.

243
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,130
They're angry at the government
had reached a boiling point,

244
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:38,850
and the two men began the
slow slide toward extremism,

245
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,420
and of course committing
horrifying vengeance.

246
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,330
In September of 1994,

247
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:53,780
President Bill Clinton signed
into law the assault weapons ban,

248
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:58,070
briefly outlawing certain
types of firearms coming in
the wake of Ruby Ridge and

249
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:58,730
Waco.

250
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,900
The band was like tossing gasoline onto
the fire of anti government propaganda.

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,170
Mcgarvey would lay to claim
that this was the last straw.

252
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,060
Initially the young extremist.

253
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:11,450
He hoped to assassinate prominent figures
in the federal government among his

254
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:11,780
dog.

255
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,750
What Attorney General
Janet Reno Lawn Hurry,

256
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:15,111
Archie,

257
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:18,410
the FBI sniper who'd killed
Vicky Weaver at Ruby Ridge,

258
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,950
but this planet soon fizzles getting
past and bodyguards was too tricky and

259
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:25,820
there was no guarantee mcvay would be
able to assassinate even a single figure

260
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,960
before being caught.

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,770
Instead,

262
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,560
he turns to an unlikely
source of inspiration,

263
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,660
Islamic fundamentalism.

264
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,561
The year before,

265
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:35,200
just three days before the waco siege,

266
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,610
just small Islamist cell had exploded,

267
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:39,650
a truck bomb beneath the
world trade center up.

268
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,560
The boss had been intended
to collapse the north tower,

269
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,570
killing hundreds of people in the end,

270
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,810
though it failed to damage the foundations
and killed only six people from like

271
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,970
the 1993,

272
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:54,100
WTC bombing was a source of
both inspiration and contempts.

273
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,490
While he was impressed that such a
small salad manage to attack such a high

274
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,570
profile landmark,

275
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,450
you considered their attack
a failure in later years.

276
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:06,340
He admitted to studying for bombing
obsessively and he vowed that he could do

277
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,240
better.

278
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,710
His first step was to get Terry Nichols
involved richer than mcvay and with more

279
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,260
practical knowledge and explosives,

280
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,210
Nichols was necessary for
the success of any attack.

281
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,260
So in late September,

282
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,530
mcvay took him to one side and
explained his plan together.

283
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,840
The two of them were going to
blow up the federal building,

284
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,240
just like in the town of diaries,

285
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,090
and a happier world would
have responded by saying,

286
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
yeah,

287
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,410
a short end and then
immediately alerting the FBI.

288
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:35,080
But this isn't a happier weld.

289
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,980
The feds,

290
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,550
they were the enemy and Nichols was just
as angry and just as ready to lash out

291
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,110
at the government as mcvay was.

292
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,490
So when mcvay said,

293
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,800
let's build a bum nichols.

294
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,663
He simply said,

295
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,660
well,

296
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,493
yeah.

297
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,563
Throughout September,

298
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,940
the slowly began amassing
bags of fertilizer.

299
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,170
When they weren't buying,

300
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,750
they were hanging out with our
old buddy Michael 40 errands,

301
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,300
setting off pipe bombs
in secluded canyons,

302
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,370
biography about mcvay.

303
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,950
They had made a connection who promised
to sell them nitromethane a highly

304
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:04,240
potent racing fuel.

305
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,550
On October the 20th of
the Padre have to Dallas,

306
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,210
Texas to pick up a batch on the
way they stopped in Oklahoma City.

307
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,140
Today,

308
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,130
a controversy remains over the points at
which mcvay decided to bomb the Alfred

309
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,480
p Murrah Federal Building,

310
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,000
some belief the decision
was taken in September.

311
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:22,780
Others believe that wasn't until the
morning of the bombing when the original

312
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,940
target have to be scrapped
at the last minutes,

313
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,110
whatever the truth,

314
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,970
the FBI's official chronology of Mcveigh's
movements in the fall of 1994 states

315
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,210
that he had nichols pulled over outside
the Murrah building on their way to

316
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:36,400
Dallas long after he was arrested,

317
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,320
like they would say,

318
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,090
had originally chosen another
federal building in the city,

319
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,730
but had a change of
heart when he noticed it.

320
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,840
How is the flower store?

321
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,501
Evidently,

322
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:48,340
he felt no such reluctance when he
saw the Mara Buildings Daycare Center.

323
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,970
It was during the Dallas trip that
mcvay got some unfortunate news.

324
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,790
His grandfather had passed
away following a long illness.

325
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,730
The man who'd once been young timothy,

326
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:59,020
his only friend was now gone,

327
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,093
and with that,

328
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,040
I think there's lost connection
to the world was severed.

329
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,290
The next few months unfolded in a
haze of petty crimes of fertilizers,

330
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,910
stockpiling and mind numbing normalcy.

331
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,440
I think they visited gun shows,

332
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,630
try to hook up with women
and even took a vacation.

333
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,611
This building,

334
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,660
this average bustle of life,

335
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,810
something much darker was
beginning to take shape.

336
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,770
Nichols by now we're stealing guns to
generate funding and the two were slowly

337
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:28,290
filling countless drums with
fertilizer and with fuel as a 1994,

338
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,950
six over into 1995.

339
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,450
Mcvay was making more and more trips to
Oklahoma City at least once with 40 year

340
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,220
in tow away from his future target,

341
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,480
though he was starting to
dabble and crystal meth and
acid as the winter slipped

342
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,160
away into spring mcveigh,

343
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,140
he caught himself off from everyone,

344
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,880
even nichols by April.

345
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,230
He was spending long nights sleeping in
his car and lying low in motels at some

346
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:50,900
point 40 years.

347
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,810
Wife made him a fake id to
use for renting vehicles.

348
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,950
The glaze last week as a free
man is still shrouded in mystery.

349
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,900
He rented a hotel room in junction city,

350
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:04,580
Kansas and may have been
spotted conversing with still
unidentified men at some

351
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:04,840
point,

352
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,500
a man known as John Doe to allegedly
rented the rider truck used in the blast

353
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,310
eye witness accounts of due to fuel
conspiracy theories about the bombing to

354
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,320
this very day as Easter Sunday.

355
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,670
Nineteen 95 arrived.

356
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,570
Nichols finally traveled down to
Kansas on April the 18th in mcvay,

357
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,990
drove out to Gary Lake with
our fertilizer and fuel.

358
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,760
As the sun came up over the water,

359
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,410
they mixed their ingredients together,

360
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:29,650
creating a highly unstable bomb.

361
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,620
By noon,

362
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,453
they were done.

363
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,610
Mcveigh's said goodbye.

364
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:36,350
He goes back and the Ryder truck and drove
off into the bright spring afternoon.

365
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,500
The next time Nicholas,

366
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,190
how it is old friends name
it would be in for this.

367
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,490
On April the 19th,

368
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:51,600
1995 state Trooper Charlie Hangar was out
patrolling the empty highways north of

369
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:54,820
Oklahoma City when he spotted
a car driving without place.

370
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,570
It had been a heavy morning hanging out,

371
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,360
just heard on the radio that some kind
of explosion had happened in Oklahoma

372
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,450
City and all the cops in the area
were converging on the disaster,

373
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,150
but hangar was nothing if not by the book.

374
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:10,110
So rather than turn his car around and
scream towards the smoke-filled skyline,

375
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,710
he flicked on his lights and
pulled over the battered old.

376
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,640
This mercury or gone to young
man was sat in the driver's seat.

377
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,180
A common expression on his face as
hanging around to see his license.

378
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,410
He noticed a bulge under the young
man's jacket he was carrying and illegal

379
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,310
concealed weapon.

380
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,910
Young then followed hang as
iron line and gave a tight grin.

381
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,140
My gun is loaded.

382
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,890
Officer,

383
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,723
he said,

384
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,593
so is mine.

385
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,650
Revlite hanger,

386
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,100
Yanking his pistol out and pointing
it to the young man's head as hang a

387
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,640
drover's prisoner back towards Perry
and the local county courthouse.

388
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,730
He was passed by more vehicles
speeding towards Oklahoma city.

389
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,760
It never even occurred to him
that he might have the bommer.

390
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,200
Saturn is backseat.

391
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,020
The Oklahoma City bomb
had exploded at nine.

392
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:52,171
Oh,

393
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:54,150
2:00 AM in front of the Murrah building.

394
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,060
The blasted,

395
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,870
removed the north wing and
collapsed all nine floors.

396
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Windows 25 miles away had shaken
from the shockwave in the aftermath.

397
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,770
Ordinary Oklahomans that watched in
horror as the bloodied corpses of children

398
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:08,940
were pulled from the huddle,

399
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,150
all told a 168 lives had been
snuffed out as news spreads suited.

400
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,830
The suspicion that a
foreign power was involved,

401
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,690
the bomb was simply too powerful.

402
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,280
The media broadcast stories about Arab
terrorists attacking the heartland grave,

403
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,290
looking spokespeople.

404
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,630
It came on TV and said
that was a possibility.

405
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,481
Saddam Hussein,

406
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,660
it actually orchestrated the
attack and very courthouse.

407
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:33,520
Timothy Mcveigh commonly
watched these reports unfold.

408
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,523
At that moment.

409
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,340
He was the most wanted man on the planet.

410
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,950
No one had the faintest inkling that he
was already in jail on Friday morning,

411
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,090
two days after the bombing,

412
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,640
mcveigh was about to go and
see the judge and post bail.

413
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,160
When a forensic FBI operates,

414
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,831
called Charlie,

415
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:50,360
hanging out to ask if it's traffic
violation was still sitting in the cells.

416
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,930
Hang.

417
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,570
I said,

418
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:51,930
well,

419
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,620
sure.

420
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,450
Keeping there the operator box.

421
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,470
Whatever you do,

422
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,030
do not let him go.

423
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,931
By fluke,

424
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,870
the Ryder trucks axel had
been destroyed in the blast,

425
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,000
held two blocks through the air.

426
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,790
It had been recovered with its
serial number still intact.

427
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,510
The FBI managed to trace it back to a
motel where mcvay had stayed using his

428
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:13,010
real name and with that
the game was up in Perry,

429
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,520
a mob of angry Oklahomans
surrounded the courthouse.

430
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,990
Has Federal agents arrested
mcvay Sean solve baby killer,

431
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,200
filled the APP as he was dragged
out into the media spotlight,

432
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,050
mcvay seemed totally
unfazed by the attention.

433
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,180
He simply scans the nearby rooftops,

434
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,150
his eyes flitting from one to
the other with an eerie calm.

435
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,260
Mcvay would later say that he was sure
and FBI sniper was amounts taken out as

436
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,690
they had with Vicky weaver
three years earlier.

437
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,770
That would be bad because he didn't want
to die until he told his story until it

438
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,510
explained why he had done it.

439
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,570
It was sure that when the American
people heard his reasoning,

440
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,640
they would rise up
against the government's.

441
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,740
Just like in the Turner Diaries,

442
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,650
Timothy Mcveigh was
indicted on August the 10th,

443
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:53,820
1995.

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,833
Terry Nichols said,

445
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,190
surrender to authorities.

446
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:59,800
The day that mcvay was identified
and was charged as a coconspirator.

447
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,050
Michael Fortier was also arrested and
tenant star witness in return for a

448
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,970
lenient sentence of the three men.

449
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,050
Only 40 year would ever
tasted freedom again.

450
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,170
In the end of the trial of
Timothy Mcveigh took one month,

451
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,400
mcvay instructed his lawyers to use a
necessity defense arguing that he was in

452
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:26,510
immediate danger from the government and
the bombing was an act of self defense,

453
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,370
but there's as they refused.

454
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,480
At the end of the trial,

455
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:32,780
the jury unanimously recommended
death by Nathan injection.

456
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Terry Nichols was sentenced to a hundred
and 61 consecutive life sentences with

457
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,260
no possibility of parole.

458
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,880
Following Mcveigh's conviction,

459
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:44,660
do you balance Oklahomans paid to fly
the jury out to Oklahoma City and gave

460
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,690
them a vip tour for a brief
period after his trial.

461
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:49,580
Mcvay was incarcerated in Adx,

462
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:50,001
Florence,

463
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,090
Colorado in a wing known as bombers,

464
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,580
rope a real life Arkham asylum bombers.

465
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,350
Row was already homes the
unibomber Ted Kaczynski,

466
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,260
NWTC,

467
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,641
Bama,

468
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,230
Ramsey,

469
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,063
Yousef.

470
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,060
According to one of Mcveigh's biographers,

471
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,420
he and Kaczynski became firm friends
bonding over a love of nature.

472
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,090
Yusef meanwhile tried to convert to Islam,

473
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,160
but mcvay politely declined.

474
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,250
Mcveigh's never expressed
any remorse for his actions.

475
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:14,240
And in his biography,

476
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,570
he called the 19 dead
children collateral damage.

477
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,770
He maintains that the bombing was a
justified response to waco and he wasn't

478
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:22,400
alone.

479
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,370
The great writer golf,

480
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,840
it all became a pen pal of Mcveigh's
and spend the last years of his life

481
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,820
ultimately defending mcveigh's actions.

482
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:29,271
At one point,

483
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,920
comparing him to an American hero,

484
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:31,754
Paul Revere,

485
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,900
and suggesting that he was really
innocent while mcvay respected at all.

486
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,080
He had no truck with theories
that had been framed.

487
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,990
He had carried out in the morning
and he wanted everyone to know it.

488
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,740
Look was finally executed
on July the 11th,

489
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,030
2001 the day he was put to death.

490
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,730
So many natives of Oklahoma City.

491
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,350
You wanted to watch the monster die,

492
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,810
that a lottery system had to be set
up to ration places in the chain.

493
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:57,990
The the rest wants to fire a satellite
link from the very city mcvay had

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,500
callously torn the heart out of
any six years before at 7:15 AM,

495
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:07,501
Timothy Mcveigh became the first federal
prisoner to be executed since 1963 as a

496
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,420
cocktail of lethal drugs with
slowly pumped into a system.

497
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,770
He refused to say a word.

498
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,940
We're very calm.

499
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,690
He simply looked into the camera
broadcasting is death to Oklahoma City,

500
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,560
forcing his eyes to stay open even
as his heart slowed to a stop.

501
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,060
When he finally died,

502
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,040
his eyes remained fixed on the camera,

503
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,130
as if mocking those that had hurt so much,

504
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,840
but the moment when he died,

505
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,671
it was lost.

506
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,990
A mind of the deadliest
attack in US history.

507
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,160
It was the boy next door who read a book
and they're determined its plot into a

508
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,360
horrifying reality.

509
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,740
As his heart stopped,

510
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,760
it was on a world in which Americans
still feared the government and right wing

511
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,040
terra was the biggest
concern of law enforcement.

512
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,400
It was a world that mcvay
had helped to create,

513
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,600
but it wasn't one that would last exactly
three months after mcvay breathed his

514
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:56,320
last Islamic fundamentalists smashed
planes into the twin towers and the

515
00:21:56,321 --> 00:22:01,150
Pentagon killing 17 times as many as
mcvay had in the aftermath of nine slash

516
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:04,450
seven support for the government
surge to its highest level in decades.

517
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,790
Rightwing terror vanished
from the headlines,

518
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:11,791
replaced by the specter of
Islamic extremism in the
wake of nearly 3000 dead in

519
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:12,820
New York City.

520
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,760
The bombing of the Murrah
building was almost forgotten,

521
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,570
yet mcveigh's still holds a
special place in American history.

522
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,590
No domestic terrorist has ever equals
of the horrific acts that he carries out

523
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:24,670
that day and act,

524
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:28,720
which inspired everyone from the
columbine killers to Anders Breivik.

525
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,643
Even today,

526
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,590
he costs along poisonous
shadow once again.

527
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,200
Anti government further
is on the rise far right.

528
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,770
Extremists like dylan roof
and Pittsburgh shooter,

529
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,640
Robert bowers are sewing terror in
American communities as the world lurches

530
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,290
back towards a darker place.

531
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,000
It's worth remembering the life of Timothy
Mcveigh and the lessons that is awful

532
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,320
crime taught us all.

533
