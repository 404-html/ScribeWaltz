1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,220
As the founder of Playboy
magazine who half?

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:02,521
No,

3
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:05,730
it was one of the icons of the
sexual revolution in the 1960s.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,120
Opinions about half
now are very polarized,

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,520
either love and admire the man
who you completely disapprove of,

6
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,980
the multimillion dollar
empire that he created.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,400
But no matter how you
feel about Hugh Hefner,

8
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:20,580
there is no arguing that he was truly
a genius when it came to business.

9
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,030
And,

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,121
uh,

11
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,410
one of the kinds publisher,

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,390
writer and is on trapping now,

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,270
Hugh Austin half note was
born in Chicago in 1926.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,510
He grew up in the middle of prohibition
on his parents were conservative

15
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,290
Methodists.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,280
His mother was a teacher and his father
was an accountant during the Great

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,281
Depression.

18
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:53,150
His father was under a lot of pressure
to work as hard as he possibly could in

19
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:54,260
order to keep his job.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,860
He would leave the house before Hugh
and his brother key if even woke up for

21
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:00,050
school and he works late into the night.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,250
He was a very timid and shy Ellis or
why he preferred to read comic books and

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,143
watch movies.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,740
Most of the Hollywood starlets in the
1920s and thirties just happened to be

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,750
buxom blonde girls with
an hourglass figure,

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,100
and so you grew up escaping into a
fantasy world of romance and adventure,

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,950
wishing that he could
live inside these movies.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,510
In elementary school you did not talk
very much and he didn't seem to be paying

29
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,530
attention to class.

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,070
He spent most of his time drawing in his
notebooks with his mind ends up in the

31
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:28,850
clouds.

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,190
It was unresponsive to his
just questions as well,

33
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,340
so they thought that he might have
some sort of a learning disability.

34
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,420
His mother took him to a
child psychologist and it
turns out that he had an Iq

35
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,540
of 152 which makes them a genius.

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,350
The reality was that he was simply bored
with what he was learning in class.

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,300
When he started going to high school,

38
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:50,880
he had his heartbroken when a girl he had
a crush on started dating another boy,

39
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,310
and at this point he was still shy,

40
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,810
ended trouble communicating,

41
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:57,590
but the perceived rejection from
this gal was a wake up call.

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,401
From that moment on,

43
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,490
he realized that he needed to reinvent
himself if he ever wanted to get a

44
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:02,324
girlfriend.

45
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,150
He asked his friends to start
calling him half instead of humans.

46
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,830
He began to wear nicer clothes,

47
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,030
Cologne and stylists hat underneath
all of these outward improvements.

48
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,511
However,

49
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:16,340
he was still that hardcore film that he
wrote plays for the theater department

50
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:19,760
and he films his own horror movies with
a home video camera with his friends.

51
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,120
He worked on the school newspaper and
drew comic books in his spare time.

52
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,490
When he was 15 he created his own xen,

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,100
but he had fully illustrated
and he calls it shutter.

54
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,760
Yeah.

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,710
He wrote articles about horror movies.

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,460
He mess up with a group of friends after
school calls the shutter club where

57
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,650
they got together to watch
films and talk about them.

58
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,860
It was at this point that he finally
came out of his shell and he was popular

59
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:44,861
enough to be elected student body
president from 1944 to 1946 you have not

60
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,880
served in the U s army.

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,730
He used his talents in writing
to work in the military.

62
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,563
His newspaper,

63
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,820
since he did not have a combat position,

64
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:57,510
be lived out the adventures in his mind
by drawing comic books about fantasy

65
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,450
versions like one way here in a of his
friends were breaking prisoners out of a

66
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,740
Nazi concentration camp during World War
Two illustrations and photos of pinup

67
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:09,850
girls were extremely popular in order
to boost soldiers' morale that were even

68
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,060
paintings of Miss America
on the sides of airplanes,

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,000
bombers instead of staring at
scantily clad strangers in his bunk,

70
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,600
you have now gazed at photos
and letters from his fiance,

71
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,680
Miljard Williams.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,920
He was very much in love with her and
the plans again married when the war was

73
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,550
over.

74
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,280
After being discharged from the army,

75
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,800
you have no end to the University of
Illinois and double majored in psychology

76
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,700
and creative writing.

77
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,870
He excelled in school and he was able to
earn his bachelor's degree in just two

78
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,860
and a half years.

79
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,230
He also wrote for the College
newspaper and magazine.

80
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,110
He was eager to marry
Mildred after graduation,

81
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,650
but the idea that he was getting to
live out the plot of a Hollywood romance

82
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,810
when it came crashing
down before the wedding,

83
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,930
Mildred confessed that she had had an
affair when he was away in the army.

84
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,320
He forgave her though and he lost
his virginity on his wedding night.

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,450
They went on to have
two children together,

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,350
Christine and David.

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,460
He was very much in love with Mildred
and even though it broke his heart,

88
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,920
he believed in the old
traditional way of doing things.

89
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,630
During an interview
with the New York Times,

90
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,180
having to explained how he
felt on his wedding day,

91
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,250
the magic was gone from
the very beginning.

92
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,550
How would it have turned out without
the affair was like well suited for

93
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,270
marriage.

94
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,860
I didn't know boss.

95
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,270
I was truly crushed

96
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,580
after serving in the army and graduating
from college who have not got a job at

97
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:26,420
Esquire magazine,

98
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,930
making $60 a week with
modern day inflation.

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,050
That's about $645 a week after
working there for several years.

100
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:34,820
Half of the knew that
he was good at his job,

101
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,430
so he asked his boss
for a $5 a week raise.

102
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,530
This doesn't sound like a lot to ask,

103
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,150
but they still said no.

104
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,000
At this point he was starting to
have a bit of a quarter life crisis.

105
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,990
I've been doing last point.

106
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:48,530
He had followed all of the rules of living
the so called American dream that he

107
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,440
was unhappy with his job and he
was in an unfaithful marriage.

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,530
He decided that he truly
had nothing left to lose,

109
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:57,770
so he quit his job and worked
on starting his own magazine.

110
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,610
You have no knew from being in the army
that men love looking at pictures of

111
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:02,444
pinup girls.

112
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,010
When they came home from the war,

113
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,920
many men did not have access to it
anymore because it was illegal to send

114
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:10,460
anything that was considered pornographic
in the mail and that's how I men's

115
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,530
magazines were mostly about hunting,

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,010
fishing,

117
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,401
camping,

118
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,800
and cause have not sold.

119
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,420
This is a golden opportunity
to start his own publication.

120
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,730
The only issue was that
he was completely broke.

121
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,620
You borrowed $1,000 from his mother,

122
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
mortgaged out his furniture to the bank
for $600 and convinced several investors

123
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:30,100
to help him raise a total of $8,000 to
get the first issue of playboy started.

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,470
At first he thought about naming
the magazine's stag party.

125
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:34,940
You just decided against it.

126
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:37,400
Since there was already
a magazine called Stag,

127
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,150
you have no was able to by
Marilyn Monroe's nude photos
from accounting's as a

128
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:42,530
company who owned the rights.

129
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,150
These photographs were famous,

130
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:48,140
but since this was decades before people
could easily share is on the Internet.

131
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,580
Very few people that actually seen them
for just $200 he bought the rights to

132
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:56,000
the pictures and published them in the
very first issue of playboy Zinn's.

133
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:59,060
Marilyn Monro was of the
biggest celebrities of the time.

134
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,890
He couldn't have picked a better
woman to place on the cover.

135
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,020
Magazines were flying off the
shelves and they sold 50,000 copies.

136
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,800
The money they made from that issue
was just enough to make the seconds and

137
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,260
after a few months they
were turning a profit.

138
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,680
It soon enough they were selling over a
million copies a month and playboy was

139
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,660
essentially an overnight success.

140
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:17,961
Now,

141
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,140
it sounds like a joke when people say
they read playboy for the articles,

142
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,780
but there's actually a lot
of truth to that statement.

143
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,380
Hugh Hefner was always against censorship
in the media andZ ran one of the very

144
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:31,160
few publications where writers get to
express themselves without holding back.

145
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,240
Some of the greatest authors in the world
actually got their start writing for

146
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:35,900
playboy.

147
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,170
Ian Fleming was one of them and he
went on to write James Bond's and ray

148
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:43,400
Bradbury serialized chapters of Fahrenheit
four five one in the magazine before

149
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,690
publishing the complete novel.

150
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,710
Even Margaret Atwood published several
short stories in playboy before writing

151
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,180
our feminist dystopian novel.

152
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,890
The Handmaid's tale in the 1950s you
have not was defying all rational

153
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:59,891
convention and actually promoted feminism
and women's sexual liberation as well

154
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,040
as racial equality.

155
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,060
In 1959 a series called playboys
penthouse ad on the television.

156
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,110
For the first time,

157
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,950
women were shown on TV as more than
just housewives who were staying home to

158
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,900
make a dinner and take
care of the children.

159
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,230
The premise of the show was that the
viewer followed around half an hour as he

160
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,690
had to classy party in
his penthouse apartment.

161
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,010
Women Wa elegant dresses and men wore
suits as they drank cocktails and had

162
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,890
interesting conversations while
they listen to live jazz music.

163
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,450
It was sophisticated and that lifestyle
became an aspiration for many men and

164
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:31,190
women who watched the series.

165
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,300
Now at this point,

166
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,320
you have to his marriage,

167
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,090
it was crumbling and he and his wife,

168
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,150
Mildred had agreed to allow one
another to sleep with different people.

169
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,510
They officially called it quits
in 1959 and got a divorce,

170
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:46,130
which left him free to live the bachelor
lifestyle to match the playboy brand.

171
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,910
That same year,

172
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,420
he bought his first a mansion and
opens the playboy club in Chicago.

173
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,260
Soon enough,

174
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,370
he would open dozens of clubs all over
the country so that men could experience

175
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:58,670
the playboy and penthouse
lifestyle firsthand.

176
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,810
By the time he turned 35 the play by
empire had expanded to a lifestyle brand

177
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,000
worth $20 million.

178
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,830
As time winds on the magazine would come
to be published in over 180 countries

179
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,490
and it became one of the top
20 brands in the entire world,

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,140
right wing conservatives.

181
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,230
They were against playboy from the very
first issue because they considered the

182
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,090
magazine to be sinful trash.

183
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,440
He also gone a lot of criticism from the
left as well because feminists saw that

184
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:34,610
it was objectifying and over sexualizing
women rather than liberating them.

185
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,450
After receiving so much criticism who
haven't published a book called the

186
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,451
playboy philosophy in 1962 where are you
explains his ideas about sex in modern

187
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:47,420
culture and attends to explain his
thought process behind you're running the

188
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:48,110
business.

189
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,110
In 1963 a journalist named Gloria Steinem
went undercover for showing magazines

190
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:55,350
at work as a waitress and
one of the playboy clubs.

191
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,130
She found out that these girls were
being underpaid and as they were charged

192
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,461
fees,

193
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,350
whenever they committed,

194
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,820
even the smallest infractions,

195
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,450
like not smiling enough,

196
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,360
they were also being treated
very badly by the customers.

197
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,081
And in the ends,

198
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,680
women hardly made any money in
order to be sexually objectified.

199
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,310
Clients were given special keys that
allowed them to have total access to the

200
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,180
playboy bunnies,

201
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,370
which needs the club.

202
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,970
A glorified brothel.

203
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,080
Steinem wrote about her experiences and
she was seen as a hero for feminism by

204
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,750
exposing what was going
on behind closed doors.

205
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,111
Now,

206
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:25,651
Hugh Hefner,

207
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:29,580
he took this criticism seriously and
responded by making sure that the women

208
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:30,450
working in his clubs,

209
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,720
they were being treated fairly
and being paid a proper wage.

210
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,980
But as they say,

211
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,660
even bad press is good press.

212
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,550
And despite all of the controversy,

213
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,280
the playboy brand continue to thrive

214
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:47,801
today,

215
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:51,730
it's difficult to imagine playboy and
without the mansion filled with beautiful

216
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,121
girls.

217
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:57,121
But you have not did not by the iconic
house in Los Angeles until 1974 the

218
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,430
mansion sets on five acres
and comes with a movie room,

219
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,570
a massive wine cellar,

220
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,051
a gym,

221
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:02,651
tennis courts,

222
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,720
and even a zoo with exotic animals.

223
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,650
You have not began hosting at some of
the biggest parties in history of the

224
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,190
playboy mansion with celebrity
guests visiting on a regular basis.

225
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,020
He was still the most popular guy around
even well into his old age in the year

226
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:21,610
1980 personally paid for the repair of
the iconic Hollywood sign and the city of

227
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,070
Los Angeles gave him a
star on the celebrity walk,

228
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,600
a thin as a thank you gift.

229
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,020
And the 1980s playboy began
to struggle as a brand.

230
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:31,270
After it became a publicly
shared cooperation,

231
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,190
they were competing with the
likes of Penthouse magazine.

232
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,220
So that peak in popularity was over.

233
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,160
You have now handed control of
the company over to his daughter,

234
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,671
Christie,

235
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,080
who became the new CEO,

236
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,170
have no tried to give normal
domestic life another chance.

237
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,820
And he got married to his second wife,

238
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:46,720
Kimberly Conrad.

239
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,480
In 1989 she gave birth to two sons,

240
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:50,850
Maston and Cuba.

241
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,100
Aaron's.

242
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,610
They got to have a fantasy childhood
growing up in the playboy mansion.

243
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,710
That relationship didn't last though,

244
00:10:56,711 --> 00:11:01,630
and they separated in 1988 and became
officially divorced in 2010 after the

245
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:02,231
separation,

246
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:05,350
you haven't to began to invite his
girlfriend's to live in the house with him

247
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:07,900
and even experimented with bisexuality.

248
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,040
He had a polyamorous lifestyle where he
had multiple girlfriends at one time,

249
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,430
but always had a number
one girl by a site.

250
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,900
He knows you're admitted that he had slept
with roughly 11 out of the 12 monthly

251
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:24,100
playboy cover models in 1999 one if
you happen to his ex girlfriends,

252
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,670
Carrie Lee said that living in the
playboy mansion was almost like a cult

253
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:31,300
because it was so easy to get caught up
in the lifestyle and the drama with the

254
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,350
multiple girlfriends.

255
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,530
She got so caught up in the playboy
lifestyle that she forgot what was

256
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,390
considered normal in the outside world.

257
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,080
However,

258
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,060
unlike a real cults,

259
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,100
the girls living in the house were
free to come and go as they pleased.

260
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,700
They still have that own personal
relationships and kept in touch with their

261
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,450
families.

262
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,260
Some of them even went to college classes
full or part time and their work with

263
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,510
playboy helps them pay for that tuition.

264
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,970
In two and five the reality TV series,

265
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:58,540
girls next door premiered and it gives
people a look into the lives of the

266
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,730
people living and working
in the playboy mansion.

267
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,480
It reveals new Heffernan's new lifestyle
with a team of employees to take care

268
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,440
of all of his needs.

269
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,700
The girls he lived with were also given
an allowance to buy whatever they want

270
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:09,160
it.

271
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,551
Of course,

272
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,820
they are living in the mansion came with
the understanding that Hugh Hefner only

273
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:16,660
at wanted to be involved in an open
relationship where he could sleep with

274
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,530
whoever he wants it,

275
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,900
but the girls were not allowed
to have another friends.

276
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,020
Even though this may seem like
a dream scenario for some men,

277
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,630
the arrangement was not always a
walk in the park for half an hour.

278
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,310
Some of the women who once lived with
him sued him for palimony after that

279
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,800
breakup,

280
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,650
which is like Alan for people
who are living together,

281
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,960
but we were not married
during an interview.

282
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,520
One of half of his ex girlfriends,

283
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,211
Holly Madison,

284
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:41,140
explains that women were competing with
one another for the privilege of being

285
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:42,550
in Hugh Hefner's in a circle,

286
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,390
dozens of small town goals which see
their careers skyrocket after modeling in

287
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,120
playboy and they were desperate
to become a part of it.

288
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,140
Almost every girl who was involved with
the brands moved on to either having a

289
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:56,910
big modeling career or
marrying a millionaire because
I'm having sex with you

290
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:00,550
half know it was a very small price to
pay for guaranteed fame and fortune.

291
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,600
As he got older,

292
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,320
you have no new batter than to expect
any of these young women to be as true

293
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:05,800
love.

294
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,680
He said during an interview with
the New York Times that having seven

295
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:12,970
girlfriends was actually a much easier
lifestyle to manage than having just one

296
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:17,950
wife in 2012 he was 86 years old and
he decided that it was finally time to

297
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,784
settle down.

298
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,200
He married Crystal Harris,

299
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,080
who was just 26 on the reality TV show.

300
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:23,861
Girls next door.

301
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:24,810
He was girlfriends,

302
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,850
showed off their happy lifestyles
living in the playboy mansion,

303
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,200
but Holly Madison came out with a tell
all book in 2015 saying that she had

304
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,890
actually been manipulated into staying
with you half an hour for so many years.

305
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,470
She said that she was truly
in love with him at first,

306
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:42,130
but when she finally got the exclusive
relationship that she was looking for,

307
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,810
she was no longer in love with him.

308
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,500
She eventually married a millionaire
event organizer or Pascal Rotella.

309
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,310
You have to respond to to Madison's
accusations in her book saying it was an

310
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:55,390
attempt to do rewrite history for the
sake of staying relevant in the media and

311
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,980
making money on a book deal.

312
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,830
And 2016 it was clear that he
has in his health was declining,

313
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:11,450
so he decided to sell his mansion in Los
Angeles for $100 million to a man named

314
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,281
Darren Metropole.

315
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:14,300
This in 2018 which are Polis,

316
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:18,020
convinced the city of Los Angeles to add
protections to the house so that it can

317
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:19,040
never be torn down.

318
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,410
The playboy mansion has essentially been
turned into a historical landmark if

319
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,010
you have not died peacefully in September
of 2017 surrounded by his friends and

320
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:30,020
family when he was 91 years old.

321
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,540
Even though he never got
to meet Marilyn Monroe,

322
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,510
he's still accredited her
nudes for all of his success.

323
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,560
This is why he punches the
burial plot right next to hers.

324
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,760
Love him or hate him.

325
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,450
You have no,

326
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,320
it's still an icon that will be
remembered forever before he passed away.

327
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:46,790
He said this about his career.

328
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,410
I've never been in it for the money.

329
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,150
Playboy isn't a business for me.

330
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,130
It has been the very beginning,

331
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,210
a labor of love,

332
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,350
and that's pretty easy to say because
if you don't love all of this,

333
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,783
you're a fool.

334
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,590
