brilliant later in today's video,

00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,870
but if you'd like to learn
more about them right now,

description below.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,670
We're not behind for the annual
prices that he gifted to the welds,

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:19,170
but Alfred Nobel also left us
with another legacy explosives.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,070
He was the inventor of dynamite and
it's even more deadly incarnation.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,490
Jelic night. They made him
rich beyond his wildest dreams,

10
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:30,390
but also left him with a tortured
conscience. In this week's biographics,

11
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:35,391
we examine the life of Alfred
Nobel Alfred Bernard Nobel

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,630
was born on August the 21st
1833 in Stockholm in Sweden.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,860
He was a sickly child.

14
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,950
He almost died after the first
week of his birth as it was.

15
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:58,070
He was one of just four of
eight children to survive.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,640
His illness kept him indoors while
his three brothers played outside.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,060
Alfred's father Emmanuel was an
inventor and he's an engineer,

18
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:08,450
but he struggled to run lines.
His ambitions as a result of the family.

19
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:12,020
It struggled to get by just the three
months prior to Alfred's, his birth,

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,130
his father had been forced to declare
bankruptcy and shut down his business.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,320
Emanuel was now being chased by creditors.

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,160
Things that came almost unbearable when
a fire ravaged the family home tells me

23
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:26,180
against me to the Nobel children web sent
out into the streets to sell matches.

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,180
Alfred was an extremely
pallet and sickly child.

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,240
He suffered from epileptic convulsions
along with a host of gastric diseases and

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,400
debilitating migraine headaches.
For the first six years of his life,

27
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,110
Alfred were schooled by his mother.

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,770
He proved himself to be a gifted student
from the start. By the age of three.

29
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,930
He was able to read from that time onward.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,990
He was rarely seen without
a book in his hand.

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,920
He also had an amazing memory
when Alfred was four years old,

32
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:55,790
his father moved to Russia in order to
pursue a business venture and manual had

33
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,990
managed to get a meeting with the
chairman of the Science Committee for the

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,710
Promotion of Industry and trade.
He steered the conversation
towards lands mines,

35
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:05,030
his area of expertise,

36
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:09,380
and was able to secure an invitation to
Turkey to meet some influential people

37
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,640
and on your worked in Tokyo for two
years where he invented the product.

38
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:16,040
We know today as plywood.
He then moved to Saint Petersburg.

39
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,880
There he was introduced to son Nicholas
the first season that the opportunity

40
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:24,620
and told the czar about his plans to
develop a submerged explosive mine.

41
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,940
Nicholas immediately saw the potential
to use the invention to prevent enemy

42
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,340
ships from entering into Russian waters.

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,323
Okay.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,720
Things are looking up for the Nobels with
the money he received from the Russian

45
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,800
government is compensation
for his developments of the
submerged explosive mine

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,920
and manual setup,

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,440
a mechanical workshop and Armaments
Factory as well as making the new mind.

48
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:56,441
The factory also produced industrial tools
and cannon shells in 1842 when Alfred

49
00:02:56,871 --> 00:03:00,490
was nine years old, manual send for
his family join him from Stockholm.

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,660
The new life of the Nobels was vastly
different to what they're known in Sweden.

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,750
That's and Peter's bag house was luxurious
in comparison to their old home and

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,920
manual was now able to
hire a tutor for his sons.

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,370
Unlike his brother's Alfred
was studious and intellectual.

54
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,400
He was also intensely curious
about the world around him.

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,470
He loved the poetry of Percy Shelley,

56
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,520
especially those concerns with the
subjects of nature and justice.

57
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,440
From these readings, he developed a
deep desire to stand up to injustice.

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,170
Alfred's other loves where
chemistry and languages.

59
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,470
By the time he was 17 he
could speak five languages.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,940
His father also recognized in the by a
natural affinity for solving problems.

61
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:44,080
Marking Alfred is the most promising
of his sons to follow in his inventive

62
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,800
steps.

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,670
The boy loved nothing better than to
spend his time and his father's factory

64
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,000
silently taking in everything that
his dad was doing before long.

65
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,420
His father allowed him to
handle the chemicals himself.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,650
Alfred Street has encouraged his
passion for chemistry and literature.

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,010
At the same time, they coaxed him
to come out of his shell socially,

68
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,180
largely as a result of his l healthy
was a painfully shy and introverted boy.

69
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,620
Yup.
With the help of his tutors.

70
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,680
He began to stretch himself
academically and his mid teens.

71
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,940
He had a gun participating in debate in
clubs and started to share his passions

72
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:16,990
with family members.

73
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,310
Then around the age of 15 he had a growth
spurt which puts him at the height of

74
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,270
most of his peers. This went a
long way to boost his confidence.

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,540
In 1850 Emmanuel paid for
Alfred deep study in Paris.

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,870
He had already been studying with
chemists and Nikolai is in and it was

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,330
chemistry that he pursued in France.

78
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,140
Empower Paris,

79
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,090
offered spend time with Ascanio
subreddit Rowe who had recently invented

80
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:45,930
nitroglycerin.

81
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,070
Breira was totally opposed to any
commercial use of his invention due to its

82
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,250
highly unpredictable explosive potential,
in fact,

83
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,890
in later life and made the following
statements about his invention.

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,790
When I think of all the victims kills
during nitroglycerin explosions and the

85
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,500
terrible havoc that it wreaks,

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,740
which in all probability will
continue to occur in the future.

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,130
I'm almost ashamed to admit
to being it's discover up.

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,930
Sabrina is a version two is discovery
did not put off young. No Bell. In fact,

89
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,920
the reverse history,

90
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,080
the substance fascinated Alfred Nobel
and met a chemist by the name of Jules

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,130
Pelosi,

92
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,470
who was fascinated with nitroglycerin
and had a determination to bring it under

93
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:24,360
control.
After a year in France,

94
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,960
Alfred went into the United States to
pursue his studies that he worked with.

95
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,580
Swedish invented Jon Erickson.

96
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,060
Erickson would go on to gain fame as the
inventor of ironclad warships used in

97
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,650
the civil war, as well as the inventor
of this group. Propeller Erickson,

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,090
Phil's Alfred's minds with dreams of what
he could do if he was able to team the

99
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,510
nitroglycerin. After a year in America,
Alfred returned to some peaches bag.

100
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,540
It's probably recognized
a changed young man.

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,290
His brother Ludvig recalls Alfred
to grown so that I hardly knew him.

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,910
He has almost as tall as I and his voice
has become so deep and strong that I

103
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,050
didn't recognize it, but Alfred
did more than change physically.

104
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,880
The young man who had left with lots
of ideas but little direction now had a

105
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,450
goal to turn nitroglycerin
into a commercially usable
blasting agents for use in

106
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:10,970
tunnels and to create fear,

107
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:15,050
inspiring weapons of war that were so
terrible that nations would be deterred

108
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,750
from ever going to war in the first place.
First though,

109
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,760
Alfred had to come to
the help of the family.

110
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,000
He works alongside his brothers
and one of his father's factories,

111
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,940
but the physical work proved
too much for his weekend body.

112
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,150
He was often too sick to work and on
one occasion in 1854 he became so unwell

113
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,970
that his father passed him off to the
spa town of friends and bad to recuperate

114
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,720
by now in manuals business,
it was flourishing is submerged explosive.

115
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,390
Mine was in high demands
along with other munitions.

116
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,370
Do you supply the Russian
forces in fighting?

117
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:48,371
The Crimean war of 1853 through 1856 by
1853 Emmanuel was employing more than a

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,870
thousand people in his factories and the
Russian government was so pleased with

119
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,800
him that they awarded him the imperial
gold medal in recognition of his

120
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:02,500
diligence and creative skill in Russian
industry in between overseeing years

121
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,950
manufacturing and buyer Emmanuel found
time to collaborate with Alfred on the

122
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,120
nitroglycerin problem,

123
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,010
but even in manual with his vast
experience could not find a safe way to

124
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,240
detonate the substance.

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,300
The ends of the Crimean war in 1856 saw
a sharp downtown in business for the

126
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,890
Nobel Company and I knew what was forced
to change his focus from armaments

127
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,120
productions you shining out
household and industrial implements,

128
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,810
but still the business
suffered by 1859 and manual.

129
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:33,590
Found himself facing bankruptcy for
the second time. He closed the factory,

130
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,910
liquidators his assets and moved with his
wife and youngest son and mill back to

131
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,570
Sweden.

132
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,460
Alfred and his two older brothers loot
Vegan Robert stayed on and some Peter's

133
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,010
bag.

134
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,240
28 year old Ludvig was given the job of
consolidating and running the remnants

135
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,190
of the Nobels Russian operation.

136
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,640
He rebranded the company as the
Ludvig Nobel mechanical factory.

137
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,330
Alfred spends about four hours each day
helping out with the family business the

138
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,200
rest of the day. He worked on his
passion to team Nitroglycerin.

139
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,270
Alfred's first step was to learn to create
nitroglycerin himself by 1861 year to

140
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:14,720
accomplish that goal after spending up
to 18 hours a day in a small factory

141
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,200
building.

142
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,250
The first breakthrough came
when he discovered how to
transport a nitroglycerin

143
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:23,120
safely by first soaking yet and coldest.
Now,

144
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:27,350
suddenly Nitroglycerin was a viable
explosive engineering companies from all

145
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:30,980
over the world came to the Nobel company
to purchase the products and as the

146
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:35,450
money started rolling in Alfred's next
challenge was to find a safe way to

147
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,100
designate the nitroglycerin.

148
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,050
And September of 1864 though tragedy
struck the Swedish Nobel company factory.

149
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,520
A Vat of Nitroglycerin had been overheated
and the resulting explosion five

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,310
people were killed, including
Alfred's younger brother and mill.

151
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,650
Alfred himself was working
in the next building,

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,650
anti suffered minor injuries and the
disaster rather than being pushed off from

153
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,150
working with Nitroglycerin.

154
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,190
Alfred threw himself into making the
explosive safer to give up now would be in

155
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,890
his view to allow his
brother to have died in vain.

156
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,070
In 1865 he built a factory in Hamburg,
Germany.

157
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,670
It's so happens that the soil arounds
the Hamburg factory and we're special.

158
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,670
It's contained.
Minute particles are fossils.

159
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,560
When nitroglycerin was poured into the
style, it turns into a dewy consistency.

160
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,880
This process and affects
puts the Nitroglycerin to
sleep in order to wake it up

161
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:27,270
for detonation purposes.
Nobel bell invented the blasting cap.

162
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,620
Alfred knew that a fuse could not be used
directly to detonate nitroglycerin bus.

163
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,310
That gunpowder could be used to
detonate it a few years could be used to

164
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,370
designate the gunpowder, which would
then ignite the nitric restaurant.

165
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,170
By 1867 he had mastered the use of Small
Cup of capsules of Mercury fulminate,

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,070
which was ignited by a fuse
to detonate the nitroglycerin.

167
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,830
This blasting cap would
wake up the Nitroglycerin,

168
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:52,410
which was packed into a doe soil base,

169
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,150
Nobel calls the combination of
nitroglycerin blasting and soil dynamite,

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,450
Nobel patented dynamite and began
putting it on the commercial market.

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,560
It was an immediate success with engineers
from all over the world clamoring to

172
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:08,550
get their hands on it.
Virtually overnight Alfred became rich.

173
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,680
Beyond his wildest dreams.

174
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,630
We can get an idea of how much
money came in by an anecdote,

175
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,950
apparently true concerning his house
maids wedding when Alfred Asta what she

176
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:29,660
would like as a gift. The various astute
go replied as much as you make in a day.

177
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,763
The following day,

178
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Nobel gave her a check for $100,000
Alfred and self never married,

179
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,650
but he did have at least three
great loves throughout his life.

180
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,950
While living in Russia in his early
twenties he fell for a Russian Gal by the

181
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:45,110
name of Alexandria,
painfully shy.

182
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:49,070
He finally built up the gumption to
tell the girl how he felt about her,

183
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,300
but his affections, what roundly
rejected the rebuff, hurting badly,

184
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:56,870
and for the next 20 years he refused
to let his heart be broken again.

185
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,640
Nobel consciously portrayed
himself as a [inaudible],

186
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,920
an eccentric he wants to
rate the following about
himself. I'm a misanthrope,

187
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:08,480
yet utterly benevolence. Have more than
one screw loose. Yes, I'm a super idea.

188
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:12,230
This two digests philosophy
more efficiently than the food.

189
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,710
Even though he had money to purchase
literally anything he wanted,

190
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,630
Alfred was rather frugal.

191
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,470
This may have been a reflection of the
extreme poverty that he had experienced

192
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,304
in his childhood.

193
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,310
He had no interest in purchasing such
tokens of wealth is elegant carriage

194
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,260
clothing or food,

195
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,980
but would invest liberally in new
estates and business ventures.

196
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,910
Nobel was known to have a temper and he
was a man who did not suffer fools with

197
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,000
many occasions being recorded
where he was rude with people.

198
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,600
Usually those who worked for him, he was
a get to the point type of guy. Yeah.

199
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,230
Do you also have the ability to charm
potential investors when the need

200
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,064
warranted it.

201
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,280
In 1870 Alfred apparently

202
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,030
tired of his life of solitude and placed
an advertisement in the newspaper that

203
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,410
read as follows,
wealthy,

204
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:03,880
highly educated gentleman seeks Lady
of mature age vast in languages as

205
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,280
secretary and supervisor of households.

206
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,200
After interviewing a number of applicants,

207
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,190
Alfred employed a woman by the
name of birth or sky, 33 year olds.

208
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,060
Bertha was extremely attractive and
Nobel was immediately attracted to up.

209
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,310
It was also taken with obvious
intelligence and wit that's birth.

210
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,230
It did not return her
employers a factions. In fact,

211
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:27,280
she already had a fiance or after a few
months probably feeling and that he is

212
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,990
with the situation.
She resigned,

213
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,500
doesn't Nobel's secretary still the two
remained friends and they maintained an

214
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,770
active letter correspondence right
up until the time of Nobels deaf.

215
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,840
She in fact became the recipient of the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1905 some weeks

216
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:43,190
after birth or left his employee,
Nobel Matt,

217
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,130
a young woman by the name of Sophie has,

218
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,510
despite the fact that Alfred was 43 and
Sophie was just 20 they entered into a

219
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,820
relationship.
There was the last for 18 years,

220
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,720
apparently embarrassed by the age gap.
Nobel kept their relationship a secret,

221
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,110
the age difference with not the only
thing that seemed to work against the

222
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,800
relationship.

223
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,760
Sophie was uncouth and educated and
it'll manage their relationship.

224
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,990
It was a toxic one. In 1891 Sophie
became pregnant to another man,

225
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,010
but Alfred held out hope for their
relationship until she married the child's

226
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,290
father. Three years later, even then,

227
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,320
he sent her an annual allowance
of 6,000 Florence Nobel

228
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,400
never had any children.
Despite his immense wealth.
He filled his days with work,

229
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:32,540
often going nonstop for 20 hours.
In 1875 he invented Jelic nights,

230
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,360
which proved to be a safer
explosive than dynamite.

231
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,840
In the late 1860s Alfred's sat up at
number of clients across Europe and the

232
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:39,680
United States.

233
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,820
In June of 1866 he started the
United States blasting Iowa company,

234
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,980
the first nitric company in the US.

235
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,550
He also spend increasing amounts of time
and money protecting his pattern does

236
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:53,600
inventions from fraudsters who tried
to make money off his hard work.

237
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,890
Alfred was convinced that his invention
of dynamite who would ultimately be good

238
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,731
for mankind,

239
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:02,840
saying that my dynamite Walt sooner
lead to peace then a thousand wells

240
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,460
conventions.
As soon as men,

241
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,330
we'll find that in one instant hole
on his can be utterly destroyed.

242
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,570
They surely will abide in golden piece
as history has borne out his faith in

243
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:14,840
mankind.

244
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,620
It was sadly misplaced in 1869 while
traveling in Florence Nobel and that Paul

245
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Barb at graduates of
the echo polytechnique,

246
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,550
Bob who came from an affluent
family was fascinated with no bells,

247
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,170
dynamite and proposed partnership.

248
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,460
He offered to finance the production of
dynamite in France and told me that he

249
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:34,910
wanted to learn how to produce it himself.
He had no bells interest.

250
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:38,450
Mainly because France was envied in the
industry for the state monopoly that had

251
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,130
held over explosives production.

252
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,820
The two men came to an agreement by
which all profits would be split.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,620
50 50 the fringe enterprise was a success
and it soon expanded to factories in

254
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,210
Spain, Switzerland. Ethnicity.

255
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,990
In 18 eight Alfred set his sights on
establishing a dynamite company in

256
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:54,500
England's.

257
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,280
He considered this to be the prime
location as it would open up at the entire

258
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,560
British empire as this new market.

259
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,070
He spent several months traveling around
Britain's mining districts looking for

260
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,240
suitable factory locations. The Best Johns
is for investments came from Scotland.

261
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,680
After much negotiation,

262
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,570
the British dynamite company was formed
in 1871 Alfred purchased a four story

263
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:16,140
mansion and to state in Paris.

264
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,730
What does the Green House for his prize
orchids and stables for his beloved

265
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:23,840
horses, the SDS. It also had a private
laboratory for the next decade.

266
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,380
Alfred spend the bulk of his time working
in this lab along with his assistant.

267
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,790
Was George a Fehrenbach?

268
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,840
It was here that he discovered what he
considered to be dynamite 2.0 Jack Knight.

269
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,540
Jack Ignite was not any
more stable than dynamite.

270
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,250
It calls the greater explosion and was
easier to shape overall the substance.

271
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,070
It was simply much safer and
easier to handle than dynamite.

272
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,380
The new invention was
and even greater success.

273
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:49,370
The dynamites and Dick caused even more
money to flow into the Nobel coffers in

274
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:53,180
1891 now for the grand dissatisfied with
the facilities and as Paris mentioned,

275
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,040
the borrower tree,
he bought another a stage.

276
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,670
This one located some 15 miles from
Paris and the town of sovereign. Yeah,

277
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,830
he builds a larger and
better equipped to lab.

278
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,610
He based himself in the town bus run
into problems with the French authorities

279
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:08,000
when he refused to comply with the
new regulations and policies which he

280
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,960
considered to be unnecessarily
restrictive. Amazing. The,

281
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:13,970
the French government charged
him with high crimes and treason.

282
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,210
He was forced to poses new lab ones.
You left for Italy,

283
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,080
the French government for bade him from
ever working in that country again.

284
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,570
Prior to his asked from France.

285
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,060
Alfred's had been working on his
latest invention Ballis state.

286
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,180
He continued this work.
It isn't new lab in San Reno in Italy.

287
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,560
About that stage was a
smokeless propellants that
combines nitrocellulose since

288
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,840
Nitroglycerin,
the rights to the new explosive.

289
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,430
What leads to the Italian government.

290
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:41,120
He began using the m one
eight nine zero Vasily rifles,

291
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,830
which used cartridges that
were loaded with Balla state.

292
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,990
Alfred's brother Ludvig died in
1888 the newspapers, however,

293
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:57,850
reported that it was the far more famous
Alfred he would pass away. As a result,

294
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:01,790
his Nobel had the rare
experience of reading his own
obituary. What do you read?

295
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,590
It shocked him to his core.

296
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,330
Virtually every newspaper that he looked
at seemed to glory and his suppose

297
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,164
demise.

298
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,700
One French headline announced the merchant
of death is dead and other reports

299
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,470
stated Dr Alfred Nobel,

300
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,280
the Musa later who became rich by finding
ways to kill more people faster than

301
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,110
ever before died yesterday.

302
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,000
Nobel was devastated that the realization
that the end result of his life's work

303
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,620
was to be worldwide condemnation.

304
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,790
He decided that he had to do something
to turn around his reputation and

305
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,350
whatever time you had left.

306
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,910
In 1893 Alfred employed a
personal assistant by the
name of Ragnar Soleman and

307
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,460
appointed him as the executor of his will.

308
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,120
The two men worked diligently on the
documents over the next two years.

309
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,150
Then on November the 27 1895 Alfred signs
the will of the Swedish Club in Paris.

310
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,080
It was a well like no other.
Alfred left 94% of his total wealth,

311
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,890
the equivalent of 265 million,

312
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,900
$2,018 to the awarding of a number of
annual prizes to individuals who according

313
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,700
to the well during the proceeding year,

314
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
have conferred to the
greatest benefit on mankind.

315
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,780
The wills spelled out five categories,
physics, medicine, chemistry,

316
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,340
literature and peace.

317
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,420
The peace prize was to be given to the
person who has done the most or best work

318
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:23,220
for fraternity between the nations and
abolition or reduction of standing armies

319
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,940
into the formation and spreading
of peace congresses. Today,

320
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,980
there is a six category economics,

321
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:31,800
but this was not added until
the end of the 20th century

322
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,980
and his late fifties Nobel's health
was increasingly causing him problems.

323
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,310
His heart was especially weak and
it attempts to self medicated.

324
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:47,710
He began administering
doses of Nitroglycerin.

325
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,250
There's quite likely contributed
to his deteriorating state.

326
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,230
His body finally gave out on December
the 10th 1896 following a stroke.

327
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,180
He was 63 years of age. Nobel prizes
began to be awarded five years later,

328
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,590
the Nobel prize for peace.

329
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,000
So today's video is a great example of
our science can be used for both good and

330
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:10,630
for bad.

331
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,410
And Alfred Nobel is not alone in his
position in history as someone who used

332
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:18,910
science to create something
truly devastating. But if
we cannot understand it,

333
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,210
we cannot hope to control it. And when
it comes to understanding science,

334
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,770
there's really no better place
to do that than it brilliance.

335
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,050
They all relenting platform,

336
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:29,080
which teaches you through
something called active learning.

337
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,170
Basically this means that instead of
staring at some text and complicated

338
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,110
diagrams and equations,
you solve problems actively.

339
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,900
I've been using brilliant to get a feel
of how this works and it's a bit like

340
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:40,960
this I don't know about sitting down when
I was a student looking at a textbook

341
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,080
and reading a paragraph and then
having no idea what really happens.

342
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:47,920
I'd go back over it again and again and
I'm still not really get it or get it a

343
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,560
little. What brilliant has
absolutely none of that.

344
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,390
Each thing you read is immediate.
The applied,

345
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,470
I chose a random topic and brilliant as
an example for this message and in five

346
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:59,320
minutes I understood what vectors,
Skylar's and displacement,

347
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:02,710
where in physics it's pretty crazy because
if those were just written down in a

348
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:04,090
paragraph like I mentioned before,

349
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:07,630
I'd just be like they were the
what now it would make no sense.

350
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,160
This is why brilliant is so great.

351
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,350
If you like learning and I'm going to
guess you all because you're watching a

352
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:14,050
channel like this one,
you will love brilliance.

353
