1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,900
Christopher columbus has become a
controversial historical figure.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,740
I claims for centuries as
the discovery of America.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,663
He wasn't.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,110
He has gains notoriety for the
decimation of the native peoples that he

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,440
encountered obsessed with obtaining goals,

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,780
slaves in order to pay off debt and
impress the king and queen of Spain.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,090
He ended up as an outcast on ones that
in the place that he discovered and sent

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,020
back to Spain in disgrace.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,670
In this week's biographics,

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,600
we're looking at the uncomfortable
truth about Christopher Columbus.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,130
There is no agreed upon date as to when
Christopher Columbus entered into the

12
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:45,610
weld.

13
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,460
Some historians put the
date as early as 1436,

14
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:51,820
but others claim that
it was as late as 1455.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,960
The majority agree though that he was
born sometime between August the 25th and

16
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,180
October 31st in 14,

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,043
51.

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,940
The place of his birth,

19
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:00,160
though.

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,020
That's something we do know for certain.

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,510
It's the Italian coastal city of genuine.

22
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,520
Christopher was the
oldest of five children,

23
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,430
born to Susanna Fontana,

24
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,900
Rossa and Dominica Colombo.

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,290
The name Columbus is an English
derivation of the Italian Colombo.

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,020
Dominica was a weaver and an innkeeper,

27
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,050
but he was also a keen seafarer and his
love of the ocean would soon transfer to

28
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,940
his oldest son as early as age 10,

29
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:29,050
Christopher ranged up and down the
genuine harbor in borrowed single man

30
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:34,051
sailboats and dreams of venturing
out into the vast expanse beyond.

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,910
We know very little about
Christopher's early life,

32
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:40,990
but we do know that his father was able
to provide a modest yet comfortable

33
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:45,160
living for the family and that he was a
kindly involved man who brought his sons

34
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:47,440
up with strong biblical morals.

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,600
We don't even know if young
Christopher went to school.

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,640
It was recorded that he
was a great intellect,

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,020
this listen education,

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,010
and so he may have been illiterate when
he left home at around the age of 20.

39
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,520
Still,

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,080
he overcame his lack of formal education
by teaching himself many valuable

41
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:06,250
skills including matt making functional
mathematics and the range of languages

42
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,420
including Spanish,

43
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,170
Latin,

44
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,220
and Portuguese.

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,020
By the time he sailed to the Americas,

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
he had also learned to read and to write.

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,930
Okay.

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,500
It is generally agreed that Columbus
first went to see at the age of 14,

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,730
he began his Maritime Korea as a messenger
and worked his way up to the position

50
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,860
of common sailor for the next six years.

51
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:33,670
He works in a variety of ships
that plying the European oceans.

52
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,770
A legend has emerged at the age of
21 columbus tried his hand at piracy.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,100
He was in the employee of Duke Renea.

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,650
I've owned Jew who had appointed the young
man to capture a warship in the Tunis

55
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,660
harbor in North Africa on
roots of the men with Columbus,

56
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:50,500
got Tim Ids and persuaded him to
send him back to France and gathered

57
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,400
reinforcements.

58
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,290
The story goes that during the night,

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,070
Columbus played a trick on his men by
altering the ship's compass so that they

60
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:59,200
sailed south instead of north.

61
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,071
When they broke,

62
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,630
they were within sight of the target.

63
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,860
Washington's Columbus managed to
Ronnie as men for a successful attack.

64
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,120
Many scholars dismissed the accounts due
to the fact that Columbus was only 21,

65
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,750
which seems far too young
to be given such a command.

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,050
There's more certainty regarding a
voyage that he took two years later.

67
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,770
The destination was the Greek
islands of kiosks in the Aegean Sea.

68
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,210
He ends the rest of the crew.

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Spent a year on the islands in 1476 at
the age of 25 Columbus first ventured

70
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,870
beyond the realms of the Mediterranean
and into the wider oceans beyond.

71
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,180
He was part of a fleet of five ships,

72
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:39,100
bound for Lisbon in Portugal on route
to the fleet was attacked by a Franco

73
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,190
Portuguese war fleet.

74
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,500
In the ensuing battleships
from both sides,

75
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,420
went down with hundreds of men.

76
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:45,250
Drowning Columbus was on the big hello,

77
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,740
which was struck and
sunk by a French worship.

78
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,330
It was only a stroke of fortune that
ended up saving Christopher's life diving

79
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:52,901
into the sea.

80
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,450
He managed to clean to a
floating or and used it as a boy.

81
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:59,440
He's against the Portuguese shore
at lag Os some six miles away.

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,860
Luckily the people of Lagos took him in
and he's got him back to good health.

83
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,700
He managed to make his way from the to
Lisbon where he joins up with a large

84
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,620
colony of January.

85
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,460
His ship builders,

86
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,250
merchants,

87
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,510
in 1477,

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,520
he joined a voyage to Iceland,

89
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,270
which he described as much
beyond the limit of the West.

90
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,360
We're to Lisbon.

91
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,420
He learns much of the inner
workings of the seafaring trait.

92
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,950
This port city was the center of
seafaring voyage and discovery.

93
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,540
It was the place where stories of what
lay beyond we're told and schemes of

94
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,380
exploration.

95
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,214
Expound it.

96
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,061
During this time,

97
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:39,640
Columbus undertook the study of astronomy,

98
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,563
geography,

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,100
and celestial navigation.

100
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,390
In 1478,

101
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,020
he set off for the three
key Atlantic Archipelagos.

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,780
The first islands greet
visitors were the Azores,

103
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,480
800 miles west of Portugal.

104
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,850
The other two were the Madeira
archipelago and the Canary Islands.

105
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,140
During these voyages,

106
00:04:56,141 --> 00:05:00,280
Columbus gained valuable experience on
the open seat on his return to Lisbon,

107
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,210
Christopher mets,

108
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:05,440
and fell in love with a 25 year old
woman by the name of Phillipa Munez.

109
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,860
Despite being of noble birth and with
family connections to the Portuguese

110
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,460
course,

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,890
Philipa does not come
from a wealthy family.

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,830
When the two were married just a few
months after the courtship began,

113
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,110
her father had no dowery to offer.

114
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,970
The newlyweds settled in the town of
Porto Santo and the Madeira Islands where

115
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,351
Felipe,

116
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:24,590
his father had previously
done the governor in 1480.

117
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,130
A son was born and his name was diego.

118
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,320
Soon after giving birth though died.

119
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,380
The details surrounding
her demise are unclear,

120
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,950
but most historians believe
that the course was tuberculosis

121
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,150
by the age of 30.

122
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:45,750
Christopher Columbus had developed a
great deal of skill and experience as an

123
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,584
ocean voyage.

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,070
He had traveled as far as Iceland to
the northern Ghana to the west still.

125
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,990
He was fascinated with what lay further
out the area beyond the horizon was

126
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:57,120
known as the Green Sea of darkness,

127
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,280
and that was much speculation about
what could be found that Columbus was

128
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,990
convinced the by sailing west,

129
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,090
he would eventually end up in Asia.

130
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,030
This was a novel idea and
before you could test it out,

131
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,920
he needed to gain academic support for
his belief along with his brother bottle,

132
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:13,311
a mayor.

133
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:16,040
He spends months pouring
over geographical maps,

134
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,770
astronomical with books
and other related works.

135
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,380
When you found anything that
supported his hypothesis,

136
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,410
he underlined this and
scribbled it into his notepad.

137
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,121
Columbus.

138
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:29,660
This study led to three key assumptions
upon which he funded his belief.

139
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,321
Firstly,

140
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,870
there was only one ocean,

141
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,601
the Atlantic,

142
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,010
and he believed it to be narrowed.

143
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,580
His second seconds belief was that the
world was relatively small and that Asia

144
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:41,030
was much closer to Europe than
it actually ended up being.

145
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,560
His final assumption was that there was
no large landmass between Europe and

146
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,220
Asia.

147
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,940
In hindsight,

148
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,610
we know that Columbus was
guilty of selective research.

149
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,420
Anything that didn't support his
hypothesis was rejected outright.

150
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,530
He gains much support from the writings
of Marco Polo and first century

151
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,450
cartographer Marianas of tie.

152
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,220
This convinced him that if he sailed u,

153
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,390
s t would reach Asia
in less than 3000 miles

154
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,700
with the scientific backing,

155
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:15,030
but he needed Columbus now set out
to find a backup for his plans,

156
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:18,060
voyage of discovery more
than mere financial support.

157
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:22,680
He was after a Royal Baca who could go
under him the prestige and status that he

158
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:25,770
would earn by such a perilous
journey in his own words.

159
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:29,710
He wanted to be in Zionsville to call
myself dawn and should be high admiral of

160
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:30,181
the ocean,

161
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:30,690
sea,

162
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,320
and device.

163
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,650
Ryan,

164
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,180
governor in perpetuity of all the islands
and the mainland and I discover and

165
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,110
gain all the termites thereafter be
discovered and gains in the ocean sea,

166
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,430
and so that's my eldest son should
succeed me and his as then forth from

167
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,010
generation to generation forever
and ever in return for such honors,

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,090
Columbus would bestow the riches of Asia.

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,020
Upon these sponsoring sovereign tobacco
is course he quoted from the journals of

170
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:59,730
Marco Polo about the riches of the orients
having lived in Portugal for the past

171
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,270
eight years.

172
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,260
It was only natural that his first
request was made to that country's king,

173
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,730
but despite his persuasiveness,

174
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:06,930
Columbus is proposal,

175
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,883
it was rejected.

176
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,660
The king viewed this unproved.

177
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:13,620
Sander is being vain and conceited
and rather parental bragging.

178
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,750
The fact that in addition to the owners,

179
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:20,460
Columbus also demanded one 10th of all
income derived did not help his course.

180
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,200
Even beyond all that,

181
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,710
the vast majority of the king's advisors
believed that the plans are reached.

182
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:30,711
The Orient by sailing west was nothing
more than a fool's errands with a round

183
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:32,490
rejection from his adopted country.

184
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:36,840
Columbus set his sights on the king of
Spain by now the would be adventure.

185
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,550
I was 34 years of age,

186
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,240
penniless,

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,810
widowed,

188
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,230
and with a young son to care for
arriving in these Spanish port town of

189
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,000
panelists with five-year-old Diego,

190
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:49,590
and so he first attempt to find food
lodging and a place for the ato to stay as

191
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:51,420
his father made his approach to the king,

192
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,400
Columbus made his way to a Franciscan
monastery overlooking the pleaded poverty

193
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,600
for the next five months.

194
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,260
This monastery would be as base
then towards the end of 1945,

195
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:06,240
he made his way to court data to seek an
audience with King Ferdinand and Queen

196
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,380
Isabella.

197
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,390
He had to wait for the to return
from Madrid and during this time,

198
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,700
that's a young woman named
Beatrice on request to Herana.

199
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,870
She began his mistress giving
birth to his second son,

200
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,730
Ferdinand's on August the 15th,

201
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,390
14,

202
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,110
88.

203
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,920
The audience before the King and
Queen was granted on May the first 14,

204
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,843
86.

205
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,800
Columbus and Isabella develops and
immediate bonds being of the same age and

206
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,760
clearly they were like minded still.

207
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:32,700
The monarchs turn the idea
over to an investigator,

208
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,590
Columbus would have to wait for five
and a half frustrating years to learn of

209
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,480
their final decision during that time.

210
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,320
He had returned to Lisbon in an attempt
to reopen negotiations with the king

211
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:43,850
there,

212
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,360
but all to no avail.

213
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,030
In the end of the Spanish
commission also rejected the plan,

214
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,510
their main reasons for doing so whether
the voyage to Asia would require an

215
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:53,010
absence of three years.

216
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,940
This was far too long with the available
technology and it's the belief that if

217
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,490
a ship did manage to get to
the other side of the world,

218
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,210
there was no way that it would be
able to get back the final decision.

219
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,601
However,

220
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,360
it was left to King
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.

221
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,560
The king was happy to go along with the
commission's recommendation after all he

222
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,540
disliked Columbus on the personal level.

223
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,170
The queen,

224
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:13,710
however,

225
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,330
took pains to reassure Columbus that he
would be able to resubmit his plan in

226
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:18,960
the future.

227
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,710
The Spanish struggle against the most
at this point had been going on for 700

228
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:27,360
years and it was nearly at a conclusion
when this was decided the queen and told

229
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,820
him he would get a better reception.

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,280
On January the second 14,

231
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,741
92,

232
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,410
the Morrish city of Granada
fell to the Spanish.

233
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,370
Shortly thereafter,

234
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,080
the Royal Minister of the budget,

235
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:41,310
he was friendly with Columbus and trusted
about mcqueen to show favor to the

236
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:42,270
mariners scheme.

237
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,040
She relented in Columbus,

238
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,040
who was down on his way back to
Cordova or on the back of a mule,

239
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,540
was intercepted and rushed to the
royal palace to receive the good news.

240
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,160
After waiting for five years,

241
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:02,180
it took Columbus just 10 weeks to gather
together the three ships crew and the

242
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,260
supplies that he needed.

243
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,041
His three ships,

244
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:04,191
they,

245
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:05,630
Nina pins are in Santa Maria,

246
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,440
were skillfully built and according to
him were well suited for the task at

247
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:09,950
hands.

248
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,800
Columbus gathered a group of 19 men
to be split between the three ships.

249
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,920
The fleet left early
morning on August the third,

250
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:16,350
14,

251
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,060
92.

252
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,210
The first stop was the Canary
Islands thousand miles to the south.

253
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,860
Then the ships were refitted
and resupplied before
heading out into the Green

254
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,700
Sea of darkness.

255
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,290
The ship's made good progress,

256
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,930
thanks to strong easterly
winds off to some days.

257
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:33,470
They entered into an area
known as the Saragossa Sea.

258
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,750
All around the waters
were filled with Gulf.

259
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:39,530
We're to thick green plants that are
floated on the surface at the same time as

260
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,191
this was happening,

261
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,380
the wind's died down to almost nothing.

262
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,580
After three weeks at sea,

263
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:44,530
the cre begins aside,

264
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,950
land nesting birds.

265
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,520
Still.

266
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,960
There was no citing of lands.

267
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,010
As the weeks passed,

268
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,780
with no indications of Terra Firma,

269
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,610
the creek became increasingly
agitated onboard the Santa Maria.

270
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,960
They were using close to musiny.

271
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,890
We things coming to a boiling point is
Columbus made an ultimate declaration on

272
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,790
October the 10th.

273
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,830
If land was not cited in three days,

274
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,740
he promised that he would
turn back two days later.

275
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,560
The long awaited word came
at 2:00 AM on the twelfth,

276
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,820
the cry of Tara,

277
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,890
Tara resounded from ship to ship.

278
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,820
Ninety pairs of eyes strained to see
the islands that was six miles in the

279
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:16,654
distance.

280
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,050
Columbus promised that the first man
to site land would receive a yearly

281
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:20,530
pension,

282
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,350
have a thousand married aviators
for the rest of his life.

283
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,980
Yes.

284
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,370
That's and to say the name is
Rodrigo ever received this reward.

285
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,570
Columbus claims do have seen a line to
the evening before and gave himself the

286
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,430
reward that come across in Ireland,

287
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,090
situated in the middle of the Caribbean.

288
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,990
Seed it was populated by are like Indians.

289
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,470
These were a friendly people and some
of them swung out to meet the new

290
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:41,980
comments.

291
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,000
These people lived in village communes
and to develops an agricultural economy.

292
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,740
They have no iron implements,

293
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:51,700
but Columbus was quick to notice that
they wore tiny pieces of goals in memory

294
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,930
is Columbus,

295
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,870
was determined to get to the
source of the Arawaks gold.

296
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,770
He at some of the natives of borders
ships and then took them as prisoners.

297
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,790
He demanded that they guide into the
place why the gold was located not having

298
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,040
success in sales to modern day Cuba,

299
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,650
and then to Hispaniola it was that,

300
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,080
that his visions of a vast gold empire.

301
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,321
Well,

302
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,154
rekindles,

303
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,430
when a local chief presented
him with a gold mask,

304
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,660
Columbus and his men build a
force on the island of Hispaniola.

305
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,920
Naming is another dad.

306
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,813
Christmas.

307
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,850
He left 39 men that with
strict orders to find the gold.

308
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,420
He then took more prisoners and began
for the return journey to Spain before

309
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:36,470
leaving his men killed two natives who
refuse to trade as many bows and arrows

310
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,000
as they demand is on the return.

311
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,361
Jenny,

312
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:41,030
some of the prisoners died
from exposure to cold weather.

313
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,260
What is the return to Spain?

314
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:45,380
Columbus made extravagant claims
about what he had encountered.

315
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,280
He stated that he had reached Asia
when in fact he had landed on Cuba.

316
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,690
He also spoke of rivers flowing with
golden's and abundance of spices.

317
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,050
He promised that with a little more
financial help from the king and Queen,

318
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,670
you could go back and pick up as much
gold as they needed and as many slaves as

319
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:02,504
they need it to.

320
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,850
The king and queen were
suitably and damage.

321
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:09,170
The second voyage was made up of
17 ships in more than 1,200 men.

322
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,140
Whereas the first trip had
been focused on reaching Asia.

323
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,180
Now the objective was twofold,

324
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,730
slaves and gold from islands,

325
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,211
islands.

326
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:21,280
They raged taking prisoners and demanding
that they be led to the goals as word

327
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,760
spreads of the impending danger.

328
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,690
Villages were evacuated and the sailors
who had been left at Nafa dabs were

329
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,550
executed with no goal to be found.

330
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,710
Columbus embarked upon
a massive slave drive,

331
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,420
$1,500,

332
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,051
proac men,

333
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:37,730
women and children with thrown into pens
and from them 500 of the best specimens

334
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:39,560
were chosen to be taken to Spain.

335
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,420
200 of these died on the way back with
the remainder being sold at auction.

336
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,920
Still Columbus was desperate to get
his hands on the goals in Haiti.

337
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:53,720
He ordered that every person aged 14 or
over was to collect a minimum quota of

338
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,370
goals every three months.

339
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,010
Those that succeeded were
given a capa necklace to app.

340
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,010
Anyone without the nexus
would have to hand cut off.

341
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,370
The reality was though there was hardly
any gold to be hands apart from small

342
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,260
amounts that can be found in streams.

343
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
The results of Columbus as gold
obsession was that in two years,

344
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,441
the black population was cut in half
with a hundred and 25,000 people being

345
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:15,920
murdered,

346
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,880
starve to death,

347
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,380
or committing suicide.

348
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,430
Columbus established his
base on Hispaniola and named
himself governor of the

349
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:22,970
islands.

350
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,950
The situation quickly devolved into chaos,

351
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,710
though most of the Europeans
on the islands were seconds.

352
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,570
Many of them were ex convicts.

353
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,440
They occupied themselves by raping the
native women and terrorizing the men and

354
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,010
children.

355
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,090
Looting was rampant and the quantity of
goals gathered was pitiful compared to

356
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,500
what Columbus promised.

357
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,790
In October of $14,

358
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,331
95,

359
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:45,680
a royal inspector arrived on Hispaniola
in the wake of worrying reports that had

360
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,000
reached the Spanish court.

361
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,480
The inspector soon gathered plenty
of evidence to indicate Columbus,

362
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:55,040
giving him no choice but to return to
Spain in order to defend himself before

363
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,000
the king and queen

364
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,360
setting sail on the Nina,

365
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,390
the 45 year old Columbus
arrived back in Portugal.

366
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:06,290
On June the 11th,

367
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,920
14,

368
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,760
46.

369
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,900
He clothed himself in a fry's robe as
a sign of Penitence and set out to meet

370
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,340
the solver writtens that Vegas,

371
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:17,150
which was some 500 miles from his
landing port or meeting the King Queen.

372
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,900
He immediately reassured them there
was still plenty of gold to be hats.

373
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,680
He also tried to convince them that
he had reached the Malay Peninsula of

374
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,290
Southeast Asia as a final enticements.

375
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,040
He told them on x that he was convinced
that there was a whole new continent

376
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,250
lying just to the south of the
islands that he had landed on.

377
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,900
To his surprise and great pleasure.

378
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,570
The king and queen were willing
to overlook the bad reports.

379
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,920
Dad received further.

380
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:44,330
They agreed to finance another voyage
specifically to confirm the existence of

381
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,470
this new continents.

382
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,010
However,

383
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,090
Columbus would have to wait a further
two years before adventuring again.

384
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,960
This time the sufferns insisted that
he take with him colonists rather than

385
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:54,650
soldiers.

386
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,050
The third voyage therefore
included 30 women,

387
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,913
50 farmers,

388
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,880
20 mechanics,

389
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:01,850
and 10 gardeners along with 30 sailors.

390
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,710
The fleet consisted of six ships,

391
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:06,020
which Columbus splits into
two separate commands.

392
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,350
The first three ships had to Hispaniola
with suppliers for the colony that was

393
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:09,801
located,

394
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:13,640
that the reigning ships made onfi
discovery fleet with Columbus at the helm.

395
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,450
They took a southerly routes to the
indies and such have any lands lying south

396
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,440
of the Antilles.

397
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,400
Throughout this voyage,

398
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,290
Columbus suffered from terrible pains,

399
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,651
gout,

400
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:22,520
as well as fever.

401
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,010
Land was first sighted
on July the 31st 14,

402
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:25,521
98,

403
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:28,730
and the fleet soon made in
Trinidad for the next two weeks.

404
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,860
They explored the area between Trinidad
and the South American mainland sailing

405
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,501
further west,

406
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,580
they sold lands again,

407
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:39,050
and it was at this point the Columbus
declared they had found the new continent

408
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,540
having achieved his objective.

409
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,670
Columbus set the fleet North Hispaniola.

410
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,720
When he arrived,

411
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,430
he found place in the state of rebellion.

412
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,061
While he was gone,

413
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,280
many of his men had died
mainly from starvation.

414
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,910
While those who survived were disgusted
at the harsh treatments that had been

415
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,690
subjected to under the nominal
rulership of Columbus's.

416
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,300
Brother Bartholomew Bartholomew was
the acting governor while Columbus,

417
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,050
who's away.

418
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,310
The rebels were led by a man named Roden
gathering both standards and natives to

419
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:08,781
his cause.

420
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:11,700
He set about the process of
overthrowing the franchise governments.

421
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:15,570
This Columbus had established after a
period of fierce fighting the exhausted

422
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,321
and physically ill,

423
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:20,550
columbus and treated with Roldan for
peace terms Columbus gave in to all of

424
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,420
Roland's demands,

425
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:25,530
including appointing him as mayor in
giving land grants to every standard who

426
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:28,560
wished to stay on the islands
with this humiliating defeat.

427
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,630
Columbus is only designed now,

428
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,643
was to leave.

429
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,280
Meanwhile,

430
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,740
news of the latest rebellion
had made his way to Spain.

431
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,860
The king had sent a man by the
name of Francisco Dibaba dealer.

432
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,200
They seven of the crown and a night.

433
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,960
His mission was to sort
the entire situation out.

434
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,800
He arrived in Hispaniola to discover
that a mass execution of the rebels was

435
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,990
underway just playing his rod loaders.

436
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:50,490
You put a halt to the proceedings in town,

437
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,031
Columbus,

438
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:53,550
and just to your brothers
thrown into ions.

439
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,740
The three brothers were
shipped back to Spain.

440
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,120
When the people there saw the greater
columbus in chains after the ship darker,

441
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,300
they became angry.

442
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,890
Hearing of this popular reaction,

443
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,510
the king ordered that they'd be freed.

444
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,710
Columbus has reunion with the king and
Queen was an emotionally charged a fap.

445
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,670
He threw himself at the queen's feats
and through solves Kista hands and feets.

446
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,440
He pleaded innocent saying this,

447
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,790
any wrongs he had committed,

448
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,670
whether the result of
ignorance and not wickedness.

449
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,880
This O'Brien's took pity on him and
his promise to restore his wealth and

450
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:26,570
titles.

451
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:26,901
The king,

452
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:27,300
however,

453
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,420
was convinced that while
he may be superior at see,

454
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,390
Columbus was no governor of men on lance
still his skills as a voyager where an

455
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,420
asset that could be further
utilized and as a result,

456
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:42,620
Ferdinand authorized a fourth voyage to
the West indies in the hopes of finding

457
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,630
a direct route to Asia.

458
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,260
However,

459
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,270
he was ordered to stay
well away from Hispaniola.

460
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,380
This time it was strictly
a voyage of discovery.

461
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,310
Columbus set forth on this final voyage
on May the nine slash 15 slash two is

462
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:56,480
fleet reached the West indies.

463
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:57,440
In 21 days,

464
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,303
two weeks later,

465
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,730
his three ships encountered a terrible
storm which they managed to see through

466
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,320
with no loss of life.

467
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,180
The fleet eventually reached
the offshore islands of Banana,

468
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,970
a few miles from Honduras,

469
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,461
from them,

470
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:11,690
they encountered terrible see
conditions for 38 straight days,

471
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,840
which tested the men
to the absolute limits.

472
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,321
Finally,

473
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:17,450
they found their way to
the Panamanian coastline.

474
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,450
Here they were heartened
to find goals in abundance.

475
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,230
They spend the next several months
traveling up and down the coast,

476
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,103
gathering gold,

477
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,630
and then they headed back for Hispaniola,

478
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,850
but the weather beaten and he's in ships.

479
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,610
They never reached Hispaniola
with the ship's taking on water.

480
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,770
They barely limps into Jamaica.

481
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,620
The ships went now,

482
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,660
useless in the party,

483
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:37,580
remained stranded for only a year.

484
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,720
I need to be rescued.

485
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,820
When two ships arrived from Santa Domingo,

486
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,990
Columbus and his men were taken to
Hispaniola to recover from that ordeal,

487
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,500
but the former governor
knew that he was not there.

488
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,730
As soon as he could manage it,

489
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,840
he found a passage on a ship bound for
Spain and arrived back on November the

490
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:53,430
seventh,

491
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,800
15.

492
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:53,960
Oh,

493
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,793
four.

494
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,250
Columbus returned to Spain,

495
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,850
sick,

496
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,420
broken,

497
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,253
and distance.

498
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,410
He was so ill that he could
hardly stand on his own power.

499
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,010
However,

500
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,210
he still had the stamina to demands an
accounting of as accumulated possessions,

501
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,540
your agreements that he had made years
ago with Ferdinand and Isabella for a

502
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,520
10th of all bouncy.

503
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,350
I'd made him a rich man
and now sort the claimants.

504
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,161
As a result,

505
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:22,010
gold was shipped to him and he
was given land in Hispaniola.

506
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,953
Got The wealth.

507
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,020
It came too late for Columbus
to enjoy it in May of 15.

508
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,170
Oh,

509
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,931
six is bad.

510
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:27,980
Health deteriorated.

511
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:28,700
Fatally.

512
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,920
He became bedridden and on May the 19th,

513
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,230
the priest was called to
administer the last rites.

514
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,270
He died the next day.

515
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,620
Moments after whispering in your hands,

516
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:37,190
Lord,

517
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,750
I command my spirit.

518
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,060
It was 54 years of age,

519
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,860
so I really hope you enjoyed that video.

520
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:43,221
If you did,

521
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:46,670
don't forget to subscribe to this channel
for brand new biographies every Monday

522
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,050
and every Thursday.

523
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,561
Also,

524
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,060
I've got another channel
that's called today.

525
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:52,100
I found out it's sort of like biographics,

526
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:54,170
but way more broad on that channel.

527
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:58,040
We get deep into all of the details
on all sorts of interesting stuff.

528
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,560
Check it out through the
link on the screen now,

529
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:02,600
but if you look for something
else to watch right now,

530
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,470
why not check out a biography from the
archives or two that are found out video

531
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,840
over there on the rice and as always,

532
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,100
thank you for watching.
