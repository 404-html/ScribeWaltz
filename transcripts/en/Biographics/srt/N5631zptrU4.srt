00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,000
North Korea is a country
shrouded in mystery.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,690
They do not allow their citizens to
leave and they cannot receive information

6
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:21,890
from the outside world.

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,930
The very few people who are allowed inside
or under strict supervision from the

8
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:29,690
perspective of the United
States and the rest of the West.

9
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:34,691
We see Kim Jong Un as a communist leader
who is threatening nuclear war and

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,440
violating human rights,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,340
and we also see them as someone who's
had a hand in a number of assassinations

12
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,120
of his enemies.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,953
For some people,

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,400
that's all they need to know to form an
opinion and they imagine that he is an

15
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,800
evil dictator or on par
with that of Hitler.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,300
But the truth about this man,

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,160
it's far more complicated.

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,500
Before we get into the
details of Kim Jong,

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,780
it's important to understand a little
bit of history about North Korea.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,793
During World War Two,

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Japan was occupying Korea and the country
fell into a state of extreme poverty.

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,750
They became independent again in 1945,

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,510
but the country was now a rock bottom.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,410
It was extremely difficult to raise
the economy out of the depression,

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,290
especially since they were years
behind the western world in terms of

26
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,940
manufacturing and transportation.

27
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,560
This desperate time made some citizens
open to the ideas of communism where the

28
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,840
government is responsible
for providing food,

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,470
shelter,

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,120
and employment to its citizens.

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,013
The USSR,

32
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,010
it was eager to help,

33
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:46,240
so Russia provided weapons to North
Korea and it split off from the south.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,650
In 1948,

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,720
the leader was a man called Kim.

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,800
Il Sung.

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,760
In the beginning,

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,560
things were actually going quite well.

39
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,150
Kim Molson kept his promises.

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,120
He improved agriculture and
no one was hungry anymore.

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,110
He brought industrialism to the
country which gave the citizens jobs.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,250
They built up the capital
city of Pyongyang and the
country was progressing very

43
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:06,790
quickly.

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,271
For years.

45
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:10,750
North Korea was actually a head
of South Korea in progress.

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,770
People loved him.

47
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,310
Nelson,

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:12,581
in fact,

49
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,510
they loved him so much.

50
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:17,740
They called him the supreme leader and
began making up legends that he was a

51
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:20,080
guard with supernatural abilities,

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,280
but in 1950,

53
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,900
the Korean War began and the USSR and
China teamed up with North Korea and their

54
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,610
attempts to take over the south.

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,840
The United States fought on the side of
democracy and so they helped South Korea

56
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,190
win back their territory.

57
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,750
American soldiers are still stationed
at the border to this very day,

58
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:41,830
even though the war was nearly 70 years
ago in the North Korean version of

59
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:42,221
history,

60
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:45,580
America attacked first and they
were just defending themselves.

61
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,400
This trick of years of NZ,

62
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,410
American propaganda runs a ban on all
American made products and the feeling is

63
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,680
definitely mutual.

64
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,150
The United Nations creative
trade embargoes against
North Korea and refuse to

65
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,010
work with any communist nation.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,670
After the collapse of the
USSR in 1991 North Korea,

67
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,230
it ran out of money and triggered a
widespread famine where citizens were,

68
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:08,920
once again,

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,890
starving people struggled to survive.

70
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,630
This was no longer the utopia that Kim
Il Sung had envisioned into son Kim Jong.

71
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,020
Il was doing very little to
fix anything during his reign.

72
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,891
If anything,

73
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,210
he exploited his power to the fullest
extent and did things that were truly

74
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,691
evil,

75
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:28,330
which only made North Korea as reputation.

76
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,380
Even worse,

77
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,920
Kim Jong Il had several children
with multiple mistresses,

78
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,160
at least three sons and two
daughters are known to the public.

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,230
Kim Dragoon was his third son,

80
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,460
born in 1983,

81
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,520
so it's almost was one of the few neutral
countries that were willing to work

82
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,050
with North Korean diplomats.

83
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,850
Therefore Kim Jong Il centers,

84
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,020
children to boarding school.

85
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,630
That boom was given the alias of pack on.

86
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,590
He got to experience a normal childhood
living in an apartment with a family who

87
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,820
worked at the Swiss embassy.

88
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,370
He was given lessons
on how to speak German,

89
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,150
but he had to enter a class of students
who were two years younger than him in

90
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,890
order to catch up on the reading level.

91
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,840
At first he struggled,

92
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,720
but he was eventually able to make
good friends with the other children.

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,830
His teachers say that he enjoyed playing
game boy and his favorite sport was

94
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,550
basketball.

95
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,630
He was an average students who enjoy gym
class far more than academic subjects.

96
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,050
He wore different in like tracksuits
every single day to school at home.

97
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,080
He loved watching the NBA
and American action movies.

98
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,110
His mother was one of
Kim Jong Il's mistresses,

99
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,850
an opera singer named Koh young here.

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,900
She would fly back and forth from North
Korea on a private jet in order to visit

101
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:32,140
him,

102
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,300
sometimes staying for
several weeks at a time.

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,170
It was able to visit several countries
in Europe and Japan and spent most of his

104
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,110
young life learning about the
world outside of North Korea.

105
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,430
When he was 17 years old,

106
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:45,520
he was taking high school classes
and preparing for graduation.

107
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,320
One day pack didn't come to class and
everyone assumes that he was out sick,

108
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,770
but days turned into weeks
and he never came back.

109
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,330
He was ordered to leave,

110
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,720
so suddenly that he never even
got to say goodbye to his friends.

111
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,630
He had begun taking college
classes in North Korea.

112
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,680
He was never allowed to tell anyone about
the secrets of the outside world since

113
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,060
the entire nation was still living like
it was frozen and some sort of time

114
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,740
capsule from the 19 sixties.

115
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,693
His older brother,

116
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,600
Kim Jong Nam,

117
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,810
was originally supposed to become
the new leader of North Korea.

118
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,310
The second son surely is described as
being very feminist and not appropriate

119
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,360
for a fierce leader.

120
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,810
Boone was third in line for successions,

121
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,720
so growing up he never really expected
to take on that responsibility.

122
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,350
However,

123
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,190
the eldest brother,

124
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,820
man,

125
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,200
he got himself into a lot of trouble
in 2001 now and was caught using fake

126
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:39,520
passports while trying to take his family
to Tokyo Disneyland and they got all

127
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,354
over the news.

128
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,320
His carelessness made members of the
North Korean elites lose trust in his

129
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,970
abilities for the next two years.

130
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,810
Now I'm would openly criticize the way
his father was running the country in

131
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,680
2003.

132
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,150
He was exiled from North Korea and 20
year old who was told that his older

133
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,410
brother was gone.

134
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,240
He would need to become
the next supreme leader.

135
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,630
When Kim Jong Il had his first
stroke and was 25 years old,

136
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,260
his advisors knew that it was time to
begin teaching him how to become the new

137
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:06,840
leader.

138
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,170
Ivr,

139
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,260
when his father died in 2011,

140
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,680
only had only had about a year of
political training at this point,

141
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,000
but it was too late.

142
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,290
At 26 years old,

143
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:20,291
he became the dictator of North Korea
once he was revealed to the nation as

144
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,920
their new supreme leader.

145
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,470
People are skeptical about his young age,

146
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,360
but they also loved him right away.

147
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,480
He was very friendly and mild manners,

148
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:31,910
and he reminded me a lot of people
have his beloved grandfather,

149
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,803
Kim Il Sung,

150
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,210
the superstitious Korean
people began to remove.

151
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:39,680
It was actually a reincarnation of his
grandfather who had come back from the

152
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:43,160
dead in order to bring North
Korea back to it's former glory.

153
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,120
There are very few living
people and outside of North
Korea who knew Kim Jong Un

154
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,840
well enough to be able to
testify for his character.

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,290
Kenji Fujimoto is a chef from Japan who
was hired by Kim [inaudible] to cook his

156
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:05,790
meals and they became good friends after
unwritten time for studying abroad.

157
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,720
What'd you motor was one of the very few
people who he could talk to you openly

158
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,040
about the outside wells.

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,030
He marveled at the fact
that foreign grocery stores
were always filled with food

160
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,530
in North Korea and were always empty
or knew that there was something deeply

161
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:22,110
wrong with this country and
he wanted to make it better.

162
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,000
He can find it in Fujimoto this,

163
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,500
when he became the new leader,

164
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,480
you plan to model North Korea's economy
after China whose wealth and boomed from

165
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:35,090
that production and worldwide distribution
in 2012 when he gave his first speech

166
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:35,924
is the new leader,

167
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,780
Kim Jong UN declared that this
would be a new North Korea,

168
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,910
and all the struggles were behind them.

169
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,590
When he came into power children,

170
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,570
they were still dying of malnutrition.

171
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:49,380
In this first mission was to make sure
that his people had enough to eat.

172
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,790
He spoke about his immense respect for
the loyalty of his people and how they

173
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,350
deserved so much better.

174
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,060
He says,

175
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,880
all people should never have
to tighten their belts again.

176
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,991
From day one.

177
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,350
Kim Jong UN has made an effort to
be the polar opposite of his father,

178
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:04,951
Kim Jong.

179
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,750
Il never made a single public speech.

180
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,040
During the course of his reign,

181
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,820
he kept US citizens out of the loop
and completely avoided interacting with

182
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:12,090
them.

183
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,110
His father and his friends in the
elite class enjoyed a life of luxury.

184
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,920
Any help from charities from the
outside world went to feeding the rich.

185
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:24,300
While baby's continued to die
of starvation every single day,

186
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,050
[inaudible] hats undo decades
of damage done by his father.

187
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,160
It would take time,

188
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,570
but he kept his word.

189
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm going to set out new economic and
agricultural reforms that brought more

190
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:36,840
food to the people within a year or two.

191
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,510
People are healthy again and was a young,

192
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,840
possibly naive man with
big hopes and big dreams.

193
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:46,200
He truly did want to use his position
of power to fix this country,

194
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,830
but he would soon find out so this
even in the position of supreme leader,

195
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,450
some problems are far too complicated
for a single password to fix.

196
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,310
Before Kim Jong Un came to power,

197
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:06,720
generals were national heroes and they
were all a part of an elite class in

198
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,554
North Korea.

199
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,320
A lot of the power in government
was with these military leaders.

200
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,190
Many people don't realize that North
Koreans call their country the DPRK,

201
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,340
which stands the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea,

202
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,080
but the People's Republic was clearly
lacking the funding and power that it

203
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:22,620
needed.

204
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,580
One of Kim Jong Young's first executive
decisions was to remove all of the power

205
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,150
from the military and give some
of it back to the people and their

206
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:31,050
representatives.

207
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,910
His Uncle Jang song fake
was a decorated general,

208
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:38,450
so this executive order stripped away
much of his political power before Kim

209
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:38,940
Jong Il died.

210
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,990
There was some speculation that Jang Song
Faq would become the new leader of the

211
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,940
country since we're still so young.

212
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,650
For the first year of his reign,

213
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,610
Jenkinson Faq offered his nephew some
guidance in how to run the governments,

214
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,030
but it was clear that he was just
trying to be a puppet master.

215
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,200
This one lasted for about a year and 2013.

216
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,400
Kim Jong UN ordered the
execution of his uncle.

217
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,730
He was shot by a firing squad in the past,

218
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:05,130
whenever there was a sudden
death of a member of the elite.

219
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,140
Everyone knew that it was an execution,

220
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:11,310
but the government would explain it away
by saying it was a car accident or a

221
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,110
heart attack or something like that.

222
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,960
Kim Jong UN shock to the
public by saying that yes,

223
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,410
he was the one who had had his uncle
killed because his uncle was trying to

224
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:23,310
overthrow him and take the position
of supreme leader for himself in North

225
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,370
Korea.

226
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,440
If someone commits a serious crime
that are only really three options,

227
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740
send them to a prison camp,

228
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,570
kill them or exiled them.

229
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,370
Considering how much power Jenksen Faq
had the North Korean military killing him

230
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,850
with.

231
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,300
Really the only option Kim Jong them
or say kills many of the men who were

232
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,080
helping his uncle plan the queue for
the other military leaders running the

233
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:43,650
government,

234
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,270
Kim Jong Un forced them into retirements
and replace them with people that he

235
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,860
knew he could trust.

236
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,820
It was later revealed in the international
press that his uncle was a pedophile

237
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,540
and he had an arrangement with Kim
Jong Il when he was still alive.

238
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,970
They targeted extremely young girls.

239
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:03,270
He would audition to be a
part of some artistic role.

240
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,310
I need to become his play things.

241
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,550
He had these young girls
bathe his naked body daily.

242
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,550
Basically why we're not
trying to promote murder,

243
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,690
killing Jameson Faq with a firing
squad was letting him off easy.

244
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:19,290
You can get to what inmates would have
done to him in the US prison system.

245
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,130
However,

246
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,930
the western media latched onto this
story saying he went on a killing spree.

247
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,500
This was also very shocking
for North Korean citizens do.

248
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:28,771
Yeah,

249
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,430
because they are a culture that
deeply respect their elders.

250
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:38,851
Well,

251
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:41,970
North Korea is still very
sheltered from the outside world.

252
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,570
Kim Jong UN has actually
made a lot of efforts.

253
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:48,240
You slowly incorporate
modern life into the DPRK.

254
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,040
He has invited in groups from around the
world to entertain and teach people in

255
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,590
things that that never seen before.

256
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,120
Like a group called SAF,

257
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:55,954
North Korea.

258
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,560
However,

259
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,700
these are special privileges that
are reserved for the elite class.

260
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,650
It has also allowed North
Koreans access to smartphones,

261
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,390
computers,

262
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,160
and hd televisions.

263
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,010
Students are also learning
computer programming in university.

264
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,461
However,

265
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:13,030
they cannot get access to the worldwide
web and there's only one TV channel and

266
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,650
that's used for state propaganda.

267
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,101
Also,

268
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,760
those phones can only make calls
locally and all of this is still only

269
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:20,770
affordable for people in the upper class.

270
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,210
Kim Jong UN began sending his country's
current and future leaders to schools in

271
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,870
Singapore,

272
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,410
Vietnam,

273
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,400
Canada runs Hong Kong in order to receive
a proper education and economics and

274
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,234
politics.

275
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,230
He hopes that they will return with a
better understanding on how to change the

276
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:39,520
North Korean governments
and help transition their
economy into a free market.

277
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,720
Many people get access to dvds and
flash drives smuggled in from China with

278
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,460
South Korean TV shows and movies.

279
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,660
It is now common for citizens who own
tvs and computers to see what the outside

280
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,960
world is truly like.

281
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,080
Even though I'm not allowed to leave.

282
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,660
Oh,

283
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,010
made an unlikely friendship with
a professional basketball player.

284
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,330
Dennis Rodman in,

285
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:58,391
uh,

286
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:02,620
2018 interview with CNN Rodman explained
that he wanted to give Kim Jong UN

287
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,090
present for his birthday by flying over
and American basketball teams in North

288
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,300
Korea.

289
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,360
No one in the country had
ever seen an NBA game before.

290
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,670
Despite the difficulty
getting into the country.

291
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,560
Rodman was able to pull it off,

292
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,640
Kim Jong and told him,

293
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,240
this is the first time someone
has ever kept their word to me.

294
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,410
He went on to explain that people usually
spout false promises about trying to

295
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:27,490
make peace with this country and that
makes it nearly impossible to trust any

296
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,324
outsiders.

297
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,910
For the people who have
defected into South Korea.

298
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,550
They say that the
transition comes as a shock.

299
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,480
There are so many more lights
causes people than they are used to.

300
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
Actress he owned me.

301
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:42,880
Park says that she is always studying
very hard to catch up to our peers by

302
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,510
learning how to read and write the Korean
language and catch up to everything

303
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,490
there is to know about the outside world.

304
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,840
We will never be able to read Kim Jong
Un's minds to see his long term goals.

305
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,290
If the truth of the outside world was
brought to these people who have been

306
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,320
living in isolated and depressed
life for so many years,

307
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,530
it would be a revolt and
Kim Jong widow loses power.

308
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,190
If he wants to open North Korea
up to the rest of the world,

309
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,740
it's not something that
can be done overnight.

310
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,760
Remember that these people are essentially
stuck in a time capsule at this

311
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,090
point.

312
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,470
Exposing them to the outside world all
at once would be incredibly overwhelming

313
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,850
and it may lead to bloodshed.

314
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,650
We don't know if he is more concerned
with keeping people oppressed to maintain

315
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,311
this power.

316
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:28,750
If he knows that the process
of globalization in North
Korea will take time,

317
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,820
what we can do is speculate

318
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,710
when he was alive and his father helped
himself to a higher and the actresses

319
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:41,340
and singers,

320
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,210
Lindsay arranged for his three sons to
have the ability to sleep with any woman

321
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:46,044
that they want it,

322
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
but according to Kenji Fujimoto,

323
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:51,090
the teenaged simply wasn't
interested in sleeping around.

324
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,100
He was very protective of his younger
sister and showed a lot of respect towards

325
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,000
women in general.

326
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,590
You fads to read books,

327
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:58,281
watch movies,

328
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:03,230
and play basketball over partying and
going on dates which you to was so shocked

329
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,850
by the boys' disinterest in the heart.

330
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,730
And he often wonders if
the boy was actually gay.

331
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,080
One day though and made comments that
confirms to Fujimoto that he did in fact

332
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,230
like girls just as much
as any other teenage boy.

333
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,240
He just wanted to fall in love.

334
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,050
Kim Jong Ung is married to
a woman named result Jew.

335
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,180
She was a singer in her younger years,

336
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,590
but often Mary and Kim Jong.

337
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,090
She began pursuing a college degree
in science and completed a phd.

338
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,810
The details about that relationship will
kept secrets and then marriage was only

339
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:36,620
announced in 2012 after he became
the new leader of North Korea.

340
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,220
However,

341
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,340
some say that they had already
been married for years before.

342
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:44,720
Then as first lady resells who enjoys
organizing events for how husbands and she

343
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:47,000
is often seen accompanying him in public.

344
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,280
While this seems totally
normal to the outside world,

345
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,060
Kim Jong Un is actually the first North
Korean leader who allowed his wife to be

346
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:53,894
seen in public.

347
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,800
He also brings along his sister arms
and one of his father's former consorts

348
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:01,460
with him to events because they are
part of this inner circle of advisors.

349
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,830
While may never know the
intimate details of his marriage,

350
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:07,070
that body language shows that they
are very loving with one another.

351
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,570
According to Dennis Rodman,

352
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,640
he met one of their daughters,

353
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,260
a little girl names Jua.

354
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,120
Many have speculated that
he has multiple children,

355
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:18,050
but they've never shown in the public
eye to protect their anonymity.

356
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,830
They are reportedly receiving a private
education abroad just like their father

357
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:22,310
did.

358
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,760
Instead of relying on a mail
outs take over his throne.

359
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,930
Kim Jong UN has been
paying for the training.

360
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:31,520
It was youngest sister Kim Jong so that
she can become the new supreme leader of

361
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,710
the country if anything
should happen to him.

362
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,150
She is usually present during very
important meetings with national leaders.

363
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,650
Bali is better than his father
and just about every way.

364
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,160
Kim Jong Un is far from
being the perfect leader.

365
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,000
North Korean citizens aren't still not
allowed to come and go from the country

366
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:54,834
as they pleased.

367
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,920
As a communist nation.

368
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,620
People are not allowed to
choose their own career.

369
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,891
They do.

370
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:03,060
You don't have freedom of speech or
religion and the press is a never ending

371
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,170
propaganda machine.

372
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,580
One of the main criticisms,

373
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:09,100
he receives this for the harsh
treatments of prisoners in the Gulags,

374
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:10,290
in the concentration camps,

375
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,210
prisoners are being used for uranium
mining and their bodies have been riddled

376
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,210
with radiation considering that he wants
to keep up with his nuclear arsenal.

377
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,350
Uranium mining has
become a necessary evil.

378
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,161
Then of course,

379
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,430
there's the facts that Kim Jong Un has
made multiple threats of nuclear war

380
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,990
against the United States.

381
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,310
This is an incredibly frightening thing
to think about and it has any Americans

382
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:32,910
on average.

383
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,241
However,

384
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,980
when you interviewed South Koreans,

385
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:38,940
not many people are worried despite the
fact that they live right next door,

386
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,940
but they believe that Kim
Jong Un's nuclear threats,

387
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:44,010
so the only thing that the country has
for leverage in order to prevent a more

388
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:45,660
powerful nation from invading.

389
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,440
Remember there are thousands of American
troops at the border and with all other

390
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:51,990
major powers in the world
owning nuclear weapons.

391
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,800
This is just a way for them to
become on level with mutually assured

392
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:56,430
destruction.

393
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,390
Meaning that no presidents in their
right mind would attack a country who has

394
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,440
nuclear weapons at their disposal because
it would mean both countries would be

395
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,230
obliterated evenly.

396
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,660
Military training is a requirements
for every citizen in North Korea.

397
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,460
Kim Jong never received any,

398
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,180
but the North Korean propaganda machine
has built up this myth that he was sent

399
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:18,210
away to receive some of the best
military training in the world,

400
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,930
so he runs military drills do keep
up this illusion he was given.

401
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,030
The equivalent ranking
is a three star general.

402
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,840
None of the young soldiers have ever
been to war and the military leaders from

403
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,420
the Korean world that will gone further.

404
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,990
North Korea has outdated weapons that
were given to them by the Soviet Union

405
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,120
decades ago,

406
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:39,360
and while they are dangerous and there
was no way they could ever win a war if

407
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,530
they took on South Korea.

408
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,150
A man named Robert Colin is
a CIA negotiated with North
Korea and he sums up the

409
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,070
grand show of nuclear power perfectly.

410
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,500
One thing every North Korean
leader has understood,

411
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,360
and Kim Jong Un does too,

412
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,460
is that if they lower their god,

413
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
they will be treated by the major
powers as the used furniture of history.

414
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,030
They will simply be discarded,

415
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,580
walkover ignored otherwise,

416
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,900
why pay any attention to them so they
have to make sure people care about them.

417
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,360
In 2018,

418
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,880
Kim Jong UN matched with the president
of South Korea Moon Jay and the

419
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,470
presidents of the United States,

420
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,333
Donald Trump,

421
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,110
in order to bring their countries to
a place of peace where progress can be

422
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:19,800
made,

423
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,370
we can only hope that there will be a
solution to this incredibly complicated

424
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,980
situation without ever going to war.

425
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,360
So Kim Jong UN and North Korea scary
stuff and you know what else is scary

426
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,780
hackers and not just off
the governmental variety.

427
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,970
I might sort of be joking.

428
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:38,040
It chances all your data isn't
really interesting to North Korea,

429
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,601
but hey,

430
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:42,960
every day we hear about in the news how
the some sort of latest hack or data

431
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,310
breach of some variety,

432
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,001
not good.

433
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,820
And governmental surveillance is
certainly something that goes on.

434
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,751
But good news,

435
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:53,040
you can protect yourself with a vpn
and that's where Nord vbn comes in.

436
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,540
I've been sitting in a cafe with some
open wifi network and I wanted to check

437
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,080
your internet banking world.

438
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,080
Don't even think about it without nor
to Vpn or let's say you were a foreign

439
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:08,670
person living in an oppressive
dictatorship with very
restricted internet and

440
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:12,740
you wanted to watch a funny youtube
video like this one very matter.

441
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,260
I know,

442
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,590
well,

443
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,630
Nord vpm will sort you out there too,

444
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,630
or maybe more likely,

445
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:20,100
you just want to watch gold local content
from your own country while abroad.

446
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,800
Well nor vpn can also do that.

447
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,780
Nor vpn is also super fast,

448
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:26,790
so watching video is a breeze,

449
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,350
no lag whatsoever.

450
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,600
So if you ever used vpns
and thought they were slow,

451
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,660
while that's certainly
not the case with Nord,

452
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,160
you can also use it on
all your devices very,

453
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:35,971
very easily.

454
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:36,511
Android,

455
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:37,050
chrome,

456
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,621
windows,

457
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,454
Linux,

458
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,640
and on six different
devices at the same time,

459
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,750
all with one account.

460
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:46,380
So that makes it incredibly
affordable also that are no logs kept.

461
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:49,960
Unlike some companies based in
the EU or the United States,

462
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,180
north vpn based in Panama,

463
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
they don't keep logs at all.

464
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,780
It's kind of like the
opposite of North Korea.

465
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,040
Great for your privacy.

466
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,670
Indeed,

467
