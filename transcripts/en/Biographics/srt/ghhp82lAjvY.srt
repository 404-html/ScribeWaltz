1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,260
Angus con, the name that is synonymous
with barbaric, cruelty and conquest.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,220
800 years ago, he created the greatest
army the world has ever known.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,720
Wielding it with tactical brilliance to
lay claim to the largest empire in world

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,350
history.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,220
No other man Alexander and Napoleon or
Hitler ever came close to the level of

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,820
success and conquest over
the Mongolian man of steel.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,850
So how did he do it? Well,
in today's biographics,

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,050
we discover how he simple peasant arose
from one of the harshest environments on

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,870
the planet to take the world by storm.

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,110
What we know about the early life
of this man, he would rise to rule.

11
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,660
The world comes from an accounts called
the secret history of the Mongols

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,080
written. Soon after he
died, it tells us the gang.

13
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:52,590
Gus was born somewhere in
the steps of Central Asia.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,470
Around the year 1165 it is said that
he was born with a clot of blood in his

15
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:59,230
hands, which was seen as
important of great things to come.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,140
Can I get some was born into
a harsh unforgiving world.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,000
The Mongols who lacked a common chief.

18
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,900
We're broken into a number of clans who
were constantly warring with each other.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,590
The landscape was vast and rugged,
situated between Europe and China.

20
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:15,310
It consisted of an inhospitable series
of rolling hills, rocky outcrops,

21
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,420
and freezing temperatures.

22
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,770
The Chinese referred to the region as the
barbarian wilderness and built a great

23
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:24,880
wall to keep its inhabitants from reading
their border regions for the Mongols

24
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,350
strength was found in numbers.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,130
Large families were encouraged with
polygamy and accepted custom gang gets.

26
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,450
His father had two wives.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,290
The boy's mother had been abducted from
her previous husband in another tribe as

28
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:39,010
a boy. Ganglius grew up with three
brothers, a sister and two half brothers.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,690
His earliest years were spent hunting,

30
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,530
writing and roaming the plains as part
of Eaton nomadic society. As clan,

31
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:48,160
we're constantly on the move seeking new
pastures whenever the grazing for their

32
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:50,590
sheep was exhausted.
Ganga is reported.

33
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:54,790
To have grown up as a brave and define
young man is only fear being dogs. Yes,

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,060
he was an introvert who preferred to
spends the bulk of his time alone with his

35
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,250
thoughts.
He was fiercely independent.

36
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:04,390
Seeing no value in consultation with
others as he emerged into his teens.

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,500
It was a parents too old that he had a
sense of his own destiny and that destiny

38
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,120
lay far beyond the clan.

39
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,910
That was then as well as was the custom
at around nine years old gangsters.

40
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,800
Parents arranged a marriage for their son.
His wife to be was named Burton,

41
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,030
who was from a neighboring tribe and gangs
was to be transferred to that camp so

42
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:23,980
that he could grow up
alongside his bright.

43
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,310
On the return trip after delivering
his son Gangas, his father,

44
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:30,160
I'm at a party of Tata,
has on their way to a hunting expedition.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,270
They seemed hospitable offering and
food and drink. However, the offerings,

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,870
they were laced with poison and
three days later his father died.

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,000
Gang gets quickly returned
to the father of this family.

48
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,980
They were abandoned by
the rest of the clan.

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,090
His mother Harlene now assumes the
mantle of headship within the household.

50
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:53,270
There was constant friction between
the three sons of how the Nams,

51
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,490
they're two stepbrothers, one
a. When he was 13 years of age,

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,950
Angus was holding a fish
that he had caught when one
of his stepbrothers came up

53
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,620
and snatched it from his
hands without hesitation,

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,870
Gingiss drew his bow and killed the boy.

55
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,280
This was the first clear demonstration
of the absolute ruthlessness that would

56
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,520
come to characterize the boy
who would become the great con.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,090
By the age of 15 ganglius was stronger,
bigger,

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,330
and it's more skillful in hunting
and horsemen shift than his brothers.

59
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,090
His brothers began to bow to him.
There's then natural leader,

60
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,260
his reputation as a strong warrior.
It began to spread soon,

61
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:27,880
the clown that had deserted his
family when his father had died,

62
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,990
got to hear if there's some start fearing
that he might lead as brothers against

63
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:35,950
them. He decided to take the initiative
by invading the family's encampments and

64
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:40,210
taking gangas captive.
The Angus was able to escape the invaders,

65
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,150
fanned out into the wilderness and
nine days later they found him.

66
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,050
Gang guest was taken prisoner and they
heavy wooden yoke was placed around his

67
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,680
neck a couple of days later,
and while is was languishing inside,

68
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,840
a guarded tends with the
yolk still around his neck.

69
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,270
His captors through a celebrator he party,

70
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,200
despite the inconvenience of the oak
gang guess managed to overpower is God.

71
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,990
He got down to the river before
his absence was discovered,

72
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,300
unable to traverse the river
while wearing the yoke.

73
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,940
He then returned to the tense
from which he had come there.

74
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,880
He found the guard we
had recently overpowered.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,010
Ganga is then displayed the shrewdness
of thinking, which was to set him a pass.

76
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,480
He told the guards that's unless he got
him out of the yoke and gave him a horse.

77
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,030
He would tell the others that
the guard had helped him escape.

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,480
The black nail worked until he was
soon galloping away from his captors.

79
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,940
A year later at age 60 and getting us
to return to the village of Berta girl,

80
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,510
he had been pledged to at the
time of his father's death.

81
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,000
It was time to get
married as a wedding gift.

82
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:38,720
The girl's father gave him a spectacular
sable coat. The next day, gang gets,

83
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:42,110
took his wife back to his encampments
and left her in the care of his mother.

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,470
He then wrote off to a neighboring clan
where he presented his new code has a

85
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,880
gift of the chief Dean by the name
of Todd rule. In doing so, again,

86
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,370
this was purchasing the allegiance
of this powerful clan leader.

87
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,180
He asked or grill to help him win back
the loyalty of the tribesmen who deserted

88
00:04:56,181 --> 00:05:00,440
his family after his father's death to
roll with sympathetic and it's impact was

89
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,630
formed between them.
News of the alliance,

90
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:06,050
it seems spread of the clans offered
their support and before long Gingiss was

91
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:09,260
able to call upon the formidable force
for four years before he could put them

92
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:12,410
into action. However, disaster
struck invading market.

93
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:15,860
Horseman came thundering across
the plains intent on kidnapping.

94
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:19,400
The women of Ganga says camp. The
majority of the clown managed to escape,

95
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,900
but again gets his young wife.

96
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,430
Bertha was taken captive by the markets
gangas desperately road for the camp of

97
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,264
to grow for help.

98
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,390
Doggerel announced that he would ride
upon the markets and destroy them

99
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:32,120
returning butter to our husbands.
Over the next few months,

100
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:36,230
the alliance managed to bring together
more than 5,000 warriors in order to ride

101
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,900
with them.
The attack was swift and decisive.

102
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,480
The Mongol hoards decimated
the market camp killing,

103
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:44,620
looting and pillaging without mercy.
In the midst of the campus,

104
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,500
they found butter.

105
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,370
She had been raped repeatedly and was
pregnant shortly after returning to camp.

106
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,480
She gave birth to a son,

107
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,860
but it was never known if
it was gangbusters child
or one of the market rate

108
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,694
tests

109
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,910
in the wake of the overthrow of the
market's Gingiss went from strength to

110
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,200
strength. He United with the clan
of his boyhood friends Jamica.

111
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,600
The two men became inseparable,
decluttering themselves. Blood brothers,

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,790
they lived together, ate together
and slept together. This rouse,

113
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,270
the jealousy of Ganga says wife and
mother who began to spread rumors about to

114
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,870
Jamaica and then just having
to do drive the two men apart.

115
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,400
Whether it was the influence of the
women in his life or his own lust for

116
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,243
absolute power.

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,600
Something caused Gingiss to sever the
bond with [inaudible] in 1185 the two

118
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,220
plans worth moving towards.
First,

119
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,540
our grazing grounds when in to scientists
to turn off and camp in a valley he

120
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,930
called to Ganga is to join him again,
gets ignored him and kept on writing,

121
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,310
carrying on a mile or so.

122
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,390
He turns in his saddle to see if there's
not only had his own kinsmen followed

123
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:42,620
him first as many of Jammu
because men had as well.

124
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,970
Ganglius was now developing the largest
following of any of the mongrel plants.

125
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,570
This was achieved poly through the design
for security and numbers and partly by

126
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,404
coercion.

127
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,010
Those who did not agree to give ganglius
their religions while they were forced

128
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,730
to do so.

129
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,210
The combination of his desire for power
and wealth and his need to feed his ever

130
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,390
expanding, following led to
repeated raids on other clams.

131
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,300
The capture if they're women ans
the plundering of their belongings.

132
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,100
The secret history of the Mongols
attributes equates to Gingiss,

133
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,500
which may be familiar to fans of the 1982
movie Conan the barbarian in which the

134
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,710
words were given to Arnold
Schwarzenegger's character.

135
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,040
The greatest pleasure is to vanquish
your enemies and chase them before you to

136
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,480
rob them of their wealth and see those
dear to them bathed in tears to ride

137
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:28,130
their horses and clasp to your bosom.
That wives and daughters at this point,

138
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,340
still in his early twenties Ganga said
already proved themselves to be brilliant

139
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:32,600
at psychological warfare.

140
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,680
He would attack a tribe with horrific
and devastating force in order to

141
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,370
intimidate the surrounding camps to
give up without a fight. As a result,

142
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,450
many thousands of his enemies simply
surrendered in order to avoid the carnage

143
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:46,100
that would result if they resisted.

144
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,960
Having subjugated ends melded into one
the disparate Mongol clans Gingiss now

145
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:55,490
set his sights on the furthest reaches
of the barbarian wilderness among those

146
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,450
who had not yet joined as alliance
was his former best friend, Jabuka,

147
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,320
who was now his mortal enemy.

148
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,410
The people of the two camps that have
been able to maintain a sort of uneasy

149
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,460
peace.
However,

150
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:08,390
one day a disagreements over grazing
lands erupted into violence with one of

151
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:12,230
Ganga says men killing a warrior from
Jim Lucas camp and outrage to Mooka

152
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:16,340
reacted by attacking the much larger
camp of Ganga the unexpectedness and

153
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:19,610
lightening speed of the rage resulted in
the killing of many and the capture of

154
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:23,600
70 of Ganga says chief teens who were
taken back to Jim Lucas camp where they

155
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,000
were tortured and boil the live gang gets.

156
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,490
He was shocked to his core
at this humiliating defeat.

157
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,420
He came to the realization that his
army was not yet ready to engage in the

158
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,450
large scale conquests that he
had envisioned. Consequently,

159
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,870
he sat out to to mold them into a
war machine, a breed of warrior,

160
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,750
the likes of which had
never been seen before.

161
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,160
The army that resulted was incredibly
mobile able to travel an average of 70

162
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:46,994
miles per day.

163
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,080
The men were subjected to the most
severe discipline in order to forge their

164
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,040
minds and bodies into warrior like steel.
Before long the reputation,

165
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,860
the barbarian super army spreads
beyond the boundaries of Mongolia.

166
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,440
When the rulers of the Chin
Empire in China heard about them,

167
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,590
they invited Gingiss to come and
help them fight off marauding bands,

168
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,080
the Tatas who were
constantly harassing them.

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,370
The toss is also a longtime enemies of
the Mongols and Ganga saw this as an

170
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:14,940
opportunity to exact vengeance while
expanding his reach internationally.

171
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,803
In short order,

172
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,730
the overpowering force of the Mongols
crushed the Tatas resending to try and in

173
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:21,240
their home country gangbusters army.

174
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:24,900
It was immediately attacks by Jim
Lucas forces. This time, however,

175
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,260
Gingiss was ready over a series of three
bloody encounters, Jamaica's followers.

176
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,710
We're finally subjugated Jamaica,
however,

177
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,570
managed to escape fleeing to
the sanctity of the Nyman's,

178
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:38,010
say powerful tribe dwelling and the
northwesterly region of the steps.

179
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,270
When news reached to Ganglius,

180
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:42,330
the Jamica joining the name and he
set his sights on destroying them,

181
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,300
he unleashed his 80,000
strong cavalry against them,

182
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,590
totally overpowering them in a frenzy
of blood Lessing amazingly, however,

183
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,360
Jimmy kept managed to escape.
Once again,

184
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,310
he had with a small cloud
of mountain dwellers.

185
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,420
They fearing the wrath of the invaders
betrayed Jamoca and handed him over to

186
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,040
the camp of Gingiss.
Gingiss.

187
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,830
Though he was sharp's by the
lack of loyalty to Jameka.

188
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,120
Mandy had them all slaughtered.

189
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,860
Then he extended mercy to Jamaica
with an offer of a pardon but true.

190
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,420
Mooka refused and begged
to be put to death.

191
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,140
A seeding to his wish can guess allowed
his old friend to be suffocated to death

192
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:17,030
inside a carpet. Despite his
reputation as an unfeeling execution,

193
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,680
Gingiss turned away
unable to watch the scene.

194
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,180
Having the feeds of the Nyman's Gangas
was now the supreme ruler of in excess of

195
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:32,740
2 million people. Having had a taste
of supreme power, he now wanted more.

196
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,530
That was still positive Mongo there
that were not part of his empire.

197
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,890
These were areas along the eastern
and southern regions of the country.

198
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,690
Over a period of months,

199
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:44,710
he systematically beat into submission
those who had not yet come under his yoke,

200
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,490
Ganga [inaudible] road at the very front
of his ferocious towards personally

201
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,530
overseeing every detail of the attack,

202
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,450
but his greatest skill and ability to
handpick brilliant generals. In doing so.

203
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,470
He managed to United people who had for
centuries been a war with one another in

204
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:04,060
1206 the people made Gingiss best supreme
ruler bestowing upon him the title of

205
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:08,050
Con, the Great Leader as recorded in
the secret history of the Mongols.

206
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:11,770
The people proclaimed,
we will make you a leader are great con.

207
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,070
We will fling ourselves like
lightening upon your foes.

208
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,790
We shall give you the fairest to girls
from the enemy. If we disobey you,

209
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,350
take our flocks and our wives and our
children and throw while worthless heads

210
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:27,970
upon the sands between military conquests,
Skanga enjoy the rewards of success.

211
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,870
He gathered more wives and had more
children by his first wife about it.

212
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,530
He had four sons who would each be given
rulership over a part of his empire.

213
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,920
Despite the wealth, luxury, and family
with which he now surrounded himself.

214
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,910
Gangas was tormented by vivid dreams in
which he was continually riding in the

215
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,530
conquest of one land after another
impels by these dreams and his own innate

216
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:48,250
ambition,

217
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,650
he became fixated on the vast lands
that lay beyond the Great Wall on our

218
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:53,484
southern.

219
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,330
In 12 days.
Six gangas cool.

220
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,110
Together a great summit of his generals
and tribal leaders to discuss his

221
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:06,070
planned invasion of China
between Mongolia and China.

222
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,660
Neva kingdom [inaudible]
the land of the time goods.

223
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,750
This was a key trade where between
the Central Asia and the West,

224
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,220
Gangas undertook a campaign of conquest
that within two years brought the entire

225
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:20,660
kingdom of [inaudible] under his domain
the way it was now open to invade China

226
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,140
and an effort to capitalize on his
previous dealings with the Chin Empire

227
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,740
concent, a peace envoy over the
wall, Jen authorities. However,

228
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,590
they were suspicious of the
visitors and they put them to death.

229
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,770
On hearing of this outcome.
Gingiss took two is tense and fasted.

230
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:37,220
For three days he emerged to announced
that the heavens declared that he would

231
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:42,221
be victorious and the time
to wreak vengeance upon the
chin was now with 40,000

232
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:45,020
cavalry men riding behind him.
Gangas crossed the border,

233
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,100
smashing over the wall and into China.
They then swept down upon the Chin Empire.

234
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,390
They approached with unrivaled speed and
quiet until almost upon the enemy when

235
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:56,180
the thundering of their horses
hooves shook the grounds,

236
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,370
the attacks that followed
were overwhelming,

237
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,310
crushing their enemies and
destroying their encampments.

238
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,090
It was during the Chin campaign that
the ruthlessness of Ganga Eskom became

239
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:08,960
legendary. He would use captured women
and children as human shields in battle,

240
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,710
forcing them to march ahead of his army
as they approached an enemy village.

241
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,680
Within two years of first invading China,

242
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,890
Ganglius had reached the Capitol
or lift the Chin Emperor John Do,

243
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,290
which is modern day Beijing,
the great city.

244
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,880
It was encircled by a wall and strongly
fortified Colin's army laid siege for

245
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:29,570
almost a year. Finally, with the
aid of siege towers and catapults,

246
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,260
the Mongols manage to breach the wall
after a fierce battle and that the cost of

247
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:37,220
thousands of Chinese lives,
the city fell off to subjugating the chin.

248
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,100
Emperor gang guest rode back to
the step country of his birth,

249
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,670
but it wasn't long before the spirit of
conquest. One small fired his ambition.

250
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,920
He now looks to the worlds beyond China.

251
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,890
He looked to the fringe of
Europe between China and Europe,

252
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,650
lay the vast Islamic
empire known as Kora San.

253
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,230
This area was ruled by a Shaw who had
power that equaled that of the Ganga is

254
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:58,490
himself, but calm, did not wish to
subjugate the lands of the shop.

255
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,510
He sold only peace sending a caravan
of envoys to acquire a satin. Yes.

256
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,670
Just after they crossed the border,
all of his men,

257
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,830
they were captured and
slaughters and enraged.

258
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,400
Angus sends another group of envoys this
time instructing them to go directly to

259
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:11,180
the shop.

260
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,660
They too were murdered by Islamic
soldiers for Gingiss who believed in the

261
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,970
absolute inviolability of envoys.

262
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,270
This was far too much time for
vengeance was once again his hands.

263
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,220
He says out at the head
of his largest army,

264
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:27,200
to date more than 200,000 man years of
savage butchery were unleashed upon the

265
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,690
Muslim people.
By the time the bloodletting subsided,

266
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,830
Gingiss Carlton had wrestled absolute
power away from the shop is vast empire

267
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,400
now spans from the Yellow Sea and the
east all the way to the Caspian and the

268
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,234
west

269
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,590
before attending to the steps.

270
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,360
Can Guess Khan and pointed his
son who good day is the APP.

271
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,270
He now face the problem of
controlling his vast empire.

272
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,880
In the summer of 1226 he wrote to the
head of a 180,000 warriors to crush an

273
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:56,090
uprising among the time good people
before he goes to them. However,

274
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,240
he fell from his whole since suffered
serious injuries and didn't turn or

275
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,770
bleeding over the coming months.

276
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:05,150
He only got worse on August the 18th
1226 and at the height of his powers he

277
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:09,290
died Ganga scarves, legacy. It would be
cemented by his grandson, Kublai Khan,

278
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,430
who extended the Mongolian Empire to
encompass two continents and to become the

279
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,650
largest empire in history. Perhaps gardens
most enduring contribution, however,

280
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,690
was this, although forge
through unspeakable violence,

281
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,950
his conquests brought about a peace and
stability that's enabled the first ever

282
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:28,940
flow of trade and ideas between
the eastern and Western worlds.
