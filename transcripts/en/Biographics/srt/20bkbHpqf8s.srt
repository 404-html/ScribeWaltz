1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,890
He was the wells most wanted
international terrorist,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,680
the Svengali like leader
at the helm of a violence,

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:09,900
political movements that brought havoc
and destruction the world over his names

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,780
of the world. It became instantly
familiar. A summer Ben Ladin,

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,590
we will recognize his image, a long
drawn face, the scraggly beard,

6
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,980
the Todd and yeah, discovering the man
behind the image that's never been easy,

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,030
causing him to be referred to as a
fact checkers. Nice map. Only now,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,380
six years after his death,

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,310
are we able to piece together a complete
profile of the life and death of the

10
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,960
man at the forefront of a violence,

11
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:35,110
political movements that
significantly impacted our worlds.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,610
And this week's biographics, we discover
the truth about a summer bin Ladin

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,431
that's all in the bin.

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,210
Ladin was born into a wealthy
industrialist family in the city of radar.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,150
In 1957 his father,
Mohammed bin Laden,

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,470
was a builder and contractor who during
his lifetime had 11 wives and at least

17
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,770
52 children.
His mother was a petite Syrian women.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,670
Muhammad was an ambitious businessmen
who had brought his family from Yemen to

19
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:19,050
Saudi Arabia in the hopes
of both advancing his own
professional opportunities

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,070
and providing opportunities for his
son's things while they went well and the

21
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,471
elder bin.

22
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:27,720
Ladin built important social relationships
and forged enduring bonds with

23
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,650
notable members of Saudi society,
including members of the house of Saudi.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,670
Saudi Arabia is ruling family Mohammed's
bills the bend laws in construction

25
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:40,050
corporation into one of the largest and
most profitable construction businesses

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,690
in the Middle East.
As he became more successful,

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,900
Mohammed further strengthened his
bond with the Saudi royal family.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,250
He used his money and influence Steve
Bolster the image of the House of south in

29
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:50,610
risen.

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,840
King Faisal decreed that all the nations
construction contracts would be awarded

31
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:58,020
to the bin. Ladin Corporation.
Mom had been lodged and well,

32
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:02,790
he died in a plane crash in 1967 the 10
year old a Sama was told at the time by

33
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,290
king five sal that today I have lost my
right hand, the construction corporation.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,550
It was then taken over by a summer's
older brothers back in mid 1990s it was

35
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,510
worth an extraordinary
$36 billion the summer.

36
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,170
He was then Greens to enter the family
business after successfully completing

37
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:23,940
high school with he further his education
at King Abdulaziz University that he

38
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:27,300
studied economics and management
with an eye to a future in business.

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,260
He also learns the behind the scenes
dynamics of the family enterprise.

40
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,363
Unlike a summer,

41
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,880
most of his brothers chose to attend
western universities where they were not

42
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,770
constricted by Islamic tradition.

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,090
This was particularly true with the Samas
half-brother Saleem known for his good

44
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:42,990
looks and discharge.

45
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,020
Psyllium was educated in London and flew
his own private plane in the late 1970s

46
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,050
Isama now in his mid teens began
to enjoy the excesses of wealth.

47
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,950
He would regularly make the trip to Beirut
Lebanon to take in the excitement of

48
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,480
the city is fast paced nightlife.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,440
He spent hours frequenting nightclubs
in casinos and often drank more than he

50
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:06,100
should have. He also began enjoying
the company of beautiful young women

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
around 1975 however,

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Osama bin Laden had a spiritual rebirth
causing him to return to Islam with a

53
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:28,250
third and devotion that altered his
goals and lifestyle drastically it again

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,760
when he decided to help with
restoration work on t mosques.

55
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,050
At the same time he began meeting with
Islamic fundamentalists and reading more

56
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:37,370
about the teachings of Islam.

57
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,930
Within weeks he had disowned his former
Luke's way of life and to become a

58
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,040
devout Muslim.
At the age of 20 assault,

59
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,140
my entered an arranged marriage with a
devout Syrian woman who was a distant

60
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,830
cousin. Together they immerse
themselves in Islamic fundamentalism,

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,330
rejecting Western values and priorities
and condemning it's greatest proponents

62
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,820
of the United States.
When Saudi Arabia,

63
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,430
king five sal was killed
by his derange nephew,

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,550
been lardons anti American sentiments.
They were reinforced.

65
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,120
The king's nephew had been educated
in the United States and to become a

66
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,880
complete the westernized bid laws,
and he was thrilled.

67
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,910
In 1979 when a fundamentalist religious
leader known as Ayatollah Ruhollah

68
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,040
Khomeini overthrew the Shah of
Iran who was seen as a puppet.

69
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,930
For the United States.
For the first time,

70
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,370
Islamic fundamentalists so seized a
Muslim country and established and Islamic

71
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,060
state.

72
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,830
Each gave undeniable proof that radical
Islamic forces could prevail over

73
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:32,170
Western decadence c.

74
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,340
Then towards the end of 1979 the Soviet
Union invaded the largely Muslim nation

75
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:39,410
of Afghanistan,
Soviet forces.

76
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,430
They were ruthless pouring overwhelming
fire power onto the Afghanistani

77
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,264
resistance.

78
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,390
They could also the president
of Afghanistan and put
their own governments in

79
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:51,290
place. Middle Eastern Arab nations. They
want understandably alarmed by this.

80
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,350
They were all sympathetic
to the Afghani cause,

81
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,830
but knew that none of them had the
ability to take on the Soviet war machine.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,850
Yet Islamic fundamentalists militants
were determined to do something.

83
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,450
Then I was doing the Soviets and
restoring Islam in its purest sense,

84
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,510
fit that definition of jihad or holy war.

85
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,040
Thousands of young men by Islam rather
than national boundaries traveled to

86
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,770
Afghanistan to risk their
lives for their beliefs.

87
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,210
Among them was a Somac been modern.
Wow.

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,800
The savings,
the invasion of Afghanistan.

89
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,490
It was the impetus that took a Sama bin
Ladin out of his comfortable life of

90
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:37,780
privilege and into his reincarnation.
As a freedom fighter? Yes, yes.

91
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:38,620
Unlike many others,

92
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:42,940
he did not unthinkingly grab an AK 47
and rush off to the desert to join the

93
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:44,740
guerrilla army.
His first stop,

94
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,820
it was in Pakistan where he set up a
recruitment station to bring Muslims from

95
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:52,150
surrounding Arab nations to
the cause of jihad. It seemed,

96
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,850
became a clear that his
business backgrounds and money,

97
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,830
we're going to be eight huge assets.

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,830
He organized to training camps where
the recruits learns the art of Strategic

99
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,130
Warfare Been Mosin.

100
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:05,360
It knew that the thousands of eager
young men he was gathering together and

101
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,890
needed a support network, so he also
began recruiting doctors, bomb experts,

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,600
military strategists and engineers from
all over the Arab wells is families

103
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,050
building backgrounds impelled him to
build the infrastructure that would be

104
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:21,370
needed to defeat the Soviets.
Many would come to fight sooner.

105
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,030
It found themselves digging trenches,

106
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,210
paving roads and it's
building hospitals and depots.

107
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,650
During the 1980s binladin was instrumental
in bringing together in Afghanistan

108
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,450
Nan's nearby areas of Pakistan,

109
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,570
more than 25,000 Muslim fighters from at
least 35 countries around them as live

110
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:41,630
well's. Yet support also came
from the most unlikely places.

111
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,130
The United States.

112
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,080
The U S was fixated on stopping Soviet
expansion and so we're willing to support

113
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:52,010
Islamic efforts to remove the communist
invaders from Afghanistan despite their

114
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,110
hatred of the United States.
That jihadists,

115
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,960
they gladly accepted they're
backing after all. It meant money,

116
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,070
weapons and suppliers.

117
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,300
Still they made sure that America
state well clear of their operations.

118
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,050
One Islamic intelligence officer noted
that no American instructor was ever

119
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,850
involved in giving training on any kinds
of weapon or equipment to the merger

120
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:12,470
has been or how you
fight it's been laws on.

121
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,490
It was instrumental in securing it from
the United States. Stingers, which way?

122
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,570
Heat seeking ground to air missiles
with the ability to bring down a Soviet

123
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:24,410
fighter plane with the aid of American
Stinger's been lardons men could bring

124
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:29,411
down at least 270 aircraft through their
fixation on defeating the Soviet spy,

125
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,420
whatever means necessary.
Vus.

126
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,710
They were creating a monster as
well as bringing money, resources,

127
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:40,130
and organizational skills or the
jihadist cause they didn't. Martin,

128
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,500
he fought alongside his fellow jihadists.

129
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,160
One of his trips recalls he was a hero
to us because he was on the front line

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,210
always moving ahead of everybody else.
He not only gave us money,

131
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,190
but he also gave us himself.

132
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,180
He came down from his palace to live
with the Afghan peasants and the Arab

133
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,630
fighters he cooked with them, ate
with them, dug trenches with them.

134
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,100
That was bin Ladin this way.
Ben Loves him. He was not
afraid of death, can fence.

135
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,030
There was a special place in the hereafter
for those who participated in Jihad.

136
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,170
Hey often stated that one day of fighting
in Afghanistan was like a thousand

137
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,660
days of praying and an ordinary mosque.
As a result,

138
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,130
he was more than willing to
become a martyr for the cause.

139
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,910
In 1989 after a painful decade, the
Soviets finally withdrew from Afghanistan.

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,230
Osama bin Ladin Return Saudi Arabia
with the reputation of jihadist heroic.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,040
He was hugely popular among the common
people and the ruling families or

142
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,880
friendship with him as a way to quell a
criticism from Islamic fundamentalists

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,250
who saw them as two
western been laws and well,

144
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:49,670
he milked his hero status for
absolutely everything it was worth.

145
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,970
He spoke a mosques and other places often
drawing large crowds of young men who

146
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:57,240
were inspired to help create an
Islamic fundamentalist world.

147
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,140
His speeches filled with venom against
the United States were often tapes with

148
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,500
over a million copies circulating
around the Muslim world display.

149
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,780
Returning to the rich
embrace of his family.

150
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,170
The summit did not avail himself of the
lavish lifestyle that was available to

151
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:10,560
him.

152
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,890
He moved into a modest apartment with
his wife and children and did his best to

153
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,160
live according to the strict
teachings of Islam and yes,

154
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,490
there was a fire still smoldering
inside of him that far.

155
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,890
It was inflamed in 1990 when Iraqi leader,

156
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,730
Saddam Hussein invaded the neighboring
nation of Kuwait with Saudi Arabia

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,620
looking to be his next target panic.
It rose in Saudi Arabia. Well been,

158
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,970
wasn't he stepped up? It's,
he offered his assistance.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,110
His experience in Afghanistan had allowed
him to map out a battle strategy that

160
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,460
would be able to save his country.

161
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,230
He was determined to that any Iraqi
aggression be mass by Muslim forces alone.

162
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,310
It's cool on the West for help would be
he argued contrary to Islamic teaching

163
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,470
and demoralizing to the nation bin.

164
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:53,220
Ladin warns the Saudi government that
assistance from the u s would mean that

165
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:55,830
Islamic fundamentalists
would withdraw support,

166
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,600
but Saudi Arabia as minister of Defense,

167
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:01,410
Prince Sultan knew that even been lardons
forces could not defend this country

168
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:02,130
from the air,

169
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,060
naval and chemical attacks as well as
biological weapons that Saddam Hussein,

170
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,510
how did this disposal on one occasion
been lots and even burst into the

171
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,650
principal's office and yells, there
is no need for American troops. Yes,

172
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,650
we're in the prince asked him how he
could save the people from an hierarchy,

173
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:21,210
chemical weapon attack. You could only
reply. We will defeat them with our faith.

174
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,600
The Saudi government is rather and
surprising and he did turn to the United

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,010
States for help. The results was the Gulf
War. The US led western assault on Iraq.

176
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,400
Saddam was pushed back until negate it.
However,

177
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,640
the outrage of bin Ladin is
fundamentalist followers.

178
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,750
US military forces remained in the
region in case the dog made any further

179
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,710
aggressive moves.

180
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,490
The House of Saudi he would not long
before seen association with Bin Ladin as

181
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:45,324
an asset.

182
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,950
I've got nervous at a Samas hero status
and huge popularity they wanted to to

183
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,460
restrain him from making negative public
comments about their reliance on the

184
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:53,970
west,

185
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,320
threatening to remove the lucrative public
contracts that had made his family so

186
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,183
wealthy.

187
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,533
Okay.

188
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,310
The relationship between
[inaudible] and the house of Saudi,

189
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,610
it quickly deteriorated to the point
that in 1991 but he was expelled from the

190
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:18,880
country. Three years later,
his citizenship was revoked.

191
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,860
He fled to sit down with
his immediate family,

192
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,470
which now included three
wives and 15 children.

193
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,910
They moved into a brick and stucco home
in Khartoum where he lived a simple and

194
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,040
deeply religious life in Sudan,

195
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,350
been mods and quickly found
support for his ideology,

196
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,560
which was fiercely opposed to
any collaboration with the West.

197
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,850
His goal was to overthrow regimes that
were friendly to the u s and establish in

198
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:41,860
that place true Islamic states.

199
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,460
The first step towards that end would
be to strike at a u s targets throughout

200
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:46,750
the world.
By doing so,

201
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,620
it was believed that the United States
would be forced to withdraw from the

202
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:50,720
Middle East.

203
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,000
Even the governments that had been
propped up or by could easily be toppled.

204
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,840
The nucleus of the terrorist organization
that would bring about these changes

205
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:02,200
was a group that bin Ladin helps
develop and as you might know it,

206
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,380
it was called al Qaida
from their base in Sudan.

207
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,370
Experienced al Qaeda leaders were sent
to various parts of the world where there

208
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,290
were large Muslim populations.

209
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,490
Their mission was to incite and Islamic
revolution and carry out acts of

210
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,830
terrorism and his first year in Sudan,
they love him.

211
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,010
He became a disciple of
Hassan Abdallah to Robbie,

212
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,080
the Islamic spiritual leader of Sudan.

213
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,530
Wasy Robbie helps a sama to
deepen his spiritual development,

214
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,700
been Larson in turn built up to
Robbie's jihadist group Greek,

215
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,780
the popular international
organization or P I own.

216
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,120
He also builds connections with various
international finance institutions to

217
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,970
channel money towards his
growing terror networks.

218
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,750
At the same time he could
smuggle terrorists into the
United States by arranging

219
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:47,870
for them to be employees of companies
that were owned by wealthy pro Islamic

220
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,140
Middle East and businessmen.
Meanwhile,

221
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,780
Mincey dawn been laws and established a
building company known as the owl Hirafu

222
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,430
construction developments limited.

223
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,720
Its sole purpose was to
build an infrastructure in
Sudan to move the equipment,

224
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,200
vehicles and weaponry needed
to expedite terrorist acts

225
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,380
by the mid 1990s bit laws in an
established a worldwide reputation as a

226
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:20,790
revolutionary with thousands of young
jihadists idolizing him and dreaming of

227
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,840
being just like him.

228
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,520
The first bombing attack that was credited
to been large and was the December

229
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,010
29th, 1992 attack on two
hotels in Arden, Yemen.

230
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,970
Both hotels were frequented by US
military personnel in the area.

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,820
Three people were killed and five
more were wounded in the attack.

232
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,080
This was part of a concerted efforts
to oust the Americans from the Horn of

233
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,990
Africa and assert fundamentalist
Islam power in the region.

234
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,490
The focus of the action was in Somalia
where bin Laden organized fierce fighting

235
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:50,760
against US forces who were
there for humanitarian purposes,

236
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,930
been laws and counted the withdrawal of
US troops from Mogadishu as among his

237
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:59,520
most significant victories against the u
s then following his actions in Somalia

238
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:03,330
Been Ladin turned his attention to
Europe is first step was to bolster the

239
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,850
Islamic fundamentalist
movement in the Balkins.

240
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,900
Before setting his sights on Western
Europe and the United States Muslim

241
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,280
communities in these places,

242
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:16,140
wet saturated with pro Islamic
anti western propaganda
been laws in also relied

243
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,510
heavily on email and the
Internet to get the word out.

244
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,920
In 1995 Alica eater turned its attention
back to the Middle Eastern nations,

245
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,160
but if the leaved where roadblocks
to the establishment of Islamic

246
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,680
fundamentalist regimes
throughout the Muslim world,

247
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,210
but London saw Egypt and Saudi Arabia as
the two biggest obstacles to his course

248
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,080
in Saudi Arabia, he became obsessed
with overthrowing the house of salt.

249
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,520
In November of 1995 he orchestrated
the bombing of a u s military training

250
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:44,910
center in Riyadh killing seven people,
thousands of south.

251
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,330
They were outraged at the attack,
convinced the bin. Ladin was behind it.

252
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,640
A few days after the attack
for mercenaries from Yemen
opens fire with Ak 40

253
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,070
sevens outside of his residence in Sudan,

254
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,980
bin Laden's bodyguards
returns firing within minutes.

255
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,590
Three of the assailants and two bodyguards
with debt from that day on some of

256
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:05,150
the bin Laden's House and street
were transformed into an armed camp.

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,310
It wasn't just the house of
salad that we're offering though.

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,200
In 1996 a US special forces operation was
launched to capture bin Laden with the

259
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,050
aid of American friendly Muslim nations.
From then on,

260
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,880
he refused to venture out of C.
Dot.

261
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,290
But then both Saudi Arabia and the u s
turned up the screws threatening economic

262
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,710
sanctions on the Sudan unless
they handed the nodding over.

263
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,980
He was quickly asked to leave and he
and his wife and children edit for

264
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:32,870
Afghanistan in May of 1996
safely ensconced in Afghanistan.

265
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,460
[inaudible] now fully embraced the role
of international leader of the Islamic

266
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,330
extremist movements just stay alive
though me just surround himself with many

267
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,164
body guards.

268
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,890
He established a three room operations
space in a cave that had been carved out

269
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,920
to the side of a mountain that was
equipped with basic furnishings,

270
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,460
is only connections to the outside
world where it's satellite phone and two

271
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:55,530
laptops.
Then in 1998 been lots turn internists,

272
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,200
destructive attention back to Africa.

273
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,110
It's plan was the bomb two US embassies
in different African countries would

274
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:06,290
always the seventh simultaneous attacks
in Kenya and Tanzania kills hundreds of

275
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,360
people.
Although he denied responsibility.

276
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,580
The international
community where unanimous,

277
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,530
that's bin Ladin was behind the attacks.

278
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,270
As a result of the u s stepped up its
attempts to take him out with an air

279
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:20,660
strike on October the 20th known as
Operation Infinite reach. It destroyed it.

280
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:24,160
Three terrorist training camps in
the Afghani mountains, but bin Ladin,

281
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,460
he remained at large.

282
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,190
A year later, he was connected
to an attack on the u s
Navy destroyer, USS Cole.

283
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,060
There should that stop to refuel in the
port of od in Yemen when the terrorists

284
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,650
blasted this killing 17 sailors less than
a month after that two planes smashed

285
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,720
into the twin towers of
the World Trade Center.

286
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:54,860
In New York city striking a devastating
blow with the very symbol of American

287
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,200
business and achievement.
Within moments,

288
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,490
it had been transformed into a full
blown war zone. About 45 minutes later,

289
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,790
the terror struck again a high drag
down our liner that it departed from

290
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,780
Virginia with spear headed
into the Pentagon, the
nation's military headquarters,

291
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,460
the horrific,
shocking attack.

292
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,600
The deadliest since Pearl Harbor was a
major wake up call for the United States,

293
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,130
or $25 million reward was offered for
bin Laden and anti terrorist task forces

294
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,520
were set up despite a full on
effort to bring him to justice.

295
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,380
Bin Laden was able to remain at large
plotting further attacks for another

296
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,740
decade.

297
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,040
Sometime in the mid two thousands he
slipped into Pakistan for a while and he

298
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,760
stayed in rural mountain villages
protected by local tribal leaders.

299
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,970
He then moved to the bottom bad
compounds with three of his wives.

300
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,800
He now at five and 13 of his children and
it was that that the Americans finally

301
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:43,634
got them.
Yeah.

302
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,360
In the early morning hours of May.

303
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:59,880
The second 2011 about 25 navy seal
commander has descended on the [inaudible]

304
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:00,714
bad compounds.

305
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,000
They quickly breached the 18 foot walls
and then storms of the house using

306
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,690
explosives to gain entry
to men encountered on the
first floor were killed and

307
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:10,830
then the commandos rushed upstairs
where they identified and kill has been

308
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,090
Larson.
He was shot in the chest and the forehead.

309
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,280
One of his wives was also shot in the leg.

310
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,890
When she lunged at a seal to
make sure they got their man.

311
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:20,530
One of the seals took a photo and then
quickly put it through your facial

312
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,640
recognition software.

313
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,880
The results showed a 95% likelihood that
this was some of in London later DNA

314
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,200
testing,
put it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

315
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,920
The world's number one terrorist
is debt or some of it in London.

316
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:36,070
He was buried at sea shortly
after the race. Unfortunately,

317
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,520
the terror organization that he created,
it remains to this day,

318
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,920
