1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,000
In the 1970s one six foot nine
inch tall man named Edmund Kemper,

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,770
towered over his peers and most
considered him to be a gentle giant.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,060
No one in his life could have imagined
that he would murder six teenage girls

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,190
hitchhiking through Santa Cruz,
California,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,790
or that he would finally turn
his rage on his own. Mother,

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,910
no one in campus life
have a got any bad vibes.

7
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:26,670
Cindy didn't show him any signs that
there was anything wrong, actually bad,

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,250
a genius level Iq ends.

9
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:32,240
He was the kind of person you could
imagine having a fascinating conversation

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,980
with over a cup of coffee.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,790
He was so likable indeed that no one
would have ever guessed that he could be

12
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:42,050
capable of killing a total of 10
people and defiling their corpses.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,980
He covered his tracks so thoroughly that
he would never have been caught either

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,630
until he picked up a pay phone and
turned himself in. Today on biographics,

15
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,840
we're talking about gentlemen Dicamba,
the coed killer.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,603
Okay.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,460
Edelman's Kemper was born in
1948 in Burbank, California.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,810
He was a very sensitive and intelligent
boy. Like many families at that time.

19
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:19,040
Ed's parents raised chickens and grew
their own vegetables in the backyard as

20
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,540
idolized his father and he loved to spend
time with the chickens and the other

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,940
farm animals as if they were as pets.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,210
He gave them all names and played
games with them in the backyard.

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,030
His mother was always quick to
reprimands and discipline him,

24
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:35,450
so he was always a very well
behaved child. He has two sisters,

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,520
one older and one younger who received
more love and attention from them about

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,250
that.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,400
Ed was still in primary school when it's
fall of the chops to have the chickens

28
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,860
heads off in front of
him. Later, of course,

29
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,240
his mother would cook
for birds for dinner.

30
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,750
When you refuse to eat is pat says
herons challenge and the same over at the

31
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,441
dining table,

32
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:55,880
forcing him to eat the chicken through
his tears that night he got on his bike

33
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:59,720
and he wrote as far away as he could, but
he would find that there was no escape.

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,290
His father would slowly force him to
get over his sensitivity of watching

35
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,570
animals killed.
As time went on,

36
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:09,340
he grew numb to the blood and the
headings and he learned to accept it.

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,800
This is just a part of life adds.
Later went on to kill a cat.

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,700
He couldn't understand why the adults
in his life were telling him the killing

39
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:21,020
farm animals was acceptable,
but killing a dog or a cat with symphony,

40
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,930
not his parents got a divorce
when he was nine years old,

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,680
but his mother was so bitter that she
began to take all of our hatred out on Ed.

42
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,210
She's ads that all men were worthless
and she began to treat add far worse than

43
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,220
his sisters simply because he was a boy.

44
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,540
She moved to Montana and she got
remarried. The second marriage,

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,380
it didn't work out.

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,770
He threatens his mother went through a
string of boyfriends that never lost it

47
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:47,030
very long as a male role model, as a
child being raised by now, single mother,

48
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:50,810
they did not have a lot of toys, so they
would use their imagination instead.

49
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,110
Add rattled lots of books from the
library and is included in his reading

50
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:57,890
horrific stories from history,
from the vikings to the Holocaust.

51
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,840
He suggested that he and his younger
sisters could play a game called of a gas

52
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,440
chamber.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,830
They tied each other up in a chair just
to see you get themselves out of the

54
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,820
bondage the quickest,

55
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,050
pretending that they were stuck in a room
that was filling up with deadly gas is

56
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,860
another insist is had bedrooms upstairs
and Edwin's had slept in a bedroom

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,731
upstairs as well,

58
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,280
but his mother decided to move
his bedroom down to the basement.

59
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,970
She was convinced that he would
hurt his sisters instead of a bad,

60
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,630
he have to sleep on a cot where the
sleeping bag with only a single light bulb

61
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,580
hanging from a string.
It was damp,

62
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,570
cold and frightening with only the
rats to keep him company at night.

63
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,651
According to him,

64
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:37,060
he interpreted that his
mother has a deeper meaning
behind our actions. He said,

65
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,410
why am I going to the basement?
I'm going to hell that going to heaven.

66
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,650
Ed was incredibly tall for his age,

67
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,830
so everyone assumes that he
was older than he actually was.

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,080
He started driving when
he was only 10 years old.

69
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,510
This was totally illegal of course,

70
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,090
but his mother must have allowed
him to use the family car.

71
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,660
One day he drove himself to a carnival
and there was an attraction where people

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,080
could slide their head
into a real guillotine and
pretend to have the heads cut

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,891
off and soar.

74
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:12,280
It has a strange contradiction that
people were laughing and squealing and the

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,910
face of death just for the thrill of it,
even though it was all just pretends.

76
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,170
Ed Kemper, he got excited and found
himself wishing that it was actually real.

77
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,490
It was in this moment and that is
delusions began to get far worse and he

78
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:29,290
actually began having
difficulty deciphering what
was real and what was fantasy.

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,400
A 13 years old life at home with his
mother became so toxic that he ran away

80
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:37,690
from home to try and live with his
father runs his new step mother in Los

81
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,590
Angeles,
but the reunion,

82
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,190
which only last a couple of months because
he sent ed to live with his parents

83
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,510
on there,
17 acre farm.

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,710
His grandparents lived in a remote
and occasion on the top of a mountain

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,000
surrounded by their
massive farm farmlands.

86
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,830
He was completely isolated
from the outside world. Yeah.

87
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,540
His grandmother was just as domineering
and abusive as his mother and his

88
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,690
grandfather. You have dementia
since they lived on so much lands,

89
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,810
his grandparents were to allow him to
use a rifle to hunt rabbits, squirrels,

90
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,644
and raccoons.

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,640
His grandmother would carry the guns with
her whenever she left the house for a

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,500
year and a half,
things were going fine until edge.

93
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,710
Went back to see his mother for
the first time in almost two years,

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,280
she knew exactly which buttons to
press to make them feel worthless.

95
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,210
Being around his mother triggered his
delusions to come back and any progress he

96
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,410
made and his mental health. It was lost.
Upon returning to his grandparents' farm,

97
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,990
he slipped back into a
delusional mental state.

98
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,470
He presented to leave the house and then
he shot his grandmother in the back of

99
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,620
the head with his rifle. Then he
killed his grandfather saying this.

100
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,860
He did not want him to live through
the pain of knowing that his wife was

101
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,470
murdered during a later
interview at Camp said,

102
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,920
but it was a good thing that he was so
isolated from society on the farm because

103
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,910
he was so angry at the
world in that moment that he
knows he would have become a

104
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:50,170
mass murderer when his delusion was
over reality set in and they'd sore.

105
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,240
His grandparents were
bleeding on the floor.

106
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,780
He could've driven far away from the
scene and no one would have known about

107
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,010
their deaths for an incredibly long time.

108
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,140
But the first thing he
did was called his mother.

109
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:04,230
He told her what had happened and she
told him to call the sheriff and turn

110
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,600
himself in. So he did. When police showed
up to arrest him, he went willingly.

111
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,640
When he was asked for an explanation,
he owns it.

112
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,030
I wanted to see what it
would be like to kill grandma

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,900
since he was 15 when he killed
his grandparents said, can put,

114
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:27,290
was still considered a minor and he went
to a mental hospital without having to

115
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,370
serve any jail time.

116
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,820
Doctors gave him multiple tests and they
discovered that he had a genius level

117
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,890
Iq and he was diagnosed with
paranoid schizophrenia and can put,

118
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,530
hey actually love living at the hospital
because he was finally getting the help

119
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,700
that he so deeply needed.

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,750
He took the proper medication and there
was a lot of structure and stability in

121
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,850
his life,
his mind,

122
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:49,670
it began to heal and he was fully in
touch with reality for the first time in a

123
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,480
long time.

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,020
He was even given a job shadowing one of
the doctors because they believed that

125
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,920
he could get better runs, that he would
still have a bright future ahead of him.

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
This meant he was able to remain calm
and give the answers that the doctors

127
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,500
wanted to hear.
When they interviewed him,

128
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,130
they weren't convinced that he had made
a full recovery and they set him free.

129
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,770
After four years while he was in custody,

130
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:13,340
he told his doctors all about the abuse
that he had endured from his mother as a

131
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,520
child and he begged for them not
to send him back to live with that.

132
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,210
It's doctors promised him that this would
not happen and they agreed that living

133
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,310
with her were there any
mannequins mental health was,

134
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,070
but the judge ultimately have
the final say and he bought,

135
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:29,180
had Camba back into his mother's custody.
Now that he was a full grown adults,

136
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,510
he grew to be a six
foot nine inch tall man.

137
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,840
He was so huge this you have to
dock in order to get into a room.

138
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,560
He spent his childhood being raised by
conservative adults since all of his

139
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,800
teenage years were spent in a
mental hospital so that Ken Burns,

140
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,540
he was shocked to be thrust into the free
love movement and the Hippie Cultural

141
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,890
Revolution that was
happening in California.

142
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,610
He felt very awkward and uncomfortable
and could barely hold a conversation with

143
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:55,940
a girl. He was 21 years old when
he first went out on a date.

144
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,600
He took a girl to Denny's and a John
Wayne Movie Bus and all felt incredibly

145
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,190
awkward. He didn't smoke, party,

146
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,090
didn't listen to music or go to
parties like most kids of his age.

147
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,960
In the 1960s and seventies his mother
had raised him saying that all men were

148
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:12,410
awful people and she worked at the
University of California Santa Cruz with

149
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,060
female students.
In many ways.

150
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,750
His mother was a third wave
feminists to truly did despise men.

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,740
Having this shoved in his face on a
regular basis made Kemper project is hate

152
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:25,760
towards his mother, onto other women.
He had fantasies about being with women,

153
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:28,490
but he didn't have fantasies
about being in a relationship.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
It's kind of been decided that he wanted
to become a police officer because

155
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:41,590
there was a lot of structure and order
in that profession and it would be a good

156
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,680
and steady job. Oddly
enough, there wasn't.

157
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:47,460
His juvenile record that stopped him
from becoming an officer is rac ought had

158
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,520
been expunged, so it was as if
fitted never happened at all.

159
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,300
It was actually his height that stopped
him since there was a limit on how tall

160
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,570
a police officer be. He decided that
if he couldn't get a job as an officer,

161
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,840
he still wanted to be friends with cops
and he started hanging out with the

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,730
police that have arc or the jury room.

163
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,910
He founds a job for the California
highway departments after getting out of

164
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,210
prison and for a short while he had his
own apartment since and independence in

165
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:12,180
life away from his mother,
but when he fell into financial hardship,

166
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,010
he was stuck living with her again.

167
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,510
They would often get into
intense arguments that made
the situation worse on a

168
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:21,390
daily basis at drove and drove and drove.

169
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,630
He took out by habits of picking up
hitchhikers and giving them rides.

170
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,220
This was very common back in the 1960s
and seventies and college students held

171
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,620
up signs saying the location of
where they wanted to go in his mind.

172
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,800
Yet this fantasy of killing a
young woman that he would pick up,

173
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,640
he would practice picking up both men
and FEMA hitchhikers and letting them go

174
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:42,240
free. He did this over 150
times just as practice runs,

175
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,360
say that he could feel prepared
for any scenario at the bar.

176
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:48,480
He was listening very closely to what
police officers were saying about their

177
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:52,260
new cases and they mentioned the facts
and this teenage girls runaway over time.

178
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,810
I need to show up sometime later.
In his mind,

179
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,500
he was living out a fantasy where he
would pick up a girl so that he could rape

180
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,410
and murder her. Through all of
these practice conversations,

181
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:05,400
he figured out what to do in order
to make people feel more at ease.

182
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,420
He also concocted a plan to drop a chap
stick into the passenger door so of his

183
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,050
victims trying to escape. They could no
longer open the door from the inside.

184
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,760
His fantasy was finally realized on May
the seventh 1972 when you picked up to

185
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:22,620
18 year old girls named Mary and Pascoe
and Anita New Chasa are in Berkeley,

186
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,680
California. They asked for a
ride to Stanford University.

187
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,430
He drove them to a secluded area in the
woods and locked in eater in the trunk.

188
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,390
He stabbed,

189
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,380
strangled Maryann before opening the
trunk and killing a needs in the same way.

190
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,550
Often they would dad,

191
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,450
you raped them and stuff that bodies
into the trunk of his Ford Galaxy on the

192
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,250
drive home.
A police officer pulled him over.

193
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,950
He was able to remain calm
as if nothing has happened.

194
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,970
The officer told him that his tail
light was out and he went on his way.

195
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,300
He laid to dismembered their bodies,
put them into bags and dumped these bags,

196
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,580
models,
pause in order to throw the police off.

197
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,210
Universities in the local area began to
tell the students not to accept rides

198
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:58,044
from strangers.

199
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,980
They also told everyone that if they had
no choice but to accept a ride to only

200
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,980
get into cars with a campus sticker on it.
Ironically,

201
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:08,760
as Canva actually did have one of these
stickers from UC Santa Cruz since his

202
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,110
mother worked for the college on September
the 14th 1972 he picked up a 15 year

203
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:17,280
old girl named Eiko Coo who needed a ride
to a ballet class and he kills her in

204
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:18,114
the same fashion.

205
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,380
On January the seventh of 1973 he killed
Cyndi shawl instead of disposing of

206
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,420
Cindy's remains like he
had done with the others.

207
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,770
He buried in the yard facing
towards his mother's bedroom window.

208
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,760
Cindy's had was actually sitting in the
trunk of his car when he went to his

209
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,300
state mandated therapy session.

210
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,620
His psychiatrist was convinced that he
was better and they released him from the

211
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:41,220
court order to continue therapy
even though he kills months apart.

212
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,150
Ed Kemper continued to give rides to young
women on a regular basis just so that

213
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:47,880
he could get information about what
the public was saying about him.

214
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,790
These women were so unaware
that had Kemper was a murderer,

215
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,340
that they would even have a conversation
with him about this coed killer

216
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:58,740
speculating about his motivations. He
would hang out at the jury room, bars up,

217
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:00,340
learn new information about the case.

218
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,000
He also wants you to a lot of crime
shows on TV in order to understand every

219
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,430
possible way that they might
catch up to him. For example,

220
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,730
he had the edge to go to the funerals
of his victims and pay his respects,

221
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,190
especially when he sold the detectives,

222
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:13,450
so waste drop to the funeral
of a homicide victim.

223
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,120
He knew not to give in to
these natural impulses.

224
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,870
On February the fifth 1973 you got us
into a very intense argument with his

225
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:24,700
mother and he went out and killed two
more girls, the Thorpe and Alison Lube.

226
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,090
He finally made the connection that the
anger he felt towards his mother was the

227
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,250
trigger that set him off
on this killing spree.

228
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,210
He knew that if he wanted the killings to
stop, he would need to kill his mother,

229
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,480
but this plan would be put on hold.
When the police showed up at the camp,

230
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,314
the residents

231
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,630
a few days on the,
yeah,

232
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,430
the police received a tip that
Ed Canva had purchased a gun,

233
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,060
the Chopin who could see that his personal
record had been expunged and that he

234
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,540
had committed a murder when he was under
18 the shop owner reported it to the

235
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,350
police and gave them add Kemper's name
and address. When the police showed up,

236
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,120
they recognized Ed Kemper from the boss,

237
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:04,660
so they assured him that it was just
a formality and led them to his closet

238
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,830
where he kept several guns.

239
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,790
Sitting next to those weapons
was a woman's pennys into
box filled with mementos

240
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,280
from his victims,
but for the police officers took notice.

241
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:16,060
He quickly distracted them and led them
out to his car where he had more hidden

242
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,670
weapons. They did not suspect
him of being the murderer,

243
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,790
but he was very paranoid and he was
convinced that they were onto him for an

244
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,240
entire week. He plant his mother's
murder. When she came home,

245
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:28,660
it was late and night and edge Kemper
[inaudible] stumbled through the front

246
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,070
door at four o'clock in the morning.

247
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,770
It was at this point that he smashed
her head in with a Claw Hammer,

248
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,570
even decapitated her sexually violated
her face and ripped out of vocal chords,

249
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,580
shoving them in the garbage disposal.

250
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,620
Then he placed her head on the mantle
piece and started throwing dancer

251
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,410
[inaudible].
When his rage subsided,

252
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,360
he realized that he had to
make it look like a breakin.

253
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,690
Otherwise the police might suspect him.
He called up his mother's best friend,

254
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,540
Sally hairless, and said that he
had made a dinner for them both.

255
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,310
When she arrived,
he strangled her.

256
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,850
He then stuffed their bodies into a
closet and left a note for the police.

257
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,170
After killing his mother, the torment
stops. He packed his bags and drove far,

258
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:02,950
far away.

259
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,250
He was able to actually start speaking
to women without fantasizing about

260
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:08,920
killing them because the source
of his anger, it was gone,

261
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,100
but he realized he couldn't live with
the guilt any longer and he actually

262
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,890
wanted to stop hiding
and pay for his crimes.

263
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,210
If found the nearest payphone to call
and confess that he was the coed killer,

264
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,900
he waited patiently there for
them to arrive on the ride back.

265
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:26,170
He gave the police officer's every little
detail of his crimes and the police

266
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,510
officer's felt sick from listening to him,

267
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,620
but he was in custody at that openly
admitted that he could not control these

268
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,870
delusions that had taken over his mind.

269
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,450
He begged for a lobotomy so that he
never had the urge to kill anyone.

270
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,480
Never again. That's, that never happens.

271
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,060
He was sentenced to 10 counts
of first degree murder.

272
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,530
He is still alive today
that he's currently spending
life in prison and his time

273
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:48,190
behind bars.

274
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,920
He has shown a sense of remorse for his
crimes and he gladly assisted in the

275
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,940
research on the psychology of serial
killers only agreeing to video into audio

276
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:56,750
interviews.

277
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,410
He also began to teach classes and
computer literacy to fellow inmates and he

278
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:03,980
has since spoken very eloquently mean
has even started reading audio books for

279
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:07,040
the blind since he was always so
polite and on his best behavior.

280
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,800
He was allowed to leave prison and to
live in a reform hospital. Psychiatrist.

281
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,460
See, listen to the tapes of Ed
camp, but describing his life.

282
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,960
Believe that his mother must have had
borderline personality disorder or it's,

283
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,280
if it were not for all of
the abuse that he endured,

284
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,170
he would never have
become a serial killer.

285
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,130
Other say that he was just
born a sociopath and that
killing it meant nothing to

286
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:25,520
him.

287
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,230
They believe that any sign of guilt or
remorse is simply just for show because

288
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,840
it was so good at studying
real human emotion.

289
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,960
No matter what the truth behind Ed camp,
his mental state may be,

290
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,340
none of it justifies what happened to
his victims and it will never bring back

291
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:42,500
the lives of the women that he kills.

292
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,110
If we can learn anything
from the story of Ed Kemper,

293
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,100
it's that we never truly know what goes
on inside the minds of the people that

294
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:52,790
we see every day. You just might never
know that that kind man next door,

295
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,330
there's a serial killer, so I really
