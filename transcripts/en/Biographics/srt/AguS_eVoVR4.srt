1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,490
Two thousand years
after his assassination,

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:05,280
he is still revered as
one of the greatest real,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,810
as in all of history.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,020
Yet his story reverberates as a tale
of the dangers of power on bounds.

5
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:16,770
It is military genius and political
skill saw him rise to the position of

6
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,060
dictator for life,

7
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,280
but it all came to a bloody end.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,630
On the ides of March.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,040
In this week's biographics,

10
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:28,041
we discovered the man who was
Caesar Goddess Julius Caesar

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,670
was born on either the twelfth or
13th of July in the year 100 bce.

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,230
His was a patrician family,

13
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:49,580
which historically had political sway
but was not influential at the time of

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,570
Jesus' birth.

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,190
His Father Gaius was a prenatal
or an elected magistrates,

16
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,380
and it was the governor
of the province of Asia.

17
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:01,340
While his mother or really I belonged
to a family of some prominence.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Seizes on.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,370
Julio was the wife of Gas Marius,

20
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:06,830
who was the leader of the popular faction.

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,880
Political movements.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,220
We don't know very much
about Caesar's childhood,

23
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:14,390
but his education included the study of
the Greek language and he read the works

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,850
of Greek historians in his early teens.

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,420
He began attending lectures
on philosophy and rhetoric,

26
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:23,480
showing a keen interest in developing
his skills as a public speaker.

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,111
At the time,

28
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:27,200
this was something of a
price stability in Rome.

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,380
The Roman forum was the center of
intellectual discussion and debate in Rome

30
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,800
during seasons youth.

31
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,660
It was there that political ideas were
argued out where questions were discussed

32
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:39,680
in elections,

33
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:42,440
held any man who has ambition as a master,

34
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:46,070
the skill of holding the
attention of their audience,

35
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,210
and Julius Caesar,

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,050
he was showing himself to be a
young man of quite some ambition.

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,360
Tragedy struck disease.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,910
A household,

39
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,750
though in 85 ce when Ghia senior died,

40
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:00,320
suddenly the 16 year old Julius
was now the head of the family.

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,130
He inherited this leadership at the very
time that civil war was breaking out

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,020
between the popular faction,

43
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,770
led by his uncle Gaius Marius
and his political rival,

44
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,401
Lucius,

45
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,850
Cordelia Sula after a
bitter and bloody struggle,

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,051
see,

47
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,650
like gains the ascendancy.

48
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,430
Gus,

49
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,670
he was exiled to Africa and
he died shortly thereafter

50
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,730
with similar now in power.

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,530
Those who had ties to Gaius.

52
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,120
Marius were put under pressure,

53
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,270
having married the daughter of a
prominent member of the popular faction,

54
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,340
Cornelia the team sees a.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,900
He became a bit of a target,

56
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,280
see little ordered that he break off
the marriage and distance himself from

57
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,731
Gaius.

58
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:47,731
Marius sees a refused and twist prescribed
by a similar meaning that he was

59
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,480
marked to the executed.

60
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,240
The 18 year old Caesar was
now forced into hiding.

61
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,520
It was only the influence
of his mother's family.

62
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,520
The led to see like lifting
this death sentence still,

63
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,670
Cesar was understandably of Sula.

64
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,521
He decided to do it,

65
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,110
be safe for him to be away from Rome
while Sula road the city sees it now,

66
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,090
set his sights on a military career.

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,700
Initially he served under Marcus Minimus,

68
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,360
thermos.

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,290
He proved to be a natural soldier serving
with distinction in the provinces of

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,200
Asia and Cilicia.

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,530
In 79 BC,

72
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,310
he was awarded the oak leaves of the
civic crown for saving the life of a

73
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:23,080
citizen in the heat of battle.

74
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,190
Things is rising.

75
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:28,840
Military Statute led to him being chosen
as an emissary to the king of the at

76
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,590
Nicodemus in order to exact a
promise for a fleet of ships.

77
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,630
He was successful in its mission,

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,460
how rumors spread that he had only managed
to persuade the gang by agreeing to

79
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,740
something

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,573
defender.

81
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,910
In 78 BC,

82
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:51,180
he died opening the way for season
two to Ryan having left the army.

83
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,960
He began a career as a legal advocate
with his inheritance having been

84
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:56,670
confiscated during the reign of Sila.

85
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,000
He and his wife live a modest lifestyle
and the lower class neighborhoods of

86
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,700
Sabira.

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,940
Three of his legal representations
season began to develop a reputation as a

88
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:09,840
powerful and passionate
public speaker in 75 bce.

89
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,210
While on his way to advance
his studies in Greece,

90
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,020
Caesar was kidnapped by Sicilian
pirates and held for ransom.

91
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,890
It is reputed that when the pirates told
it and they had demanded 20 talents for

92
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:20,580
his release,

93
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,330
he was insulted and insisted that
they increase it to 50 talents.

94
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,510
He was treated well by the pirates
and has a relaxed time with them.

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,970
However,

96
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,180
the the ransom was paid
and he was released.

97
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:33,630
He vowed to them that he would hunt
them down and have them crucified.

98
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,800
He was good to his word raising group of
volunteers and overpowering his former

99
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,740
capitalist prior to their execution,

100
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,760
yet the pirates throats carts as a show
of leniency for having treated him well.

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,690
Shortly after his pirate escapade.

102
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:50,730
Caesar was recalled into military service
he was sending to the province of Asia

103
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,610
and tasked with raising a volunteer
force to put down a rebellion.

104
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,070
Upon successful completion
of this mission,

105
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:59,580
he returned to Rome and was duly
appointed as a military tribune.

106
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,760
It was the first step
of his political career.

107
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,770
Season was not shy about espousing
his support for the popular faction,

108
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:17,220
which had been put down by Sulla years
before he took on the prominent case of a

109
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,180
reigning the governor of
Macedonia dollar Bella,

110
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,410
who had been closely associated with Suda.

111
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,383
When the trial came,

112
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,770
Caesar appeared at the forum,

113
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,250
the force and vigor with which he rated
his argument sweating great public

114
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,140
support in opposing dollar.

115
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,470
Bella sees it was positioning
himself as the people's champion.

116
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,150
He was increasingly being seen as the
natural inheritor of Marius in order to

117
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:42,290
head up the popular faction with Suna
supporters still in the ascendancy,

118
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:42,651
however,

119
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,030
Dolabella was acquitted,

120
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,620
but the case had made Julia Caesar,

121
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:48,440
one of the most conspicuous
men in all of Rome.

122
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,750
Caesar loved the prominence
that he was receiving.

123
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,500
He began to take on the character
of the leader of the Popular Party.

124
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,850
He spoke fluently in the forum both
before assemblies and in the courts of

125
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,570
justice.

126
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,500
It is legal role.

127
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:05,000
He came to specialize in defending those
who were accused of political crimes

128
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,770
through his energy and his boldness,

129
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:10,310
not to mention the strength of logic
and reasoning that he demonstrated.

130
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,540
He became the rising champion of the
people when Caesar's onto the wife of

131
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,920
Marius Julia dive.

132
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,910
He arranged to hold a prominent
funeral for her since the time of the

133
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,920
suppression of our husbands and the potty.

134
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,980
He headed junior,

135
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,230
had lived in obscurity,

136
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,771
in fact,

137
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:28,070
any who associated with were
putting their lives in danger.

138
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,910
Yet the fearless Caesar said there's
a flattering funeral oration from the

139
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,200
rostrum of the forum.

140
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,550
He went as far as condemning the ouster
of his uncle and producing images of

141
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:42,170
Marius for the crowd to see that this
says Patricia partisans in the audience.

142
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,300
They began to objects,

143
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,830
but they were shouted down by the crowd.

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,830
Before long Caesar was delivering
another funeral oration.

145
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,570
This time it was his own wife,

146
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,433
Cornelia,

147
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,660
who had died in delivering the oration.

148
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,020
He made the points of praising a family
who had been prominent members of the

149
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,260
popular family in both funeral oration.

150
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,650
He emphasized the ancient ability of his
family claiming descends from the first

151
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:06,770
king on his mother's side and from
the gods on his father's side.

152
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,540
Following the funeral for his wife,

153
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,000
sees a was appointed as a crestal,

154
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,240
a position which involved performing
financial auditing duties.

155
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,030
He traveled to Spain where he
served as creatorship and 69 bce.

156
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:18,370
It.

157
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,610
It said that while in Spain,

158
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,100
he came across a statue
of Alexander the Great's,

159
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:24,890
which caused him to reflect on
this life's accomplishments.

160
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:25,520
To date,

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,990
he was now 32 the same age at which
Alexander had managed to achieve well

162
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,710
dominance.

163
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,543
In comparison.

164
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,800
He had achieved nothing of significance.

165
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,230
He resolved to change that situation.

166
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,890
Upon returning to Rome,

167
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:44,340
seizes,

168
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,540
prominence and popularity,

169
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:45,781
soar,

170
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:48,690
and being elected to a
succession of public offices.

171
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,250
Then in 67 BC,

172
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:51,690
he was appointed to the Senate.

173
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,441
In that same year,

174
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,930
he married the granddaughter
of Sula Palm Payer.

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,130
The marriage only lasted six years with
Caesar divorcing her when she became

176
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,170
caught up in a damaging political scandal.

177
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,700
In 67 bce,

178
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,610
Caesar was appointed as
a formal magistrates.

179
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,503
Around this time,

180
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,520
it began to engage in the popular custom
of cementing public favor by staging a

181
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,290
lavish entertainment spectacles.

182
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,580
These included games with wildebeests
and gladiators being brought in from all

183
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,390
over the realm.

184
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,070
These extravagant displays serve that
purpose of making a extremely popular with

185
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:23,581
the masses,

186
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:26,880
but they also put a huge
strain on his finances.

187
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,480
In fact,

188
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,920
they punched him into debt.

189
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,060
The only way that you could possibly
extricate himself from his financial woes

190
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,570
was by rising to a
position of ultimate power.

191
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,070
In 63 bce,

192
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:43,020
Caesar set his sights on the position
of Pontifex maximus or chief priest.

193
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,840
He spends even more borrowed money on
popular support and despite being opposed

194
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,300
by two powerful senators,

195
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,580
he won the position
handily the following year.

196
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:55,581
He was appointed as appropriate or pro
magistrate and an area of southern before

197
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,820
you could take up the position.

198
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,390
However,

199
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,830
he was required to settle his
outstanding debts for this,

200
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,030
he turns to one of the city's richest men,

201
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,870
marcus,

202
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,190
the skinniest crassus grasses agreed
to help sees a financially on the basis

203
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,210
that he would in turn,

204
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,970
provide political influence
in [inaudible] favor,

205
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,920
sees now travel to Spain,

206
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:18,240
but he proved to be a
successful administrator you
have to give to both military

207
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,500
and financial success.

208
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,890
We're tending to rhyme with enough
money to pay off all of his debts,

209
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,790
sees a.

210
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,570
He was now in a position to satisfy
sites on the highest political office in

211
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,080
Rome.

212
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
The office of console when the Romans
had gotten rid of their line of kings.

213
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,790
They had vested sea pre magistracy
in the hands of two consoles.

214
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,580
These men were chosen each
year in the general election.

215
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,590
It was left to the people sees,

216
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,650
would have had no problem gaining the
needed votes such while says popularity

217
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:51,310
among them.

218
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,910
However,

219
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,380
there were a number of
influential political rivals
who opposed him at the time.

220
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,270
There was a buser rivalry unfolding
between two men have great influence upon

221
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,090
pay.

222
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,140
Crassus Bombay was a great military leader
while crashes held influenced you to

223
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:08,800
as wealth sees a conceived of the plan
to unite them and they get both of them

224
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:09,850
tobacco in for consult.

225
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,200
He succeeded brilliantly in his plan
managing to create a triumvirate of the

226
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,720
three most influential
politicians in Rome,

227
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,070
each of whom was bound to advance the
political elevation of the others in order

228
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,910
to secure his alliance with Pompei
Caesar arranged for his only daughter,

229
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:25,480
Juliet,

230
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,820
you enter into a marriage alliance.

231
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:30,460
Lance with palm paved with the support
of crisis and Palm Bay behind him.

232
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,920
Caesar set about securing his
appointment to the console.

233
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,761
It's political.

234
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:37,270
Opponents knew that they would be unable
to prevent public support from securing

235
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,470
the console ship for Caesar,

236
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,980
so they set their sights on
preventing seizes preferred console.

237
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,250
A man named Lucius from achieving office.

238
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,740
They put forward bitterness.

239
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:49,500
He was a political opponent
to Caesar for the position,

240
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,710
sees a ambivalence,

241
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,650
were elected co consoles for the 59 bce.

242
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,071
However,

243
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:58,020
Caesar immediately proceeded to ignore
his colleague assuming full power in

244
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,170
carrying out measures unilaterally that
were geared to ingratiate himself with

245
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,830
the People Caesar was opposed by
leading members of the sentence.

246
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,310
One of his famous deponent's
with Keto fervent patriot.

247
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:13,750
He was incensed that Caesar's unilateral
decision making at one point sees the

248
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:17,920
ordered that Keto be taken into custody
and thrown in prison as he was being

249
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:21,730
escorted out by God's another influential
senator rose to accompany him.

250
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,260
When Caesar asked where he was going,

251
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:27,070
he replied to that he would rather be
in prison with Keto than in the Senate.

252
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,510
With Caesar seizes.

253
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:30,460
Control of the console
ship was so complete,

254
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:31,570
so this is supposed to go.

255
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,080
Console,

256
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,290
gave up entirely retiring to his
house and leaving Caesar Free Reign

257
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,800
sees a follow dizzier is consoled by
reimbursing upon his military career by

258
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,300
achieving great military conquest.

259
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,970
He would ensure that his
star rose even higher.

260
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,390
His powerful political allies helped
Caesar secure proconsul ship over three

261
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,960
provinces for an unprecedented
five year governorship.

262
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,030
He became governor of illyricum in the
Balkins Sisyphean goal in northern Italy

263
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,320
and translating goal in southern France
sees this first opportunity for conquest

264
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,350
came when southeastern Gould was invaded
by a tribe known as the Helvetica,

265
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,070
sees a moved against them with six and
agents and crushed them during a fisk

266
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,120
five our battle.

267
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,790
He then turned his attention
to the Germanic tribes.

268
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,340
Despite the formidable
reputation of these warriors,

269
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:28,480
the Roman legions managed to defeat
them at the battle of Valascus.

270
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,130
By 57 bce,

271
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,440
Caesar had built his
army to eight legions,

272
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,360
numbering some 40,000 men.

273
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,050
He knows that channel to subjugate the
Belgrade tribes decimating each one

274
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,390
individually before they
could unite against him.

275
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,640
The final victory came
at the battle of sadness,

276
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:46,090
by which time season it
completely conquered the golf
course with his power now

277
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,100
unquestioned within his own territory,

278
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,950
seasoned now began looking
beyond known borders.

279
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,740
He set his sights on
Germania and pertaining Ya.

280
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,090
In 55 BC,

281
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,250
he built a bridge across
the Rhine in record.

282
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,800
Ten days having it dismantled when he
recrossed after spending 18 days probing

283
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,643
the countryside,

284
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,180
a similar scouting mission was made into
Britannia later that same year in 54

285
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:07,900
BC,

286
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,320
he returns with a full five legions
with the objective of establishing a

287
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:14,920
permanent Raymond base that the Britains
though I had other ideas and they

288
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:18,280
continually harassed the raymonds
with a hit and run attacks strategy.

289
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,730
Still the determination of their leader
and the discipline of their rank and

290
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:22,600
file enabled.

291
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,990
The Romans do systematically
hunt down the local resistance.

292
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,280
And as the Britains sued for peace season,

293
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,950
negotiated an annual tribute,

294
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,300
took a swath of hostages,

295
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,134
and then left.

296
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,540
Never set foot on British soil again.

297
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,950
In 53 BC,

298
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,170
a goldish revolts was quickly put down,

299
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:42,490
but a year later or more determined and
better organized revolt occurred under

300
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,530
the leadership of verse and get direct,

301
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:48,340
say powerful warrior who was determined
to kick the Romans out of goal,

302
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,990
set out to crush the revolt with
a full compliment of 10 legions.

303
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,790
After suffering a number of losses.

304
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,210
Verse and Gatorade switched to a scorched
earth policy that's going to go via

305
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,800
the Romans suffered their first defeat.

306
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,230
There's revenge came swiftly
at the battle of Alicia.

307
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,040
The revolt was crushed and get her ex
was taken alive and transport a jerome

308
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,950
where it was paraded in a
cage like a wild animal.

309
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,330
Then in 47 bce,

310
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:13,840
Caesar embarked on a voyage to Turkey
in order to take care of pharmacies.

311
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:18,010
The seconds it had been extending his
power by over powering a number of

312
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,620
neighboring Roman states
with just three legions,

313
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,100
Caesar went directly to the
town of Zilla to face fantasies.

314

pompey was appointed to the
consult without colleague.

339
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,600

with the ultimate faction
of Arris to crat suit where

340

post to Caesar the following year with
Caesar's military conquest having been

completed.

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,300
The optimists warns him that
if he returned to the room,

343
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,500

consult within the city.

345
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:35,720
They had developed popular factions
in supportive both pompey and Caesar.

346
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,770
The lasses follow his attempted to have
him voted to the console in absentia,

347
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,180
but the opposition demanded that he first
returned to face the music and give up

348
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,510
the commands of his army sees
the bulks at least amounts.

349
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,870
He knew it now that there
was only one recourse.

350
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,890
He had to march on Rome and claim
what he rightfully saw as his.

351

On January the 10th to 49 bce.

352

He marched a single lesion across the
Rubicon River which marked the border of

353
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,090
his province.

354
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,250
This was an immediate active civil war.

355
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:04,790
Yes,

356
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,230
there will be my battle Pompei with
most of his forces deployed in Spain,

357
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,130
fled to the south.

358
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,960
This enabled Caesar's march on Rome on
hindered that he had himself declared

359
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:19,490
dictator with this top general
Mark Anthony as second in
command in short order.

360
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,870
He was elected to the console ship at
which time he resigned his dictatorship

361
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,411
season.

362
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:24,561
Now,

363
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,180
so touts in pursuit of Pompei,

364
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,160
leaving Mark Antony and control of Rome.

365
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,210
My now pumping had established himself
in Greece and was building a four steam

366
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,691
challenge.

367
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,570
Caesar in 48 bce,

368
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,360
the two armies,

369
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,790
Matt's on the plains of fossil.

370
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,430
This with pompey's forces
outnumbering those of of two to one.

371
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:40,821
However,

372
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,700
Caesar one by employing superior tactics,

373
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,240
Pohnpei,

374
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,550
though he managed to escape to Egypt,

375
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,930
sees a pursued palm bay to Alexandria.

376
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,320
There he was supposed to be handed the
head of his adversary who had betrayed

377
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,540
the Egyptians and paid the ultimate price.

378
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,880
Just prior to his arrival in Alexandria,

379
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,780
the joint reload 21 year old Cleopatra
had been driven from the city.

380
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,260
She had a self smuggled in diseases
presence inside a rolled up rug.

381
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,560
She besieged him for assistance
in regaining the throne.

382
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,030
The Raymond Nita saw Cleopatra as a
useful future ally integrated to support

383
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:21,390
that a prolonged Egyptian
siege of Alexandria followed.

384
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,200
Czo ordered the Egyptian fleets to be
burned and managed to hold off a force of

385
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,540
around 20,000 for several months.

386
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,240
He sent a rhyme for reinforcements
and when they turned up,

387
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,640
he marched out to join
them in the ensuing battle.

388
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,440
The Egyptians were defeated.

389
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,010
Cleopatra was installed as Pharaoh and
after spending a further two months

390
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:38,970
enjoying her company,

391
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,370
sees a began fee,

392
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,820
return Jenny to Rome.

393
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,691
On his way back.

394
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:45,150
He even put down a
rebellion in Asia Minor.

395
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,200
During his absence,

396
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,760
things had not gone well in Rome,

397
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,090
largely due to Marc Antony,

398
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,053
ms dot managements,

399
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,900
employing great diplomatic skills.

400
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,930
Season managed to overcome a potential
navy mutiny and put down a rebellion by

401
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:57,864
the optimists

402
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,860
season was now appointed dictator for
10 years at the height of his powers.

403
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,230
And enjoying unprecedented public support.

404
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,880
He ruled autocratically.

405
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,180
This goal is great business among
the senators who we ignored.

406
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,240
Primary among the dissenters
were the two sons of Pompeii,

407
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,920
sexists and miss.

408
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,090
These do headed to Spain,

409
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:25,170
implemented a revolt that
Caesar was forced to travel
to Spain to personally put

410
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,004
down the rebellion.

411
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,230
In February 44 BC,

412
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,510
Caesar was appointed dictator Pettius.

413
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,500
During the ceremony,

414
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,650
he refused to wear the diadem
that Marc Antony handed to him,

415
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,370
stating that Jupiter was the
only for king if the Romans,

416
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,820
Ethan prepared to lead a military
campaign against the Parthians.

417
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,830
Prior to his planned departure from Rome,

418
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,320
Caesar attended a final
meeting of the Senate.

419
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,090
It was on the 15th of March,

420
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,620
44 bce,

421
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,250
unknown disease at 60 of his most bitter
rivals in the centers has come to the

422
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:57,990
meeting with daggers concealed under
that togas Caesar entered the chamber and

423
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,360
proceeded to make his
way to his golden chat.

424
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,250
Other designated signal senators,

425
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:02,550
rules,

426
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,090
directions leapt upon him as the
first dagger blow came down upon him,

427
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,710
Caesar was hard to cry out.

428
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,220
Why this violence to avid
supporters tried to come to his aid,

429
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,760
but they were blocked by the
conspirators within limits,

430
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,890
had been stabbed 23 times.

431
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,270
His final act was to cover his face
with his toga so that none would see his

432
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,104
death expression.

433
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,290
Cesar died at the feet
of a statue of pompey.

434
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,290
The conspirators wanted to throw
his body into the Tiber river,

435
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,150
that they were stopped by Marc Antony.

436
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,070
The announcement that Caesar was dead.

437
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,700
It was met with rioting by the people
and to the conspirators were forced to

438
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:35,851
flee.

439
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,510
The city sees his body was cremated with
the Temple of Caesar being built on the

440
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,410
cremation site.

441
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,370
From that point on,

442
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:45,870
the legend of the martyred Caesar would
be passed down through the centuries.

443
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,700
