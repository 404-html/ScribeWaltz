1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,730
He served in World War
One and World War Two.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,750
He's still one of Germany's most respected
military leaders and yet he never

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,400
even wanted to be in the military.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,480
Who is this man that led the German
troops to victories but defined Hitler at

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,350
his own peril?

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,410
What made him who he is and what
keeps his name and the history books?

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:16,741
Well,

8
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,880
that's what we're looking
at in today's biographics,

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,610
the life of Erwin Rommel,

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,230
the Desert Fox

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,660
hold in Germany in 1891 oh when Rommel
half have the military in his DNA.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,170
His father was a teacher and he was the
only member of his family to enter the

13
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,460
military as a career.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,800
Obvious three siblings
that live to adulthood.

15
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,471
At one brother,

16
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,030
it became a dentist and other became an
opera singer and his sister became an

17
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,740
art teacher as a child role,

18
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,300
wasn't particularly athletic.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,901
In fact,

20
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,700
he's even been described as frail,

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,300
but he hit his stride and his early
teens discovering sports and becoming a

22
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,560
leader among his peers.

23
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,820
Around this same time,

24
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:02,150
he also discovered his love of
mathematics and engineering.

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,740
He built his own glider and was known
to spend his free time taking apart

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,700
machinery and putting
it back together again,

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,750
a teenage rumble,

28
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,100
even dismantles and entire motorcycle
and rebuilt this now Robel he was clearly

29
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:13,701
intelligent,

30
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:14,630
but his grades,

31
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,060
they didn't reflect it
without good grades.

32
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,720
Rommel couldn't continue his education
at university with his talent for

33
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,320
machinery.

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,840
He considered working at a
factory near his childhood home,

35
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,390
but his father didn't
want him working that.

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,961
Instead,

37
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,540
his father pushed grumble
into military service.

38
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,620
At the age of 18 Rommel began studying it.

39
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,380
The officer Cadet School in Tokyo was
part of the 124 for Wurtenburg infantry

40
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:36,950
regiments.

41
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,820
He graduated in 1911 and by January
of 1912 was commissioned as second

42
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,700
lieutenants as a battery commander.

43
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,220
He became part of the 124
for Weingarten regiments.

44
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,680
He showed his military talent early on.

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,910
He was still a young men and it's no
surprise the rumble has more going on in

46
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,860
his life than just his military service.

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,120
Rommel had met a young woman by the name
of Walburga stenner while he was posted

48
00:01:59,121 --> 00:01:59,670
in wine.

49
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,710
Gotten the two began and romance and wild
bagger rented up pregnant when rubble

50
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,790
the ends of her pregnancy.

51
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,240
You promised that they would marry and
live in a house and be a family before

52
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:08,841
they could marry.

53
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,870
Very wild dog gave birth to her
daughter that she named to Gertrude.

54
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,740
Months later,

55
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,720
Rommel stationed away from Weingarten
sent well bag or a letter the contained

56
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,040
far different news than what she expected.

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,620
The lesser broke the news
that he couldn't marry her.

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,460
She wasn't from the right class to be
an officer's wife and was Korea was his

59
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,294
priority.

60
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,240
Then there was the fact that he was
also in love with another woman.

61
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,310
The other woman was at Lucy Mollin.

62
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,203
She and Matt,

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,470
while he was in cadet school,

64
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,180
though they did not marry until 1916
rumbles a clear commitment to Lucy did not

65
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,740
stop Walberg out from loving him,

66
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,560
though she stayed
devoted to him for years,

67
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:45,260
believing that as long as he never
had children with another woman,

68
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,370
that was a chance that
he would return to her,

69
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,620
but he never did.

70
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,460
In 1928 Walburga lands that Lucy
was pregnant with Rommel's trials,

71
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,110
unable to deal with the news.

72
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,130
She killed herself.

73
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,240
Rommel and Lucy were supportive of
Gertrude both financially and emotionally.

74
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,940
They welcome time into their home.

75
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,630
They did introduce her as their niece
when Lawler was fighting in Africa.

76
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,260
The scarf that he wore was knitted for
him by Gertrude Rommel and Lucy's own

77
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:08,561
son,

78
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:08,821
man.

79
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:13,360
Fred was born in 1928 and even went
on to become mayor of Stuttgart for 20

80
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,194
years.

81
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,850
That's almost family
life was taking shape,

82
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:23,580
so was his military career months after
his illegitimate daughter was born in

83
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,351
world war one,

84
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:25,220
broke out role,

85
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:29,170
began his war service as a
platoon commander in Verdun
where he soon established

86
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:32,120
the fearlessness that he became
known for only a month into the war.

87
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:35,330
He'd charge degree for French
soldiers with a banner ads on his own.

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,930
He had no ammunition but the
French troops did rumble.

89
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:38,810
It was shot in the leg,

90
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,710
but this was only to be the first of many
injuries that he sustained during his

91
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:43,700
military service.

92
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,500
Rommel was so well known for charging.

93
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,900
It had an ending up in the thick of this,

94
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,980
this his trips used to see where Rommel
is there as the front [inaudible] served

95
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:52,431
in France,

96
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:52,821
Romania,

97
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,290
and SLE during World War One.

98
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,570
He was not only respected for his courage,

99
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,650
for his leadership and implementing new
strategies and maneuvers for warfare.

100
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,670
One of rumbles,

101
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,570
most exceptional victories came as he
led troops in the mountainous region of

102
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,740
Kappa rata in Italy.

103
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,920
Rommel streets where polyphasic
conditions were horrific,

104
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,560
but with the use of new
infiltration tactics.

105
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,670
The German Nan Austro-hungarian troops
had a decisive victory over the Italian

106
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:17,330
army.

107
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,470
9,000 Italian men were
captured 150 of them offices,

108
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:21,880
Rommel.

109
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,560
It didn't achieve this
by following orders.

110
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,201
It's quite the contrary.

111
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:24,830
In fact,

112
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,300
when he was told to stand down,

113
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,860
he moved forward and attacked.

114
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,490
He also used a strategy you have
coming out the attacks from surprising

115
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:36,320
directions and creating confusion and
disorder among the Italian trips for his

116
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:37,220
role in the battle,

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,780
Rommel received the Paul and Mary.

118
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:41,120
It's a prestigious German Order of merit.

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,320
Even before his achievements of the
Battle of Cup Hereso Rommel has earns the

120
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,050
iron cross and had been
promoted to first lieutenant.

121
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,580
In 1918 he received another promotion
to captain when World War One ended.

122
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,840
Rommel stayed in the military,

123
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,460
leaving the 30th infantry regiment and
still got most of the work involved

124
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,780
dealing with civil unrest,

125
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,020
but Rommel didn't use the same aggressive
tactics he was known for in the

126
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,770
battlefields.

127
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,320
In fact,

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,630
the avoided using force as much as he
could and negotiations took the place of

129
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:11,900
action in the town of Lindau
rather than attack the communists,

130
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,590
he was staging an uprising and the town
rumble used to diplomacy to get the

131
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:19,340
cities governments back under
control recognized for his leadership

132
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,031
capabilities.

133
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:23,660
Rommel was sooner pointed to two
teeth Shanthi Dresden infantry school.

134
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,680
Among the advice a Lawford future
military leaders is this advice that he

135
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:29,350
followed in his own military career.

136
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,080
Be an example to your men and your
duty hand in your private life.

137
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,010
Never spare yourself and let the troops
see that you don't in your endurance and

138
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,240
fatigue and privation.

139
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,770
Always be tactful and well mannered and
teach your subordinates to do the same.

140
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,470
Avoid excessive sharpness
or harshness of voice,

141
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,580
which usually indicates the man who has
shortcomings of his own to hide during

142
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:53,690
this time at Rommel also said to work
putting his military strategies on paper.

143
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,110
In 1934 Rommel Oseberg on
infantry training was published.

144
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,220
He was no longer teaching having left
that role in 1933 but he was leading

145
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,330
troops in gossip.

146
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,110
It was in Gossler that he encountered
at off it and for the first time Hitler

147
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,750
was chancellor and he was in
Gosselaar to inspect troops.

148
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,600
By 1937 Hitler was well
aware of Ronald Man,

149
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,434
his reputation.

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,393
He names Rommel,

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,500
the war ministry liaison
for the Hitler youth,

152
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,840
but Rommel was not a
member of the Nazi party.

153
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,890
He ends another hit.

154
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,000
The youth leader disagreed about tactics
and organization for the group and in

155
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:23,451
the end,

156
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,920
rumble lost his role in 1938 even though
Rommel wasn't a member of the Nazi

157
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,340
party,

158
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,100
he was still a supporter of
Hitler during his rise to power.

159
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,570
He did agree with Hitler's efforts to
re militarize and do unify Germany and

160
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,510
Hitler still wanted Rommel in the
upper echelons of the military.

161
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,051
In fact,

162
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,410
he made a direct request that rubble
will be part of the units that traveled

163
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,060
with Hitler.

164
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,770
The assignment not only gave
Rommel access to the fear,

165
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,580
but it also gave him more free time for
his hobbies and interests than he had

166
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,420
ever had before.

167
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,080
He wants again,

168
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,520
started focusing on math and engineering
and even took time away to go skiing,

169
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,920
but this wasn't a loss because war,

170
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,540
it was just around the corner.

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,510
1939 was a watershed year for Europe and
it's the wells under Hitler's orders.

172
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,200
Germany invaded Poland on September the
first 1939 as part of the preparation

173
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,011
for the invasion,

174
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:17,670
Rommel had been promoted to major
general and was entrusted with protecting

175
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,180
Hitler as war erupts says.

176
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,250
Then in 1940 Ronald was put in charge
of the seventh Panzer Division,

177
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,920
the Panzer divisions
made up of armored tanks.

178
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,191
Well,

179
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:30,140
an ideal opportunity for rumble to put
his particular strategic skill set on

180
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,810
display.

181
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,010
Initially plans were for rum olds who
heads up a mountain division first.

182
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,840
With the support Rommel was able to
land at the head of the division.

183
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:39,140
He wants it in addition to armored tanks.

184
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,670
Rommel was also leading rifle regiments,

185
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,770
a motorcycle battalion as an engineer.

186
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:44,560
The Talia,

187
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,750
Andy was doing this out of the usual order
of military protocol when Hitler made

188
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,560
Romola General.

189
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,680
He bypassed other more
experienced military men to do so.

190
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,680
This started some grumblings
within the German military,

191
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,860
but Rommel assume proved himself
to be worthy off the rank.

192
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,760
He puts his division through their
training pieces for months and in May they

193
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,290
sat off for battle and France.

194
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:04,951
The battle,

195
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,140
it didn't start out well
for ramen and an air strips.

196
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,500
Bridges were out where they needed to
cross a river and it's the French were

197
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:11,011
firing,

198
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,920
stopping the German troops
from making attempts to cross,

199
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,750
but Rommel outsmarted them.

200
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,050
He's our building's on fire creating a
wall of smoke that gave it strips the

201
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:22,500
cover they needed as they fired her
back across the river at the French.

202
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,890
They then got in rubber boots and
made their way across the water using

203
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,750
materials from another panzer division.

204
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:31,230
They built a bridge and the full
division moved across Rommel.

205
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,300
He wasn't standing back and giving orders.

206
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,660
No.

207
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,710
The general was actually in the thick
of the action firing a machine gun and

208
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:40,320
even wading into the water
to put the bridge together.

209
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,190
Once again,

210
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,990
Ramos Division made quick progress.

211
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:47,550
Within days they captured 10,000 French
soldiers and only lost three doesn't

212
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:48,384
have their own men.

213
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,433
For this victory,

214
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,420
Rommel was awarded the Knight's cross.

215
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,381
In the coming weeks.

216
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,480
Rommel continues has
advanced across France.

217
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,010
He announced success is to had learned
a telegram containing only four words.

218
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,570
I'm on the coast.

219
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,690
Throughout the seventh panzer
divisions move across France.

220
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,800
Rumble moved his trips so quickly in
surreptitiously that even the German high

221
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,330
command couldn't keep track of them.

222
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,260
This led them to debates the
ghost division off to the
gentleman's march through

223
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:13,681
France,

224
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,730
the stories a Roosevelt,

225
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,421
Rommel shooting,

226
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,640
an unarmed French prison off
and not following orders.

227
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,480
He's also been accused of involvement in
the massacre of French African soldiers

228
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:25,290
from Senegal and men under his command
were involved in the killing of dozens of

229
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,370
men who are surrendering and therefore
posed no threat to the German soldiers.

230
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,730
While some of his troops were very
likely involved in such a trustee's,

231
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,720
historians believe rumble would not have
given commands for such brutal attacks.

232
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,000
According to historian Rafael Shack,

233
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,010
although there is no
evidence incriminating,

234
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:45,510
Rama themself is unit did find in areas
where German massacres of black French

235
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,520
prisoners of war were extremely common.

236
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,260
In June,

237
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,240
1940 after the gym Taiko for France,

238
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,580
the plan it was at first for
Ronald's to had to Britain.

239
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,370
That would be the next nation
the Germany would take over.

240
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,820
But it was decided that the German air
force wasn't strong enough to do what

241
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,510
needed to be done in order to take over
England's and instead Rommel was sent to

242
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,344
Africa.

243
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,550
The Afrika Korps was a newly
created division of the
German military and General

244
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,740
Rummel was the man who
led it to victories.

245
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,550
The Italians had been suffering crushing
losses in northern Africa and Hitler

246
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,410
wanted the Germans there to beat back.

247
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,060
The British royal arrived in the in 1941
and he was supposed to answer to the

248
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,920
Italian commanding military officer,

249
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,380
but he disagreed with
the Italians tactics.

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
They wanted the Italian and German
troops to use a defensive strategy.

251
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,550
Rommel wanted to advance and take
on with the British directly.

252
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,580
Hedler agreed with Rommel man's
Rommel began planning an offensive.

253
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,031
The British,

254
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:36,480
however,

255
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,010
had no idea that was the plan.

256
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,410
The only intelligence
was the rumbles orders,

257
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,670
where to stay put.

258
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,590
When Romo moved districts forward,

259
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,860
they were caught a well off guard,

260
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,530
rumbles slimer nuvaring.

261
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,420
It's proved fruitful for him once again,

262
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,250
but even with success,

263
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,740
the Italian lead a
Garibaldi was not happy.

264
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,151
Rommel,

265
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:55,680
her disobeyed orders and
then matter the outcome.

266
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,710
That was not the way the
military was supposed to work.

267
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,380
However,

268
00:10:59,380 --> 00:10:59,860
Rommel,

269
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,410
he had a response for Garibaldi value.

270
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,401
One can often,

271
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:06,180
they're two unique opportunities to sit
by for the sake of trifles outside of

272
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:06,630
Germany.

273
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,090
Rummel was capturing the
attention of world leaders.

274
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,940
Winston Churchill was 90 water.

275
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,970
What else matters?

276
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,110
But beating him,

277
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,470
but the nickname he owns it.

278
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,300
His clandestine maneuverings in Africa
is what a stuck through the decades of

279
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,080
history,

280
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,120
and I would be the Desert Fox,

281
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,260
but its successes.

282
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,220
They came to an ends.

283
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,220
The British recaptured,

284
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,180
the city of Tobruk and
rumbles games had been lost.

285
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,630
Then rumble was part of a crucial
meeting with Hitler Ins and other German

286
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,960
military leader elders,

287
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,760
Castle ring,

288
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,780
the two field marshals.

289
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,090
They disagreed and how the
Germans should move forward.

290
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,930
Initially they presented their arguments
and Hitler agreed with castle ring.

291
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,770
Gasser ring took over and Rommel was moved
to do need the troops on the coast of

292
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,520
France.

293
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,380
By the time Romo was reassigned to France,

294
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,140
he was starting to be more
and more skeptical of Hitler.

295
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,420
His strategies and his goals are almost,

296
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,010
didn't support the brutal actions,

297
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,920
the SS,

298
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,430
and eventually you came to believe that
Germany would be better off negotiating

299
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,000
an end to the war instead of continuing
the carnage and all the death,

300
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,160
and he wasn't alone in his beliefs.

301
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,810
A group of men who agreed with Rommel,

302
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,960
even suggested that he should
become Geminis new leader.

303
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,450
Though Rommel didn't
act on that suggestion,

304
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,550
the mere fact of the suggestion ultimately
helped seal rumbles face from the

305
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,290
time he was in charge of coastal forces.

306
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,910
In 1943 Rommel spent his time and
strategy building up coastal defenses.

307
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,710
He says mine's built barbed
wire obstructions and even
had troops flood areas of

308
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,720
the coast to make it
harder for trips to pass.

309
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:31,900
Three he also wanted to bring
more tanks closer to the coast,

310
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,270
better.

311
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,330
No one else agreed with them
that that was necessary.

312
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,250
In the summer of 1944 it would
turn out to there's Rommel,

313
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,631
well,

314
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,090
he was riced wants to move
more tanks to the coast.

315
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,000
On June the fifth 1944 Rummel left France.

316
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,150
He headed home to Germany so that he
could be with his wife on her birthday.

317
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,400
June the sixth when he left France,

318
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,520
he and the rest of the German military
thought the weather would be bad and they

319
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,330
didn't have to worry about any allied
movements on the coast and they also

320
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:56,830
thought that if any trouble was to come,

321
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:57,670
it would be a Kelly,

322
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,620
but the allies had used
the German military is weak
intelligence system to get

323
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,870
them to think that the
attack would come at Cali.

324
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,450
While he was a time celebrating
his wife's birthday,

325
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,370
Rommel received a phone
call that shocked him.

326
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,890
The allies had landed at
Normandy on June the SEC.

327
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,470
The weather had cleared and
the trips were storming.

328
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,620
The beaches rumbled left Germany
immediately to hand to the front.

329
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,290
He and other leaders establish
to counter attack plan,

330
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,610
but I live fire was too strong and
needed troops when table to arrive.

331
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,730
Rommel himself was injured badly by
allied air strikes and the ends 155,000

332
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,360
allied troops landed during the d day
invasion growing to 1 million after the

333
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,194
initial push,

334
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,430
the fourth stormed through German
defenses during the summer of 1944 it's a

335
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:42,850
rumble.

336
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,120
It was clear that jam and he couldn't
overcome the losses and so you continued

337
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,500
forward march of the allies.

338
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,860
He broke the news of his assessment to
hit not telling him the tape political

339
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,900
solution was likely the best way forward.

340
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,734
At this point,

341
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,250
the fear,

342
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,910
though he did not agree this meeting
would ultimately be the lost between the

343
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:01,300
two men as victory for Germany
was looking less and less likely,

344
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,400
opposition to Hitler
was growing in Germany.

345
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,960
High ranking military officials,

346
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,200
including those close to Rommel where
it's starting to make plans to get rid of

347
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,950
the Fiera assassination was among
the many options they contemplated.

348
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,000
Knowing Rommel disagreed with Hitler.

349
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,080
Runs was growing increasingly upset
with the fear of the men plotting to

350
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:17,561
overthrow.

351
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,450
Hitler tried to bring him into the fault.

352
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,140
To this day,

353
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,921
it's unclear ref.

354
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:23,790
Rommel was actually involved in a
plot to assassinate Hitler on us,

355
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,060
and if he was,

356
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,890
it's unclear just how much he knew.

357
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,270
His widow later said,

358
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,810
Rommel only wanted Hitler to be
brought to court and it's nothing more.

359
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,240
If you're a though he fought to,

360
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,701
there's a rumble,

361
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:36,250
wanted him dead and in the
end that's what matters.

362
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,140
I'm July 20th,

363
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,800
1944 a group of conspirators smuggled a
bomb inside the briefcase into a meeting

364
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,320
at Hitler's headquarters that
was supposed to be two bombs,

365
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,410
but there was only time to prepare
one and two when it exploded.

366
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,320
The survived instead of a successful key
with the conspirators found themselves

367
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:54,920
facing treason charges and the death
penalty and Rommel was among those

368
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,754
indicators.

369
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,010
In October,

370
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,670
1944 two or fitness generals confronted
rumble as ss troops surrounded the area.

371
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,910
The generals told Rommel that he had
three options and you could go to speak to

372
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:11,600
Hitler directly and explain himself and
he could go to court or he could commit

373
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:12,530
suicide there.

374
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:13,710
And then Rommel,

375
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,060
Molly opted for suicide in his
final communication with his wife.

376
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,850
He explains why in view
of my services in Africa,

377
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,800
I have the chance of dying by poison.

378
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,390
Two generals have brought it with them.

379
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,670
It is fatal in three seconds.

380
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,750
If I take the poison,

381
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,270
none of the usual steps will
be taken against my family.

382
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,830
That is against you.

383
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,810
They will also leave my staff alone.

384
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,880
Having explained to his
family what was to happen,

385
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,560
Ron more got into an ss car.

386
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,780
He took the Sinai Capsi,

387
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:40,130
all that Hitler's general
had brought and he died.

388
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,270
He was wearing his Africa corps jacket
and carrying his field marshal's baton.

389
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,200
The world was told he died of wounds he
had sustained from allied air attacks in

390
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:49,070
the wake of d day,

391
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,150
and he was buried with full military
honors only after the war did the truth

392
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,960
emerge.

393
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,780
Rommel was not maps with the
same disdain from world leaders.

394
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:59,060
There's other Germans were
in the wake of World War II.

395
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,400
Even Winston Churchill
spoke highly of him.

396
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,060
He also deserves our respect because
although a loyal German soldier,

397
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,500
he came to hate him and all his works
and took part in the conspiracy to rescue

398
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,980
Germany by displacing the
maniac and tyrants for this,

399
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,990
you paid the forfeit of his life,

400
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,400
uh,

401
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,970
when Rommel was a talented leader,

402
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,200
but his military duty survey regime that
had terrible intentions and committed

403
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,580
horrific atrocities were almost life and
death were intertwines with a watershed

404
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,930
era in human history.

405
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,360
An era upon which he left his mark.

406
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,860
So really have you found that video?

407
