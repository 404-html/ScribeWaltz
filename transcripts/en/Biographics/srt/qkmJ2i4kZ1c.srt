1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,620
He has come down through history
as America's first serial killer,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,500
the incarnation of pure evil.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,740
He was the first of a new
breed of American celebrity,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,491
the handsome,

5
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:11,270
debonair,

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,290
superintelligence mass murderer is
legends fields by his own insatiable

7
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:15,740
appetite,

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,670
for exaggeration,

9
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:17,990
would turn him into a monster.

10
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,140
The arch fiends of the age
and the greatest criminal
of this expiring century is

11
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:23,511
murder.

12
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,590
Castle situated at the heart of the
world's greatest exhibition was reputedly.

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,050
The scene of unspeakable horror is yes.

14
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,400
The truth about Dr. h Dot h Holmes is
far removed from the sensationalism that

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,420
surrounds his name.

16
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,380
No one did more to turn the gossip
into legend than Holmes himself,

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,190
which makes it all the more difficult
to get the truth about the devil in the

18
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:44,024
white city.

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,650
I was born with a devil in me.

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,580
I could not help the fact that I was a
murderer more than a poet's can help the

21
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,900
inspiration to sing

22
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,940
who

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,850
would come to call himself.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,970
Henry Howard homes was born
with a far less impressive name,

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,600
and that was webster
mudget on the 16th of May,

26
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:13,961
18,

27
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,910
61 in Gill Manson,

28
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:16,744
New Hampshire.

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,591
By all accounts,

30
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:21,310
his parents were upright and respectable
people with the child's upbringing,

31
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,690
being pretty unremarkable.

32
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,210
Laser stories that his father
was a violent alcoholic.

33
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,310
He would smother his
children with chloroform,

34
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,580
so handkerchiefs to you,

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,590
teach them a lesson.

36
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,400
Are the results of a newspaper
writers overactive imagination?

37
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:33,920
Yeah.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,920
There is one incident in his youth which
clearly did have a profound impact on

39
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,880
his later life when he was about 13,

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,540
two older boys dragged them
into the local doctor's office.

41
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,201
I play Simon,

42
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,860
was terrified of because of the various
tales had been told about body parts

43
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,120
lying around the place.

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,170
The bullies brought the terrified by
face to face with a human skeleton,

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,090
but rather than frightening him,

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,953
human bones,

47
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,400
they fascinated the trials,

48
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,510
this fascination.

49
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,120
It grew into an adult
desire to study medicine,

50
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,070
homes out another really fascination,

51
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,500
and that was with women by the age of 16.

52
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,740
He was working odd jobs when he fell
head over heels in love with a beautiful

53
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:12,100
young woman by the name
of fire and the mets,

54
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:15,940
Clara while working on her father's farm
soon after they were both at a church.

55
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,170
Social Clara though,

56
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,740
while she was flirting with another boy,

57
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,860
and this made young Herman see reds,

58
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,090
he promptly marched.

59
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:25,000
Every other boy bands threatened to
punch his lights out if he didn't.

60
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,320
Gala last well,

61
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,780
this thing to impress
young Clara with Herman,

62
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,700
escorting her home arm in arm.

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,570
The next day.

64
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,000
He was telling everyone
that they were engaged.

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,431
The two,

66
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:38,140
both 17 years of age at the time were
married by a justice of the peace on

67
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:38,951
fourth of July,

68
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:39,341
18,

69
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:41,740
78 for the first six
months of the marriage.

70
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,520
It was kept a secret with a couple living
apart with their parents when it was

71
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:49,300
finally revealed farlands mother or Riley
commented she couldn't have done much

72
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:53,890
worse and we'll probably have to support
you as father arranged for her to work

73
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:56,380
in his brother's grocery
store in east concourse.

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,370
Nine months later,

75
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,160
Clara she gave birth
to a son named Robert.

76
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,300
Becoming a father.

77
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,240
Seems to have inspired him in because
he was interested in medicine.

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,690
He quit the store on Wednesday to take
up an apprenticeship under Dr. Right.

79
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,380
The owner of the office in which had
been introduced to the skeleton six years

80
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,214
previously,

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
ballroom and the baby went
to live with our parents.

82
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:24,901
Yeah.

83
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:28,440
The budding medical took up more
formal studies at the medical school in

84
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,041
Burlington,

85
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,760
Vermont.

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,570
During this time.

87
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,640
He conducted himself as a single man.

88
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,181
In fact,

89
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,820
he carried on a relationship with
the daughter of his landlord.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Lives became so passionate that
people thought they were engaged.

91
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,620
When Hammond's remade,

92
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,540
Fred ingles revealed to the girl's father,

93
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,710
but he was already married.

94
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,080
The two time that lead a thrashing on
Ingolstadt left him with a black eye and

95
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,110
scratched face.

96
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,130
Darker than this though was the fact that
the wife of the owner of the boarding

97
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:56,700
house once noticed a foul smell emanating
from Herman's room on investigating.

98
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,730
She was horrifying to find
a dead baby under his bed.

99
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,200
His explanation was that
had been experimenting with
dissections is part of his

100
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,063
homework.

101
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,230
Herman was warms.

102
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:10,650
Do never bring dead bodies into the house
again it to how many wins an audit to

103
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,110
study at the University
of Michigan at this time,

104
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,550
he took his wife and son with him,

105
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,690
but the marriage,

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,460
while it was already on shaky grounds,

107
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,990
other residents of the boarding house,

108
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:22,560
but they live in later records that
the couple often quarrels with Clara

109
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,420
frequently sporting black eyes.

110
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,400
At some point cholera.

111
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,130
Mr decided she had enough because she
returns home with her baby then marriage.

112
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:29,341
Well,

113
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:30,390
it was effectively over,

114
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:34,260
but this would never be formalized now
on infested by family home and threw

115
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,430
himself into his studies.

116
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,450
He was particularly fascinated with
the dissection of human bodies.

117
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:39,931
Nothing,

118
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:43,470
nothing more than the country's Wayne's
of flesh and pull out body organs.

119
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,910
One small and he took to
taking home infant corpses
to work on during the spring

120
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,120
break.

121
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,600
This fellow students remembered that
harmon's fascination with dissection.

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,080
Well,

123
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
it was unnatural mender nerving,

124
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,020
but then there's the question of whether
or not Hammond participated in a ruse

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,840
of faking someone's death in order to
collect insurance money and is very

126
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:01,261
dubious.

127
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,011
Autobiography.

128
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,610
He claims that he and his medical
student pals spoke of the idea but never

129
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,910
actually did it and given his
pension for self exaggeration,

130
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:13,110
it seems unlikely he would have been shy
about revealing this v one scandal from

131
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:13,861
his college days,

132
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,800
which can be substantiated
as involves not surprisingly,

133
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,870
are women though still married to Clara.

134
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,180
He began courting the women
in his boarding house.

135
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:22,014
He resided.

136
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,460
He had promised to marry her.

137
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,210
The new women found the letter in
his room that was signed by his wife.

138
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,560
This certainly shocked to women,

139
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,790
but she should have counted ourselves.

140
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,490
We're lucky at least she
didn't find a dead baby.

141
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,400
Nevertheless,

142
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,050
the women complained to the medical
school faculty citing breach of promise.

143
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,530
Payment appeared at a hearing and themes
that woman was lying and that he never

144
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:41,490
promised to marry her heart.

145
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,940
The faculty believed him
and he was acquitted.

146
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,190
A few months later on being
handed his graduation diploma,

147
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:51,080
though harmon approached his professor
and said Dr. focused things that women

148
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,450
said about me on twitter

149
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,950
after graduating and lived with his
family back in New Hampshire during the

150
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,783
summer.

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,671
That wasn't.

152
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:11,240
He began working as both a physician
and a school teacher in New York.

153
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,931
During this time,

154
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,840
he gains a reputation as a
debt default and a womanizer.

155
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,650
He proposed marriage to to more women
that with the latter mini Everett's

156
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,020
backing out with a prophetic reflection,

157
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,590
there is something lacking in that
man's character that time will reveal.

158
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,670
I do not like him.

159
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,010
I firmly believe that
he would commit murder.

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,550
Herman also acquired a
reputation as a swindler.

161
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,800
He wouldn't use any number of excuses
to get out of paying his rent.

162
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,251
In the end,

163
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,370
he left town in the middle of the night
in order to escape a mountain of debt,

164
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,520
even swindled the price of
his train ticket out of town.

165
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,050
It was may of 18,

166
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:45,380
66 and that swindled train
ticket and taken him to Chicago.

167
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,100
It was his intention to
find work in a drug store,

168
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,000
but he needed a pharmacy license.

169
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:50,990
In order to do that.

170
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,990
You went to Springfield and
sat a three day examination.

171
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,670
It was subsequently announced in the
press that Harry h homes passed the bar.

172
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,270
This announcement is it marks the first
time that the home's alias was used,

173
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,430
why he chose to call himself Harry Howard.

174
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,990
Homes is still unknown,

175
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,310
contrary to what many people think.

176
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,720
It's not a nod to sherlock holmes,

177
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,150
Conan Doyle's most famous creation would
not appear for yet another year almost

178
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,310
christened as new name by becoming
a big ernest on the way to Chicago.

179
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,940
He spent time in Minneapolis where he
took up with and then married a young

180
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,700
woman named Mirta belknap.

181
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,540
That's where she was rather plain looking,

182
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,330
but her parents had money and
that was enough for homes.

183
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,980
Shortly after moving to Chicago,

184
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,981
he used this wealth to purchase a parcel
of land on what was then 701 to 700 and

185
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:33,741
360,

186
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,000
third street and Englewood.

187
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,210
He had ownership but in zoo,

188
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:36,981
his wife's name,

189
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,210
and then into that if our mother,

190
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,960
in order to keep the credit as a bay
almost mythology tells us that the bad

191
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,540
doctor needled his way into
the employers are bedridden.

192
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,790
Pharmacist named e s Holton,

193
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,560
who's young wife was run off our feet,

194
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,210
operating the business by herself.

195
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,870
Homes was hard to take over the operation
and shortly thereafter the couple

196
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:57,380
disappeared with the implication
here being that homes murdered them,

197
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,410
but this isn't at all the
reality of the situation.

198
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,070
Instead,

199
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,620
Dr. yes,

200
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,150
Holton,

201
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,870
whereas actually the wife or husband's
rather than being on his deathbed was a

202
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:07,100
robust longshoreman.

203
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,430
Dr Olsen's are on homes and found
him to be and the ideal asset for the

204
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,030
business.

205
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,370
When she became pregnant
with our second child in 18,

206
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:13,970
87,

207
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,570
she decided to sell the pharmacy
to homes rather than disappearing.

208
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,110
The holtons both lived well into the
20th century remaining in these same

209
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:21,680
neighborhoods.

210
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,070
That whole time the pharmacy
business became a great success,

211
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,970
becoming especially popular with young
women who came from afar to be served by

212
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:29,720
the charming,

213
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
handsome new doctor,

214
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,540
honestly begins eating on assistants who
were invariably a nubile young beauties

215
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,030
who were flocking to Chicago by the train.

216
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,081
At the same time,

217
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:42,050
homes turns his attention to the vacant
lot that he owned on the same street as

218
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:46,220
the pharmacy plan to construct a two
story building with retail space on the

219
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,120
first floor and residential
apartments on these seconds.

220
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,080
The building had some unusual features.

221
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,470
There was a hidden compartment between
the first and second floors along with a

222
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:58,110
staircase between floors and that could
only be reached from a trapdoor in the

223
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,150
second story buffering far more
troubling than these designed quacks,

224
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,560
however,

225
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,420
was the fact that Holmes refused to pay
his bills when the build is I've never

226
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,840
iron and steel sued in 18.

227
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,710
80 eight homes,

228
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,040
claimed at the team wasn't liable because
the building was actually owned by his

229
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,790
mother in law when the building company
lies began to chronicle his involvement

230
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,450
in the project homes alleged event,

231
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,810
one of the steel beams
provided was too short,

232
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,000
which negated the entire contract.

233
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,720
Defending himself in court apparently
did nothing to dwindle his passion for

234
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,470
swindling.

235
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,890
His favorite trick was buying goods on
credit and then selling them for cash and

236
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,510
not paying the original bill.

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,281
In one case,

238
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,790
he purchased in this specialty heavy,

239
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,660
safe on credit and had it installed on
the first floor of his new building.

240
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,280
Having balls bells around that.

241
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,190
When the repossession agents
came knocking homes replied,

242
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
go ahead and take the safe,

243
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,000
but I warn you not to damage the building.

244
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,040
They're repossessing as
they struggled for hours.

245
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,280
Finally realizing that they couldn't
get it out without tearing down a wall.

246
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,310
They have no choice but to leave
the safe exactly where it was.

247
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,620
The people who worked for homes single
use to is quirky ways he wants invited to

248
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,310
work at do you step inside the safe and
start yelling when homes close the door

249
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,990
in order to test if it was soundproof,

250
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,560
his housekeeper would also regularly
catch tip toeing around at night and the

251
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:19,100
janitor who worked at the pharmacy
records a time when homes showed him a

252
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,490
collection of fake beards
and other discussions,

253
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:22,520
is it 1990,

254
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,300
almost decided to sell the drugstore
business in order to focus on real estate.

255
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,360
Unsurprisingly,

256
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,270
the salads and into another swindle.

257
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,040
After the new owner took possession,

258
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,460
he was shocked to find that much of the
floor stock had not been paid for with

259
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:38,780
repossession agents claiming them back
still somehow managed to talk his way out

260
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:39,530
of this struggle.

261
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,010
In fact,

262
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,210
even though he no longer
owns the drugstore,

263
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,190
he still spent a lot of time there.

264
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
He just so happened to be on hands.

265
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:49,100
One day when one of the new investors
showed up with important information to

266
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:52,640
share the mend and inexplicably
collapsed right outside the drug store.

267
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,960
Holmes was the first one to aside pouring
a dark liquids down the man's throat.

268
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,700
Within minutes he was debt.

269
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,150
This was likely the first person to
die at bands of Dr Holmes killed,

270
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,350
likely because he knew too
much about the magic magic,

271
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,060
although we'll never really know what
that information he had was in July of 18,

272
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:13,061
89 homes employed a young couple conant
who worked in the pharmacy and lived on

273
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:16,460
the second floor of the recently
completed anglewood building.

274
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,480
Within a month,

275
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,220
pons and Julia were engaged in a fat
even as myrtle lived under the same roof.

276
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,150
This understandably drove a wedge between
the couple with ned filing for divorce

277
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,500
and quitting homes as employee.

278
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,990
Julia now started doing
tango herself in homes.

279
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,530
There's financial web enlisted our
whereas the cofounder of a number of

280
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:36,200
businesses and took out
numerous steps in our name.

281
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,520
Then on July the fourth,

282
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:37,791
19,

283
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,300
91,

284
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,050
Julia and say,

285
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,831
Reggie rolled daughter,

286
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,470
pearl disappeared off
the face of the earth.

287
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,100
The body is whenever discovered and
Tom's never confessed to murdering them,

288
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,390
but it seems quite likely that they were
the victims if the deadly doctor around

289
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:54,610
this same time on started a brand new
business and this the warner glass bending

290
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:55,120
company,

291
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,340
just the fact that he knew
nothing about glass bending,

292
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,780
he convinced those who would listen,

293
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,300
that he had invented a unique
gloss bending technique to perfect.

294
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,920
He had built a furnace in the basement
of his two story building and made a

295
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:09,340
great show of setting to work
though no one actually saw him.

296
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,233
That one,

297
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,610
the last

298
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,830
after the establishment
of his basement furnace,

299
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:25,550
the disappearance of young women who
came into homes is circle became more and

300
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:26,360
more frequent.

301
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,171
First there was emily,

302
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:27,861
instagrams.

303
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:30,430
You came to Chicago looking
for work in May of 18,

304
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,630
92 homes,

305
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,160
employer as a typewriter girl,

306
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,450
and we're seeing getting
much more for his money.

307
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,580
When the girl disappeared
around Christmas time,

308
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,090
homes dismissed is with what
became a common explanation.

309
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,510
She's gone to Europe to get
married by the end of 18,

310
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:44,901
92.

311
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:46,620
The whole city of Chicago was a buzzword.

312
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,510
The prospect of the approaching
welds fat in celebration of the 400th

313
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,630
anniversary of Columbus is
landing on the America's.

314
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,190
Never want to pass up an opportunity.

315
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,000
Homeless quickly had a third story put
onto his building to serve as a hotel.

316
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,580
However,

317
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,660
he never really intended to
use the floor as a hotel.

318
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,140
The amount of homes could make renting
out rooms were small potatoes compared

319
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:06,500
with water.

320
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,180
You could make a buying,

321
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,940
convincing others that he was opening a
hotel with such a venture in the work so

322
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:13,970
you could raise money from investors
who never see a penny back.

323
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,180
You can also find numerous goods on
credits and sell them without paying for

324
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:17,510
them.

325
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,160
And then as a final windfall,

326
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,580
he decided to make thousands and
insurance money by setting the building on

327
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:23,380
fire,

328
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,990
just like the popular notion that the
hotel was flourishing during the welds

329
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:27,381
fan,

330
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,180
during countless women do that death.

331
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,300
They're all known records that he even
took in a single paying customer when he

332
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,410
set the structure of blaze 18,

333
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,260
93 to claim the insurance,

334
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,260
the only people on the site
where longterm residents,

335
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,690
the resulting claim would spend
years going through the courts,

336
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,060
by which time the claimant's
it'd be behind bars.

337
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,360
With balancing lawsuits,

338
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,070
Holmes decided that it was time to quit.

339
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,820
Chicago has traveled to countries

340
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,310
Lewis and finally to Philadelphia

341
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,360
along the way.

342
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,980
We got married once more this time to a
23 year old with a $2,000 in Harrison's.

343
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,170
He also fell in with a likeminded
swindler by the name of Benjamin Quetzal

344
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:13,180
Pencil.

345
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,170
Old Lady got himself thrown in jail to
passing bad checks and swanee was inside

346
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,630
almost began paying the premiums on the
life insurance policy when he got out

347
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,150
the to joined forces and not
just a vacant lot in Fort Worth.

348
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,361
Yeah,

349
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,930
they set about building a replica of the
complex that Holmes had built and then

350
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,440
burned to the ground in Chicago,

351
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,810
just linked the original building,

352
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:35,500
the Texas hotel featured a number
of strange passengers and twists,

353
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,500
but just what homes planning to
do with a building is unclear.

354
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,510
He never hung around
long enough to use it.

355
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,950
What he did do was take out
tens of thousands of dollars
on mortgages in it and

356
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:49,090
then disappear without making more than
a couple of token payments for to move

357
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,850
to send the new as well on sport
drugstore for the down payments of $50 and

358
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,190
promissory notes that
are completely worthless.

359
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,150
What a surprise.

360
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,850
Had Ben approached a
drugstore supply runs,

361
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:02,360
convinced him that he was interested
in buying the drugstore from homes.

362
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,320
If that ends in the money,

363
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,360
he would then use them
as their main supplier.

364
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,620
They agreed these winds,

365
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,710
although it came unstuck
when the drugstores or app
called in the next day only

366
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,401
to find the place,

367
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,210
shut it up.

368
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,500
It got suspicious and causing
the authorities almost
was arrested and he spent

369
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,334
three days.

370
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,353
Jay

371
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,581
on his release,

372
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,790
homesteaded for Philadelphia and that
least Wyndell that would prove his

373
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,624
undoing.

374
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah,

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,310
he plans to make good on
those insurance premiums.

376
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,340
Had paid for pf still a few months back.

377
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,000
The team then had long been scheming to
defraud the fidelity mutual insurance

378
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,680
company by faking capsules,

379
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:43,260
deaf and splitting the
proceeds in early September.

380
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:43,710
However,

381
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,310
cancel golf,

382
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,900
cold feet and wanted to back out,

383
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,860
and I'm happy homes agreed to meet up the
next day to further discuss the issue.

384
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,900
When he turns up at Pitt source address,

385
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:52,171
homeless,

386
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:53,820
proceeded to get him drunk.

387
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,100
Then he knocked him out with
chloroform handkerchief,

388
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,910
increasing his dosage into
this old friend was debt homes,

389
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:02,670
then attempted to stage the scene
to make it look like an accident.

390
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,890
Then we're this 23 year old wife into.

391
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,810
He jumped on the train for Indianapolis,

392
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:10,440
intends on securing the
$10,000 insurance payout.

393
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,030
In the end,

394
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,930
the payoff was made to be at sols widow,

395
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,880
but homeless convinced her that her
husband had died in $7,500 for the taxes

396
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:18,570
building.

397
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,660
She handed the money over as
an active seeming graciousness.

398
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,240
Homes agreed to accompany in bps,

399
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:27,180
all children to Indianapolis where they
were to stay with that arms before he

400
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:27,751
could deliver them.

401
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:28,201
However,

402
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,150
and he discovered that
he was a wanted man.

403
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,070
Authorities from a number of states,

404
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,240
including Philadelphia

405
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,820
to him.

406
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Okay.

407
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,060
Now officially on the run,

408
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,100
he moved the children
all over the countryside.

409
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,950
At some point you decided that
the children would have to die.

410
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,640
The youngest eight year old Howard was
poisoned with cyanide while the two

411
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,121
girls,

412
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:55,470
but like he gassed to death.

413
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,510
The bodies were buried in a cellar by now.

414
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,280
Detectives were hot on homelessness trail.

415
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,670
They finally caught up with him in
Boston and of all things arrested him for

416
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:03,480
horse staff's,

417
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,300
a raft of the charges
followed and in October of 18,

418
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:07,080
95,

419
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,810
it was convicted of murdering
Benjamin Quetzal Home,

420
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:13,650
subsequently confessed to 27 murders
and was hanged on May the seventh,

421
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:13,950
18,

422
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,783
96.

423
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,480
His dying wish was for his body to be
buried under 10 feet of concrete to

424
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,570
prevent grave robbers from
stealing and dissecting his body.

425
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,390
A luxury which he denied
many of his victims,

426
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,920
so I won't ask whether
