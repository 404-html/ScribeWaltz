1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,500
He is revered as one of the
greatest artists of all time.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,580
For centuries is typifying into
the perfect artistic genius.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,510
His greatest legacy is the surviving
works that we can see today.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,770
The Sistine Chapel,

5
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,820
the statue of David,

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,020
yet behind the artworks law
is a complex and stubborn man,

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,580
and in this week's biographics,

8
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:24,310
we go beyond the facade to
discover the real Michael Angelo,

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,680
Italy in the 15th century.

10
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,380
It was very different to the
country that we know today.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:44,951
Back then,

12
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,350
it was a collection of small republics.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,400
These city states were all
under the governorship of
the pope who was located in

14
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:51,880
Rome.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,350
The key republics were Florence,

16
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:53,801
Genoa,

17
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,700
and Venice.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,770
Every state I didn't.

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,520
Certain governors,

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,280
it's nobles,

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,731
peasants,

22
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,480
priests,

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:58,721
imams,

24
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:02,290
government officials nestled in the
remote app and nine mountains of central

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,230
Italy was the small village of Capri seat.

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,950
It was here on March the sixth,

27
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:06,431
14,

28
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:06,971
75.

29
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:08,100
The Franciscan Deniro,

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,810
Buena Rossi gave birth to her second son,

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,890
Michelangelo,

32
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,320
her husband's a lot of etsy.

33
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:13,660
Does.

34
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,130
Leonardo,

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,921
we are not used to.

36
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,940
Mooney was a lonely official who had
the job of convicting and sentencing

37
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,610
criminals when baby Michael
Angelo was six months old,

38
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:24,280
the family of four moved to Florence here,

39
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,820
a lot of Itso,

40
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,730
so bought a small farm
near the village of set.

41
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,563
In your note,

42
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,330
it was in this village and the child
spent his early years under the care of

43
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,500
wetness farming off newborns do a wetness
for the first few years of life was a

44
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,940
common practice at that time.

45
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,020
The women who took in Michelangelo was
married to a stone cutter in later years

46
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:42,820
when he had transformed
himself into a sculptor.

47
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:47,350
Michelangelo commented that he had drunk
model dust with his nurses milk when he

48
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:47,890
was three.

49
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,890
Michelangelo returned to live
with this family in Florence.

50
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,220
The family was poor rams with
new babies arriving frequently.

51
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,810
The household was overcrowded.

52
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,600
A lot of ECO received a
migo government salary,

53
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,790
and his farm wasn't very successful.

54
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,390
In fact,

55
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,530
he believed that the work of a lowly
farmer was beneath him when he was six

56
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:06,071
years of age,

57
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:08,830
young Michelangelo's tough
life got even tougher.

58
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,620
His mother died leaving
behind five young sons,

59
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,670
including a newborn.

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,660
Ludovico,

61
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,380
did his best working two jobs and still
managing to trundle the boys off to mass

62
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,990
at the Church of Santa Croce
and Florence every Sunday.

63
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,690
This church was filled with
magnificent works of art,

64
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:25,480
including a crucifix carved
by the famous sculptor,

65
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,020
Donatello and wall paintings by he auto,

66
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,220
one of the greatest artists of all time.

67
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,330
The young Michelangelo must have
marveled at these magnificent pieces.

68
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,650
In 1485,

69
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,600
a lot of ego took a new wife,

70
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,670
lucrezia deadly eldine.

71
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Gagliano came from a rich family bringing
600 floor into the union as a dowery.

72
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,730
This was an enormous amount at the time
and it flips to the fortunes of the

73
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:52,570
family overnight and immediate result of
the family's newfound wealth was that a

74
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:56,800
lot of ego was able to afford to send as
Michelangelo to a Latin school to learn

75
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,310
reading,

76
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,761
writing,

77
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,780
and mathematics,

78
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,370
but boy soon proved that he was no
academic boards with his lessons.

79
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,460
He would stare out of the
window while doodling on paper.

80
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,941
However,

81
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,340
one thing he did fall
in love with was poetry,

82
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,290
returning home for vacation,

83
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:21,750
Michelangelo,

84
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,210
he told his father that he
was more interested in art
than in academic studies,

85
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,700
but a lot of ego was not
impressed at that time.

86
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:32,780
Artists were the lowly paid servants of
noblemen being considered less or more

87
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,590
than a servant's Ludovico
wanted his son to aspire to.

88
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,433
More than that,

89
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,040
the only person who seemed to understand
Michelangelo's passion for us was an

90
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,360
older boy that he had befriended by the
name of Francisco Gren Artsy Francisco

91
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:47,420
himself was a budding artist
apprentice do the famous artists,

92
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:47,940
Dominica,

93
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,141
girl,

94
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:48,974
and diary.

95
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,550
He took them Michelangelo to his
Master's workshop and showed him works in

96
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:53,180
progress.

97
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,820
The younger boy was
mesmerized by what he saw.

98
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,610
He knew that being an
artist was his destiny.

99
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,260
Despite his father's negativity,

100
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:03,950
Michelangelo kept begging to be
allowed to pursue his passion.

101
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,670
Meanwhile,

102
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,090
his friend Francisco encouraged
him to produce some drawings,

103
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,580
which he showed to his
master Galleon dire.

104
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,540
The great artist was impressed and
expressed the desire to also take

105
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,390
Michelangelo on.

106
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,250
There's an apprentice.

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,671
Finally,

108
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,440
lots of ECO relented under the age of 12.

109
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:22,700
His son became apprentice to gallon
diode the most around the most successful

110
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,850
artists workshop in Florence
along with his two brothers.

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,430
They were kept busy decorating
chapters in Florence.

112
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,570
The brothers had a number of apprentices
aged between eight and 15 who lived

113
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,060
with them and assisted
with paintings and murals.

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,661
The parents,

115
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,530
including Ludovico,

116
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,850
had to pay for living expenses and for
training from the Ugandans your brothers

117
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:44,620
young Michael Angelo learns how to prepare
a wooden panel for painting and how

118
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,600
to plaster a wall in preparation
for the painting of a fresco.

119
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,620
He was also taught how to make
working drawings called cartoons,

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,470
which would form the basis
of finished paintings

121
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,590
among the apprentices.

122
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,080
Michelangelo was an immediate standout.

123
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,590
Still.

124
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,020
He proved to be stubborn and
it's quite full of himself.

125
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,400
He was given the task of copying works
previously drawn by his master and having

126
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:19,540
done so declared that his works were
better than the originals gallons.

127
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,460
I acknowledged that the
boy had great talent,

128
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,650
but he was angered by
his pride for attitude.

129
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,610
They also saw that Michelangelo lacked
the patients needed to learn some of the

130
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,130
skills required such as painting frescoes.

131
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,740
He showed little interest in
grinding and mixing paints,

132
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,220
and couldn't be bothered mixing the
ingredients needed for the smooth plaster

133
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,740
needed for fresco painting when he was 14,

134
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Michelangelo went one step too far.

135
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,270
He had copied some drawings that
his master had done of women,

136
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,100
but then he did to correct some finer
aspects of the originals by going over

137
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:49,780
them with a broad NIB pen.

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,730
This was too much gallons.

139
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,390
Io kicked Michelangelo out of the workshop
claiming that there was no teaching

140
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,320
this no at all.

141
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,740
Rather than being discouraged,

142
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,920
the talented team made the decision
that paints and pasta went off for him.

143
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,220
He considered them to be a
lesser form of art to him.

144
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,300
The real skill lay in stone producing
fine sculptures of the human form.

145
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,410
This desire would take them to the
very pinnacle of Florentine Ability.

146
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,880
The house of Medici

147
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,460
before Michelangelo had been
dismissed by Gulen diode,

148
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:30,460
some members of the Medici
family visited the workshop.

149
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,140
Among them was an elderly
sculptor named Beto.

150
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,120
Did Giovanni.

151
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:34,870
This man,

152
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,550
notice the talents that
Michelangelo possessed and
struck up a relationship with

153
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,220
a boy.

154
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,240
Often his dismissal.

155
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:43,030
The budding young sculpture
sought out the old man,

156
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,150
but older was employed
by Lorenzo de Medici,

157
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,890
the most powerful man in the city.

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,140
He was making statues,

159
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,400
medals for the man and looking
after his art collection.

160
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,150
Many of Lorenzo statues were
displayed in a golden artists.

161
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:56,470
Went to drawer and carve.

162
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,020
This area was a gathering
place for students,

163
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:02,740
sculptors who would get feedback and
instruction from a whole day about their

164
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:03,310
work.

165
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,700
Soon,

166
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,610
Michelangelo was a regular in the garden.

167
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,600
The now 15 year old began
creating sculptures from
clay and bringing them to the

168
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,260
garden.

169
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,520
They was younger than the other.

170
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,420
Budding is.

171
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,190
His skill was clearly beyond this.

172
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,120
This lead to jealousy sometimes and
even lead to physical violence in one

173
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:19,670
encounter.

174
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,500
Michelangelo,

175
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,430
even at his nose broken that the boy
he was not deterred begging a piece of

176
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:25,750
marble from another sculptor.

177
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,430
He created his first relief carving the
head of a foreign just as he had been

178
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:30,731
hoping.

179
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:34,690
This sculpture was seen by Lorenzo de
Medici who was immediately taken with the

180
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:35,440
boys skill.

181
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,420
He brought Michelangelo into his fold,

182
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,970
giving him his own room and
paying him an allowance.

183
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,030
The young artist's life
was now more peaceful.

184
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,390
He was able to settle down to the task
of perfecting his chosen art form.

185
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,530
One of his first major projects was to
convert a scene from mythology on model

186
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,640
as a relief panel.

187
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,410
This was the battle of the centaurs.

188
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,610
These creatures with the heads and arms
of men and the bodies of horses gave him

189
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,070
plenty of scope to show action and form.

190
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,870
The realism and gentle precision of this
work is remarkable for a sculptor of

191
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:05,890
such a young age.

192
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,880
The other major piece that Michelangelo
produced while working in the house of

193
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,630
Medici was a relief panel
called Madonna of the steps.

194
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,510
It shows the Virgin Mary
nursing the infant Jesus.

195
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,250
The piece is carved on fine white model
and shows the madonnas face in profile

196
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,230
as she holds her infant son against her.

197
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,070
Things were going remarkably well for
the 17 year olds and he was living in the

198
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:31,210
inner sanctum of the richest family in
the city and he had a powerful patron who

199
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,200
admired his talents.

200
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,280
Unfortunately,

201
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,420
it wasn't the last.

202
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,321
In April 14,

203
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:35,741
92,

204
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,180
Lorenzo suddenly died.

205
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,800
His son pro took over,

206
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,630
but he can't let off a sculpture.

207
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,290
He gave Michelangelo no work until the
winter when you decided that he would

208
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,580
like a snowman made.

209
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,470
He ordered Michelangelo to make one.

210
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,500
It would prove to be the
artists strangest condition.

211
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,230
Around the same time the prior of Santo
Spirito asked the young sculptor to a

212
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:59,430
crucifix for his church to license with
the results of the prior gave Michael

213
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,650
Angelo the use of a room
in which he could work.

214
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,940
He was able to dissect corpses
in order to study anatomy.

215
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,990
The idea behind this was,

216
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,351
of course,

217
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:10,470
to make the most lifelike sculptures
of the human body possible.

218
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,740
He believed that in order to know
how to make these sculptures,

219
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,380
he had to know how the
human body was put together.

220
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,661
The US.

221
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:17,910
He actually became one of the first.

222
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,590
People do dissect and study.

223
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,850
The human body in this way,

224
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,690
by 1494,

225
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:36,320
Florence was facing a crisis and army
lads buying King Charles the eighth of

226
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,470
France was it the walls and was
threatening to overrun the city.

227
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,281
Many people,

228
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,560
including Michelangelo,

229
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,433
fled the city.

230
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,730
He traveled to the Lanya in northern
Italy and Venice and important trading

231
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,564
city.

232
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,430
Michelangelo.

233
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,550
He hoped to find work.

234
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,120
However,

235
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,530
he could not find any employment,

236
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,810
so he went back to behlen.

237
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,180
Yeah,

238
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,320
nothing lost his patron.

239
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,930
Michelangelo set out in
search of a replacement.

240
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,730
He found it in the form of San Francisco,

241
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,090
outer vandy or your local
Nobel and politician.

242
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,210
I'll prevent the set,

243
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:06,020
his talented new sculpture to the task
of carving the missing fingers of the

244
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:06,501
unfinished,

245
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:09,800
trying of send them Monica in the
church at the same name again.

246
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,460
Michael Angelo,

247
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,590
now 20 had fallen on his feet.

248
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,060
He enjoyed a comfortable home,

249
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:17,560
had stone and supplies provided and
received commissions for his artwork.

250
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,220
Just as it happens in Florence.

251
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,320
This bred resentment
among other sculptors.

252
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,101
They paid rent,

253
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:25,370
sports tools since stone and
survived out of their own pockets.

254
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,291
Meanwhile,

255
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,124
back in Florence,

256
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,500
a change of power had a cut.

257
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,680
A priest by the name of
[inaudible] Savonarola had
instigated a fierce campaign

258
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:43,850
against the house of Medici.

259
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,100
When the threats of French
invasion hurt emerged,

260
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,660
the house of Medici had fled.

261
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:50,720
The city leaving Savonarola
for you to take power.

262
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,170
This strict churchmen disapproved of
paintings and sculptures that showed the

263
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,100
naked human body.

264
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,920
As a result,

265
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,470
prospects were not good
for local sculptors.

266
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:58,971
However,

267
00:10:58,971 --> 00:10:59,960
in 1495,

268
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,300
Michelangelo felt a
great urge to our town,

269
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:03,590
to Florence to see his family.

270
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,490
While then he made contact with some
members of the house of see now living

271
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,450
under false names,

272
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,000
one of them Lorenzo DPF,

273
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,210
Francisco de Medici wanted Michael Angelo
to help him sell a statute that he had

274
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,044
made earlier.

275
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,540
It was a figure of the
Roman God of Love Cupid.

276
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,360
If the statue was aged to
look like an ancient statue,

277
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:21,260
Lorenzo reasons,

278
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,360
it would make a lot of money in Rome.

279
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,900
Michelangelo is smeared the statue with
deaths to make it look as if it had been

280
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:27,500
buried.

281
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,630
Even took the forge dan deep to Rome,

282
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,380
where it was purchased by a senior
judgment calls and our re Reo.

283
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,411
While in room Michael,

284
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,740
Angela was introduced
to some powerful people,

285
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,060
including members of the board,

286
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,100
your family who numbered
among them the pope,

287
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,280
and he was well aware that Michelangelo
was really the creator of cupids quickly

288
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,200
commissioned him to create
another statue for his collection.

289
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,130
The statue that resulted has come
to be recognized as Michelangelo's

290
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,320
masterpiece,

291
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,820
the statue of Bacchus,

292
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,790
the Greek god of wine and celebrations.

293
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,450
Yes.

294
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,250
Although everyone else was impressed,

295
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,540
the cardinal was not.

296
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,720
He thought of the Gods looked too
drunk and refuse to pay for the work.

297
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,500
Michael Angelo now had to fight to
get paid for a job that he had already

298
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,250
completed.

299
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,970
On top of this,

300
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,240
he received news that his father had
fallen into bad financial straits.

301
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,680
What do you need it and fast.

302
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,050
It was a new patron to
support not just himself,

303
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,190
but also his family.

304
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,350
For several months,

305
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,320
nothing seemed to pan out for
the 21 year old master sculptor.

306
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,560
He was without a patron.

307
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,230
He was without payments for his back,

308
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:35,980
his statue,

309
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,950
and just follow the was in desperate
need of financial assistance.

310
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,390
Then in November of 14,

311
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,310
97 things to contend for the best at,

312
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,150
it was conditioned to produce an exciting
new work by a French ambassador by the

313
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,420
name of Cardinal Zone.

314
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:52,090
Bill had to like grow that and envisioned
a statue of the Virgin Mary cradling

315
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,850
the dead Jesus subject known as the piano.

316
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,860
It took Michael Angelo two
years to complete the theater,

317
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,840
but it was worth it.

318
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,410
The finished work was displayed in the
Vatican and everyone who saw it was

319
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:06,520
amazed at the realism of the flesh and
fabric that the sculptor had fashioned

320
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,660
from the cold model.

321
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,410
The psm made Michelangelo's famous now
the most powerful men in Europe who were

322
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:13,000
clamoring to have him work for them.

323
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,100
It seemed as if as money,

324
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,340
whereas we're finally behind him

325
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,511
back in Florence,

326
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:28,900
the scene have changed
once again on a railroad.

327
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,820
The priesthood fallen into
disfavor and it's been executed.

328
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:32,060
It.

329
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,810
It was now safe for artists to return
and to pursue projects that the

330
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:37,580
authorities of the Florentine Cathedral,

331
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,020
the guns of,

332
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,440
formulates the idea to commission a
giant statue of the biblical killer of

333
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:43,220
Goliath,

334
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,490
young David to sculptors had already
been commissioned to do the job.

335
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,390
Both had failed,

336
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,230
merely managing to make the huge
block of marble almost unusable in 50.

337
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,591
No one.

338
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:54,140
The job was given to Michelangelo
in order to do the job,

339
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,840
these sculptor had to stop
working on another job in Romans,

340
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:57,920
relocate to Florence.

341
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,970
This blessing from one project to another
became a common practice and one that

342
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,310
created frequence legal ramifications.

343
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,270
The creation of Davis was an immensely
challenging and lengthily Joel.

344
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,050
The first decision was to choose the pose
that fitted in with the way the marble

345
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,100
had already been worked.

346
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,160
This prevented him from
emulating the traditional pose,

347
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,070
which showed David standing
with Goliath had his feet,

348
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,820
so therefore he decided to do depict
David's in the moments before the fight,

349
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,950
as if it was looking upon his phone.

350
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,760
His next move was to surround the
huge piece of marble with barricades.

351
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,050
Then you went to work.

352
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,030
He tirelessly chipped away at the giant.

353
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,930
Three years later,

354
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,940
the statue of David was completed.

355
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,920
It was a triumph with crowds lavishing
praise on the creator of the 14 foot nude

356
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,580
figure.

357
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,200
The man who had commissions,

358
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,730
the work pro to arena and ruler of
Florence was also impressed that he told

359
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:49,760
Michael Angelo the David's nodes
was do brought the sculptors.

360
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:53,240
Stubborn pride now came to the but
it was tempered with common sense,

361
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
taking a handful of marble dust.

362
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,920
He climbed up the scaffolding
and pretended to chisel the nose,

363
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,990
even let the dust falls to the ground.

364
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,080
Soderini declared that the
nose was now much better

365
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:13,961
in 50,

366
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:14,490
93,

367
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,600
a new Pope Julius.

368
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:17,040
The second was elected in Rome.

369
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,630
Julius had great artistic ambitions and
he knew who he wanted to spearhead the

370
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,190
many projects he had in mind,

371
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,780
and this of course was
Italy's greatest sculptors.

372
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,850
Michelangelo,

373
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,140
Michelangelo had the skills needed
to do justice to the greats.

374
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,800
Theocratic works that the pope and
visions Julius knocked down the unstable

375
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,640
fifth century basilica of
Saint Peter's and the Vatican,

376
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,590
and it's began rebuilding the
chapter on a much grander scale.

377
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,960
The centerpiece was to be his own tomb,

378
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,540
which would be designed
and carved by Michelangelo.

379
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,590
This massive project was intended to
show the greatness of Julia says both the

380
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,840
Pope and also as a patron of the arts.

381
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,800
It was to be three stories high and
covered in life size sculptures.

382
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,980
The sculptures spent the first eight
months just querying the marble needed for

383
00:15:58,981 --> 00:15:59,814
the projects.

384
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,400
It would prove to be his
most frustrating project,

385
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,850
one on which he would work on
and off for the next 40 years.

386
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,400
In the end of the finished
tomb was smaller than plans,

387
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,900
but still vast.

388
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,300
Only three of the statues
were by Michelangelo,

389
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,350
the large bearded Moses and the
biblical characters of Rachel and Leah,

390
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,960
and instead of being
placed in some pizzas,

391
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,850
it was put in the much less grands.

392
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,220
Church of San Pietro.

393
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,260
Four years into the tomb projects,

394
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,380
Pope Julia set his sights on the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican.

395
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,050
The ceiling was painted with
a pattern of gold stars,

396
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,440
but the pope envisions
something far grander.

397
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,930
Even though Michelangelo was
known as a sculptor and painter,

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,940
the pope chose him to do the work.

399
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,630
The great sculptor had not worked on a
fresco since his days as an apprentice

400
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:45,900
back in Florence bars back in the day
when the pope chose you for a job,

401
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,620
you did it,

402
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,350
but that did not mean that
you have to do it willingly.

403
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,061
Michelangelo,

404
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,650
he considered himself to be a
slave to the whims of the pope.

405
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,570
He wrote a balance of
the painting project.

406
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,220
This is not my profession.

407
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,270
I am wasting my time and all
for nothing they got helped me.

408
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,590
It was a massive job.

409
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,210
The chapel ceiling covered a curved
surface of about 5,600 square feet.

410
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,340
That's 507 square meters.

411
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:08,971
In addition,

412
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:13,170
these ceiling has an uneven surface and
it was 60 feet above the chapels floor.

413
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,130
The pope commissioned the artist to fill
this canvas with scenes from the Old

414
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:17,940
Testament's.

415
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,530
Michelangelo plans out name,

416
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,360
scenes taken from the book of Genesis.

417
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,890
The centerpiece would be the creation
of Adam for for pain staking years.

418
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,480
Michelangelo worked on the ceiling.

419
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,100
It was backbreaking work.

420
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,380
The figures were designed
to be seen from the floor,

421
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,980
but the artists had to paint high up
on the scaffolding lying on its back.

422
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,320
According to his official
biographer on dv,

423
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,580
he works on his own,

424
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,690
applying the plaster,

425
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,650
mixing the colors,

426
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,060
and doing all the painting,

427
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,110
the results.

428
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,040
They were breathtaking.

429
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,940
The use of perspective and the dramatic
rendition of the figures were admired by

430
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,930
everyone who saw them.

431
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,470
Having triumphantly completed
the assisting chapel project.

432
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,090
Michelangelo returns to his work on the
tube of Julius when Pope Julius died in

433
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:57,481
15.

434
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:58,170
13.

435
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,720
The urgency I went out
to the projects in 15,

436
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,141
17,

437
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:01,651
the new pope,

438
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:05,820
Leo the 10th asked Michelangelo to
design a new facade for the Church of San

439
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,930
Lorenzo in Florence.

440
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,280
There we had no experience.

441
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,150
That's an architect's.

442
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,790
The sculptor was confident
that he could do a good job.

443
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,250
He throw himself into the projects,

444
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,770
buying a piece of land near the
church in order to work on his facade,

445
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,090
but then in 15,

446
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,600
20,

447
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,420
the project was put on hold
and then cancel altogether.

448
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,380
Michelangelo,

449
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,340
he was furious.

450
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,990
He had invested himself fully,

451
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,510
both physically and
financially into the project.

452
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,040
Partly to placate him,

453
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,330
the pope gave him a replacement projects
the MEDICI tombs to be created in

454
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,510
remembrance of two members of the
family who had died prematurely.

455
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,500
Michelangelo began work on the
Medici Chapel and 50 19 two,

456
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,480
which was added to the
library a few years later.

457
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,500
Both buildings took years to
complete and are stunning designs.

458
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,550
The artist was now at the
height of his creative power,

459
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,640
but crisis was just around the corner.

460
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,241
In 15,

461
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,020
27 armies from France and the
holy Roman Empire invaded Italy.

462
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,390
Rome was looted and burned by now.

463
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:09,470
There was yet another pope,

464
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,400
claimants the seventh,

465
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,470
and he sided with the holy Roman Empire.

466
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:13,750
When it besieged Florence,

467
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,663
a loyal Florence,

468
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,210
Michelangelo returns
home to defend this city.

469
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,390
He set to work designing new
fortifications to help protect the city.

470
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,400
That's his efforts were in vain.

471
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,600
After a long struggle,

472
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,030
the city fell with many
people being killed.

473
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,780
Michelangelo,

474
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,680
he went into hiding,

475
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,430
concealing himself in a
tiny crypt onto the ultra.

476
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,880
If the Medici Chapel in Santa Renzo very
states until the news came through that

477
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,800
the pope had no animosity against him.

478
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,120
Michelangelo spends his latter years
writing poetry and continuing to work for

479
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:51,960
the pope's in Rome.

480
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,920
One of his most famous poems describes
how uncomfortable he was when painting

481
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,270
the Sistine Chapel ceiling bends almost
double with paint splashing on his face

482
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,050
as he aged.

483
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,580
He wrote more poems of a religious nature
throughout the reign of several pipes.

484
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,340
He held the position of chief
architects of some peters.

485
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,000
Meanwhile,

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,960
he works on carvings that were variations
of the work that had fast propels him

487
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,500
to fame,

488
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,310
the PSL.

489
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,070
It was while working on one of his
pieces on February the twelfth,

490
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:17,431
15,

491
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:20,460
64 that he began to feel
feverish you took to his bat,

492
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,200
and despite the efforts of his doctors,

493
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,730
he died six days later.

494
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,430
His dying wish was to have
his body returned to Florence,

495
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,960
the city that he loved.

496
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,840
