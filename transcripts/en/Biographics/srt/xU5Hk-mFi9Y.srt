1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,100
What August the fourth 1892 Andrew and
Abby Borden were brutally matters in

2
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:07,840
their home in fall river,
Massachusetts.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,900
Their heads had been split open in a fit
of rage from nearly a dozen blows from

4
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:16,330
a hatchet. There was no theft.
There was no sign of a break.

5
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:20,170
In the 32 year old daughter Lizzie Borden
was at home when their parents were

6
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:20,800
killed.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,090
She inherited her father's multimillion
dollar fortune and everyone in fall

8
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,260
river believed that she had killed her
parents in cold blood. But in the end,

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,710
that simply was not enough evidence to
convict her and she was allowed to go

10
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:37,630
free. Nearly 120 years later, the
case is still an unsolved mystery.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,520
So did Lizzie Borden really kill her
parents or is the identity of the real

12
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,110
killer still unknown?

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,303
Yeah.

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,710
Andrew Borden came from a long line
of wealthy and successful people,

15
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:03,130
but his own parents struggled
with poverty. As a young man,

16
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:07,060
he started working as an underwriter
at a bank in fall river, Massachusetts.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,960
He used his paychecks to
purchase investment real
estate and ran furniture and

18
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:15,220
textile businesses. He was eventually
promoted as the manager of the bank,

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,590
even though he was making a lot of money.

20
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:22,130
He only paid for the band necessities
for himself and for his family is

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,720
fortunate.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,580
It grew to over $300,000 which in
modern day dollars is about 8 million.

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,930
He married a woman named Sarah Anthony
Moss and they had three children together.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,220
Emma was the oldest. They had a second
daughter named Dallas who don't as a baby.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,050
Lizzie Borden was the youngest daughter
born in 1860 when she was only two years

26
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:45,070
old and this, these mother Sarah became
gravely ill and I was 12 at the time,

27
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,730
so she was old enough to remember the
death of her sister and fully understood

28
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:53,290
the gravity of losing their mother on
her deathbed am I swore to take care of

29
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:57,520
baby Lizzie like a mother, and she
took that promise incredibly seriously.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,960
Three Years After Sarah Staff Andrew Board
and married a woman named Abby Duffy,

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,730
who was 15 at the time,

32
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:07,630
refused to address Abby as mother and
it's called her by her first name,

33
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:11,110
her entire childhood. There's, he grew
up to be very close with her sister Emma,

34
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:14,620
who truly did feel more like a mother
to have in a big sister. However,

35
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:18,760
this backfired because teenage Emma was
constantly reminding her younger sister

36
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:21,400
that their birth mother was debt.
Because of this,

37
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,340
Lizzy never formed a close
relationship with her stepmother.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,860
She leads to describe that
relationship is cordial,

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,730
but she grew up feeling as though she
never really knew a mother's love.

40
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,150
We don't know much about the intimate
details of there's these relationship with

41
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,230
our father accepts that he was a very
busy man as he had a full time job and

42
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:42,190
also ran his own businesses on the side.
There's, he claims to love him very much,

43
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:45,940
but it's true business tactics and lack
of empathy for customers defaulting on

44
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,990
some of their loans because some people
in town to dislike him as well as his

45
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:54,280
family. Lizzie Borden's elementary school
teachers described her as being aloof,

46
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,730
so she was either painfully shy or
felt as though she didn't want to make

47
00:02:57,731 --> 00:03:01,090
friends. She was also for
having dramatic mood swings.

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
She could either be very
relaxed and unemotional or
she could burst out in a fit

49
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,210
of rage.

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,270
This is not uncommon for children who
have lost their parents at a young age,

51
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:14,320
but she was severely neglected considering
for tragedy that had before than

52
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,154
their family.

53
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,550
The wealthy members of the extended board
and family lived in mansions up in a

54
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:28,430
fashionable neighborhood called hell.
They enjoy,

55
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:33,230
it's an easy life with teams of seven so
that they can call Andrew Borden on the

56
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:33,741
other hands,

57
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:37,940
rented half of a duplex for his family
and waited until this children were grown

58
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:41,540
to buy that house and combine
both harvest and do a single home.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,680
He never installed electricity or indoor
plumbing even though it was actually

60
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,510
quite affordable at that time.

61
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,200
As she grew older and as he began to
learn more about her extended family who

62
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,220
lived up on the hill,

63
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,300
her cousins were always attending
parties and dances and went to the local

64
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,970
theater together with young
people their own age does.

65
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,890
He wanted to join the rest of our friends,

66
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:05,180
but Andrew Board and thought that these
activities were simply a waste of money.

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,980
He never gave his daughters and allowance
to attend any of these social outings

68
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,210
living in a working class neighborhood
unless he seemed far too rich to fit in

69
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:14,811
where they lived,

70
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:18,200
and yet their father never gave them
money to socialize up on the hill.

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,880
They were stuck in an isolating situation
and they felt like outcasts or cousins

72
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:26,180
or married rich man and their fathers
paid dowries to help them buy their own

73
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,350
houses.
Meanwhile,

74
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,370
Lizzy and Emma were still living with
their parents as their only social

75
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,860
interactions came from
church related events.

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,600
Lizzie Borden really only had one close
friends and that was her neighbor,

77
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,643
Alice Russell.

78
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,760
Many people who knew Lizzie Borden before
the murders said that she was a gentle

79
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,590
person with a kind heart.

80
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,190
She was leave slices of chocolate cake
for men who came to her father's house

81
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:53,150
for maintenance and insisted on tipping
the groundskeeper whenever her father

82
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,650
was too cheap to do it himself.

83
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,970
She also gave candy to local children
along with cards that were signed from

84
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,800
Auntie Borden, even though women were
not allowed to hold a job at the time.

85
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,360
Lizzie kept herself busy.

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,320
She taught Sunday school to the
local children in fall river,

87
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:13,250
and most people in town knew of her as
being a very pious and a religious woman.

88
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,000
She was also heavily involved
in local women's charity groups.

89
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,660
Washing testified that she
loved her father very much less.

90
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,060
He fundamentally disagreed in
the way he handled his money.

91
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,270
She also believed that her step mother
was trying to take advantage of his

92
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,130
fortune when she was 27 years old.

93
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,760
Lizzie's father gave a house to
his wife's half sister for free.

94
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,740
This made busy Emma furious because they
were his own daughters and yet he had

95
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,120
never given them such an extravagant gift.
When he realized how unfair this was,

96
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:45,110
he gave his daughters the deed to the
house he grew up into try and pacify them.

97
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:45,591
However,

98
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:49,670
there was a strict code of etiquette that
unmarried women could not live alone.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,630
Since Lizzie and Emma never found husbands
owning the deed to that grandfather's

100
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:57,740
home was virtually useless and they
were never allowed to move out of their

101
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,580
father's house.

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,990
They eventually sold the house back to
their father for $5,000 even after doing

103
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,600
this, it was still not enough
to make up for the jealousy.

104
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,810
I'm the resentments that there's,
he felt towards her step mother Abbey.

105
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,130
Lizzie Borden was unhappy living with
her father and her stepmother and she

106
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:17,450
spent as much time as possible out of
the house soon after the arguments about

107
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,690
the houses Andrey board and agreed
to let he visit Europe. But the trip,

108
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,920
I only made her realize just how much
she had missed in her younger years.

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,810
When she retired in times
of the United States,

110
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:30,440
she often chosen not to eat meals with
our parents and went up to the bedroom

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,260
without even saying hello
live in the boarding house.

112
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,270
It went on like this for several more
years in 1892 does he bought was 32 years

113
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:43,310
old and her sister Emma was 42 neither
of them had gotten married in the 18

114
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:47,900
hundreds this made them spinsters
women who were considered to be 40 well

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,530
defined her husbands. There is no
record of why they never married,

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,620
but their family issues clearly
had something to do with that.

117
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,210
Lizzy continue to devote herself to the
church as well as local animal rescue.

118
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,740
She was raising a family of pigeons on
that property and she loved them like

119
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,120
perhaps in June of that same year entry
purchase the hatchet and started killing

120
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,060
Lizzie's bad so that he
could save money on meat.

121
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,810
Lizzy may have felt that how a
window of opportunity to escape this

122
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,960
dysfunctional family and find a
better life was closing in on her.

123
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,740
Her father was 70 years old and she
needed to face the possibility that he may

124
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,470
die soon if there's money was
controlled by her stepmother.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,760
She knew things would get
much worse at any moment.

126
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,040
Lizzie Borden and to
assist to Emma's lives,

127
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,090
we're going to be over unless
he did something to stop it.

128
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,570
As we mentioned earlier,

129
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:47,310
Andrew and Abby board and were murdered
on August the fourth 1892 the events

130
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,480
leading up to them murders may give a
clue as to what may have really happened

131
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,830
on that fateful day.

132
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,520
On August the second the entire
board and family was feeling sick.

133
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,570
I'll be bored and visited her local
doctor asking if it was possible that have

134
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:01,950
bread had been poisoned.

135
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,940
Her doctor said that it was
far more likely that she
simply ate some rotten meat

136
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,700
and that everyone in the house
was suffering from food poisoning.

137
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,620
This was not uncommon back then since
there were no refrigerators to keep meat

138
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:16,170
and cheese from going
bad in the summer heat.

139
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,810
On August the third the
night before the murders,

140
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:23,220
Lizzie and Emma's uncle John Moss showed
up and announced he did not bring any

141
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:26,340
luggage, but he asked to
stay over night. John Moss,

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,960
he was the brother of Sarah Moss,

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Andrew's first wife and the girls
biological uncle. For whatever reason,

144
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,760
this named Lizzie Borden feel uneasy.
She told her friends, Alice Russell,

145
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,210
but she was terrified that
someone was about to the family.

146
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,680
According to his testimony,
John boss woke up at 6:00 AM the next day.

147
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,480
On August the fourth rigid,

148
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,170
the maid cooked food for her master's
and gassed and serve their breakfast to

149
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,850
Abby,
Andrew and John.

150
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,500
Around 7:00 AM Jon announced that he was
going to see his other relatives town

151
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,920
and his left the house at around
eight 30 in the morning there's,

152
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,610
he said that she was feeling sick so she
never said hello to her uncle law came

153
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,260
down to eat breakfast with our family.

154
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,310
Andrew Borden went to work at the bank
around 9:00 AM according to the maid

155
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,900
rigid Mrs Borden Asta to wash the windows
outside that day and she said that she

156
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,780
would have makes the bet and do
the laundry in the guest bedroom.

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,790
When Bridgette was done
washing the windows,

158
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,530
she was feeling exhausted from
working in the summer. He,

159
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:22,860
since she was still sick to her stomach,

160
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,640
she had been vomiting in the backyard
and desperately needed some rest.

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,260
Andrew was feeling sick at work,

162
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:32,190
so he returns home around 11:00 AM but
all of the doors were locked with a

163
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:35,130
deadbolt, so is key to the
front door. It wouldn't work.

164
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,050
This was strange and he pounded on the
door to have someone let him in rigid

165
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,860
rush in the front door and unlocked it.

166
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,740
Andrew Board and decided to take
a nap on the living room couch,

167
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,560
hoping that he could sleep off his
sickness during his lunch break.

168
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,870
Bridget saw this as an
opportunity to rest,

169
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,080
so she went up to her bedroom in
the ASIC to take an APP as well.

170
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,980
Lizzy claims that she had to go outside
to the bond and look for a fishing lure

171
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,540
for a trip that she was taking.

172
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,260
The following weekend's according to
her testimony during that small 10 to 15

173
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:02,700
minute window of time outside,

174
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,600
someone had taken a hatchet to
our father's face at 11 times.

175
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,040
His eyeballs were cut in half.

176
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,330
His nose was gone and he was barely
recognizable as a person anymore. There's,

177
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:16,200
he walked back into the house and when
she saw a father's mutilated body,

178
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,250
she screamed. She called to Bridget,
does how hard that her father was dead.

179
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,240
She ran next door to a neighbor called
Adelaide Churchill saying, I miss this.

180
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,850
Churchill do come over.
Someone has killed father.

181
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,080
They notified the police and the family
doctor. You arrive to examine the body.

182
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,040
By that time,

183
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,180
everyone in the neighborhood knew about
the crime and re Borden's wounds were

184
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,390
still fresh. It's suggesting that the
attack had happened very recently.

185
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,200
There's his friend Alice Russell rushed
over to the house to see what was wrong.

186
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,530
Lizzie, she was hysterical and
leaned on. Alice for comfort.

187
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,800
Lizzy asked Bridget to check upstairs
for her step mother saying, well,

188
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,660
someone find Mrs Borden.

189
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,830
This is Borden was lying face down on
the floor of one of the guest bedrooms.

190
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,700
She had also been killed by an ax,
but this time in the back of the hat,

191
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,780
Mrs Borden's blood was dry and medical
examiners estimated that she died in

192
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,640
roughly two hours before our husbands.

193
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,630
This would mean that the killer must
have been in the house the entire time

194
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,480
waiting for the perfect
opportunity to kill Andrew Borden.

195
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,290
Lizzy sister Emma was out of town
visiting a friend and they had to send a

196
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,310
telegram telling her to come home. She
had a solid alibi about our whereabouts,

197
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:24,180
so the police removed her as a potential
suspect. Rigid. The maid was home,

198
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:26,880
but she had nothing to gain
by killing her masters.

199
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,240
She was also removed as a
potential suspect by the police.

200
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,201
When the police arrived,

201
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,720
it was noted that no one in
the house was covered in blood.

202
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,970
If Lizzie Borden really
did kill her father,

203
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,910
she would have blood splattered
all over our clothes.

204
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,970
She would not have been able to clean
herself off within a matter of 10 minutes,

205
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:44,520
especially without any
running water in the house.

206
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
It's considering she was one of the only
people home at the time that she had

207
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,890
the most to gain from a parents' deaths.
All eyes were on her,

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,790
stood with their family members and her
father's business associates at their

209
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,690
parent's funeral.

210
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,690
Instead of watching their patterns
cascades get buried in the ground,

211
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,780
so the police, or did the bodies
be taken for a second autopsy?

212
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,830
The police also had free reign to search
the entire house from top to bottom,

213
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:18,460
and yet they couldn't find the murder
weapon or any solid evidence that would

214
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,380
prove the identity of the killer.

215
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,860
Lizzie Borden was questioned by the police
for several hours into answers where

216
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:28,090
sometimes inconsistent as if she
couldn't quite get her story straight.

217
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,660
The beliefs saw this as evidence
that she was lying. However,

218
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,530
her doctor had injected her with morphine
before each interview saying that it

219
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,120
would help calm her nerves.

220
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,870
These injections would have made her
feel mentally cloudy and confused.

221
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,070
In some cases, the drug can even
cause delusions and hallucinations.

222
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,540
Despite having this drug running through
her vein story still never confessed to

223
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,760
killing her parents
leading up to the trial,

224
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,940
I'm a Borden and Alice Russell witnessed
Lizzie Borden burning one of her

225
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,200
dresses in the back yard.

226
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,250
She claims that she was simply disposing
of old clothes that have paint stains

227
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:00,640
on them.

228
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,360
She gave the police the blue dress that
everyone had witnessed her wearing the

229
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,540
day of the murders and it was
completely free of bluffs.

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,020
They also never found a bloody
dress when searching the house,

231
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,680
but the police saw the burning of the
mystery dress as a sign that she may have

232
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:18,400
changed out of the clothes that she
kills her parents and she was trying to

233
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,510
destroy the evidence.

234
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,410
Lizzie Borden was arrested on suspicion
of killing her parents and she was taken

235
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,420
to a holding cell in a women's prison.

236
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,570
The dates of the trial where from June
5th to 20th of 1893 this was nearly a

237
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,210
year after the death of her parents,
a pharmacist named Eli.

238
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:38,380
Ben's testified in court that Lizzie
Borden requested to buy potassium cyanide

239
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,370
the day before the murder,

240
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,970
but he refused to sell it to her because
he suspected that she had terrible

241
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:46,630
intentions when the police exam to the
bodies of mister and missus board and the

242
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:51,190
autopsy report showed that they had
never been poisons. It was just bad food.

243
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:53,230
After all this meant
Mister Benz is claimed,

244
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:56,650
didn't improve that Lizzie did anything
wrong. Her neighbor and friends,

245
00:13:56,651 --> 00:14:00,280
Alice Russell also testified against
her about burning the dress. However,

246
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,500
without having the actual dress on hands,

247
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:06,310
they still could not prove that there
was ever any blood on us after nearly a

248
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,330
year to prepare their case.

249
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,950
The police had nothing but circumstantial
evidence against her and it was simply

250
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,280
not enough to prove that she was guilty.
The members of the jury,

251
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
they were all men which
was customary at the time.

252
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,530
All of them had a very hard time
believing that the same woman who was the

253
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:25,090
Sunday school teacher could really be
the same monster who committed cold

254
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
blooded murder.

255
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,130
They fought him more likely there's a
prowler broke into the home and killed Mr

256
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:30,964
and Mrs Borden.

257
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,560
They only took 19 minutes to make
the decision that she was not guilty

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,090
for a parents' deaths.

259
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,770
Lizzie and ptosis to Emma split their
father's inheritance in half and it was

260
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:50,010
more than enough money to take care
of them for the rest of their lives.

261
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,050
They could finally afford
buy and luxurious house on
the hill called Maplecroft.

262
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,410
They also harder staff have maids
and the driver to take them anywhere.

263
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,080
They wanted to go in a horse drawn coach.
There's,

264
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:04,050
he changed her name to Elizabeth after
moving in in hopes of escaping her

265
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:08,660
reputation in her mind's the life on
the hill may have seems like a million

266
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,290
miles away, but the reality was
that they were still in fall river.

267
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,550
I reputation as a murderer. I continue
to follow her for the rest of our life.

268
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,670
Magazine's reported false rumors that
she was a shoplifter that she killed a

269
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,390
baby kittens and birds
when she was a child.

270
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,020
People did not want to sit in there and
charge and say our house was pummeled

271
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:29,150
with rotten eggs on a regular basis.

272
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,830
No one wanted to be associated with this
woman who may have murdered our parents,

273
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,700
local children.

274
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,300
They made up a rhyme without her murder
and enjoyed singing it outside the

275
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,940
window and it went. As such,
Lizzie Borden took an ax.

276
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,090
She gave her mother 40 wax
when she saw what she had done,

277
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,380
she gave her father 41 now,
despite all of the criticism,

278
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:52,580
Lizzie never moved away to escape the
ridicule and tried to make the best of her

279
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,390
situation.

280
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,260
She began attending plays at the local
theater and three parties in her new home

281
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,900
for the cast and crew. She seemed
to be particularly, in fact,

282
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,570
she waited with an
actress named Nancy Neil.

283
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,720
Neal was known for having a deep
voice and the masculine attitude,

284
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:09,180
which led some people to believe that
the two might have been having an affair.

285
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,170
It turns out that O'neil
was truly a great actress,

286
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,710
worthy of admiration there because she
eventually moved to Hollywood and start

287
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,850
in a few movies.

288
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,720
Even though Lizzie Borden was now wealthy
and living in a good part of town,

289
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,420
she continued to be single
for the rest of her life,

290
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,510
but she may have been
concealing a hit and romance.

291
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,360
The only real evidence of the latter
though was a letter that she wrote to a

292
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:33,860
female friend saying something
rather romantic. I dreamed
of you the other night,

293
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,260
but I Dan, not to put my dreams on
paper for some unknown reason. Them or,

294
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:42,050
and Lizzie got into an argument and Emma
decided it was time for her to move out

295
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:42,800
of fall river.

296
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,720
She moves far away to escape the bad
reputation that the board and then had

297
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,550
brought them.
The sisters never saw each other again.

298
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,450
Some people believe that this is proof
of Lizzy's girls and that she must have

299
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,400
confessed to Emma how are the MLF.

300
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:58,430
Shortly after one of Lizzy's big
parties in which the actress,

301
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,810
Nance O'neil was in attendance,

302
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,520
some people believe that it may be more
likely that she was caught in a lesbian

303
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:08,300
affair or and the simply
disapproved of her new lifestyle.

304
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,110
Lizzie Borden continued to live alone in
her Maplecroft mansion for the rest of

305
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:12,740
her life.

306
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,570
She died at the age of 66 she left a
significant portion of her estate to the

307
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,360
fall river animal rescue
league in her well,

308
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,140
she also left thousands of dollars to
each of our close friends and cousins.

309
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,621
Today.

310
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:28,850
Both our childhood home by the river
runs Maplecroft mansion were purchased by

311
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:32,150
an investor and turned into museums.
To this day,

312
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,390
people still speculate whether Lizzie
Borden truly kills her parents,

313
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,670
but we'll probably never know.

314
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,240
