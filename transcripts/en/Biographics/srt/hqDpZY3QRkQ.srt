1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,340
He was a man who was impossible to ignore
the flamboyant character with a cigar

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:08,930
and a $50,000 pinky ring.
Although he weighed over 250 pounds.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,700
He could when the occasion demands or
did move with a lethal speed and force is

4
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:17,090
generally smile contrasted with the
two scars that streaked across his left

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:19,130
cheek. Then there was his
clothing, his wardrobe.

6
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:23,180
It was nothing short of outrageous
custom tailored purple suits. Pella,

7
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:26,060
gray fedoras and diamond
encrusted stick pens.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,200
He loved attention once he'd be able
to adore him even as he ruthlessly

9
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,330
dispatched those who we have no useful.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,610
His name was Al Capone and he has
become the symbol of American greed and

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:42,611
corruption in the 1920s and thirties when
he's eyes on January the 25th of 1947

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,400
the New York Times called him a monster
symbol of a disease which was eating

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,360
into the consciousness of America about
the paper it went on to say the home was

14
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:53,480
incredible. The creation
of an evil dream. Yes.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,730
Almost everything that the public
thought they knew about him nams,

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,360
the most of us think
we know today is false.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,350
The products of decades of
glorification and mythmaking.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,310
I did today's biographics video.

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,160
We're going to peel back the layers
to discover the real al Capone.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,593
Yeah,

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,230
no.

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,100
Gabrielle and Theresa Component made
the big move from Sicily to New York in

23
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:28,101
1894 they ended up in a four room at
flat on Park Avenue adjacent to the

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,761
Brooklyn Navy Yard with a couple,

25
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,900
had two sons into the youngest
who was just a few months souls.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,720
Third boy followed shortly after
their arrival boulder by trade.

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,480
Gabrielle was looking for
a new life in America.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,710
What he found was a city in which
immigrants were viewed as lower citizens,

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,491
Italians,

30
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:48,570
especially with vilified by Americans
who blamed the spiraling crime rates and

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,080
there's a New York was experiencing
on them. Yeah. The components,

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,820
they were a hard working family.

33
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,350
They were law abiding and trying
to fit in to their new society.

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,820
Okay.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,350
When the fourth son Alfonse was born
in 1899 the family had settled into a

36
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,920
decent market, hard existence, life
around the Brooklyn Naval Yard.

37
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,360
It was pretty rough and tumble,

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,410
and then by the age of 10 young Al Capone
had begun to exhibit to the toughness

39
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,770
and brashness that he carried into
his adult life. From the start,

40
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:22,710
Alan merged as a natural leader at the
age of 14 he forms the Navy street gang

41
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,130
in order to protect Italian women from
harassment from the Irish neighbors by

42
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:31,060
now had been expelled from school for
punching a female teacher in the face.

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,620
But you know what he said? Well, she ended
in first just prior to World War One,

44
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,310
the components,

45
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,790
they moved down to the Italian [inaudible]
Gabrielle's head down and get on with

46
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,900
the data team was paying off and it's
Al found himself in an upwardly mobile

47
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:44,441
middle class.

48
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:47,980
The university still further up the
hill though was where the really wet off

49
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:51,850
people left this area. It was strictly
off limits to the likes of the components.

50
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,420
The teenage owl looks upon
this area and via size.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,430
This was where the Rockefellers nibs
and the feisty teaming saw reason why he

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,850
couldn't live the Rockefeller wait.
He just got to find a means.

53
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,013
Guesstimate.

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,170
By the age of 19 Al had
become a local tough.

55
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,660
He knew how to use a gun and a knife.

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,590
He was a big British draw that you could
knock him out into the grounds with a

57
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:22,740
single punch.
It also finds himself a family.

58
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,800
On December the 30th 1918 he married,
made Kauflin.

59
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,360
It was two years older than him.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,510
Three weeks previously may
have given birth to their son,

61
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,260
Elvis family life and encouraged vein
to get on the straight and narrow,

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,770
intense on turning to a respectable
life worthy of his wife and child.

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,150
He moved the family out of
the neighborhood and away
from the bad influences.

64
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,440
They shifted the Baltimore and Al took
a job as a bookkeeper. Ironically,

65
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,400
this straight job,

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,020
we'd come in handy down the track when
he was juggling millions of dollars and

67
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,170
from bootleg liquor.

68
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,440
Now that could have been the end of the
story for our phones and make your pain.

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,760
They could have settled into an uneventful
life of respectability in Baltimore.

70
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,810
Maybe even work their way up the social
ladder to gain some community status.

71
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,480
But wow.
Allows we well know that wasn't it.

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,433
Yeah.

73
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,840
With a sudden death of his
father of a heart attack,

74
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,730
Al's flirtation with
respectability. Well, it was over.

75
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,640
He returned for the funeral
and soon found that the family,

76
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,690
we're now looking to him for guidance
as well as financial support that would

77
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:28,860
require more money than he was earning
as a bookkeeper in Baltimore. Meanwhile,

78
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,030
the local gang that Al had pulled away
from an outgrowth of the Manhattan based

79
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:36,820
five points, gang, they were at a
crossroads six months earlier and Afi,

80
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,850
a big wig in Chicago named big Jim
Coliseum have been shot dead and leader of

81
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:42,300
the gang.

82
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,830
That component pulled away from Johnny
Toria was intent on stepping into the

83
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,290
vacuum created by big gyms demise.

84
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,950
He invited component to join him
as his right hands, man. Sorry.

85
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,380
You had been grooming component
for the last couple of years.

86
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,180
They'd given him a job as a collector to
ensure extortion payments were made. Oh,

87
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,740
he soon graduated to become
the main bouncer and bartender
at the Harvard Inn on

88
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:05,574
Coney island.

89
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,910
Okay.

90
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,270
Now it was one line to this established
and then the dowels hold Avion or patron

91
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,340
that she had a nice rear ends.
The girl's brother, well,

92
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:20,290
she doesn't take so kindly to the
remark and in an instant had carved up

93
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,560
Capone's face with a bottle open
up for the rest of his life.

94
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,180
Our would carry dual stripes down his
cheek giving rise to the name Scarface.

95
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,423
Yeah.

96
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,120
Now,
while they had been in Baltimore,

97
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,930
rumors had circulated an owl had
been involved in a couple of murders.

98
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:40,720
One prostitute,
he was suspected of withholding pin money,

99
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,750
and the other was a friend who'd
reneged on a gambling debt.

100
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,200
All of this was bringing unwanted
police attention to the gang,

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,240
and shortly after his father's funeral,

102
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,550
deponent was called to a meeting with
lucky Luciano, a key member of the gang.

103
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,650
So what's going on now?
It's it to avast nervously.

104
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,350
I'll tell you what's going on.
Ac on her applied,

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,130
you're going to get the hell out of town.
Don't bother to pack Lucy on Luciana.

106
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:08,780
He then handed out an envelope which
contained $2,000 which is about $25,000 in

107
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:13,070
today's money and directed him to go
straight to grand central station had for

108
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,610
Chicago.

109
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,443
Right.

110
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll arrived in Chicago in 1921 ready,
willing and eager to none the rights.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,430
He left his wife and maybe behind in
Brooklyn with instructions to follow one

112
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:30,730
set established then you life.
The challenge now for Johnny Tario,

113
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:34,870
the leader of the gang was to get an al
Capone to stop using his fists and start

114
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:37,870
using his brains in order
to succeed in the rackets.

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,580
He put Capone in the position of head
bouncer and bartender at the Ford uses a

116
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:45,910
four story building which serves
as Torreos general officers,

117
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,300
which also housed a saloon and a cafe.
The top floor of this establishment,

118
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,860
well that was a brothel and Al apparently
spent quite a lot of time on that

119
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:57,370
floor where he wasn't exactly working.
Indeed,

120
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:01,420
his sexual proclivities resulted
in a lifelong battle with syphilis.

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,150
Okay.

122
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,250
This,
it was no place for the weak of heart.

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Countless unsolved murders took place
there with al playing a leading hand in

124
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:16,230
dispatching those who tario
wanted to eliminate it. In fact,

125
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,670
Adelaide did so well within the year
that he was made a partner sharing in the

126
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,130
$100,000 annual profits.

127
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,750
Now it's Oreo talk about how to portray
an air of respectability even as he

128
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:31,200
delved deeper and deeper into
the underworld. As a cover,

129
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,050
our opens a secondhand
furniture store next door.

130
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,890
He carry business cards announcing
his occupation as furniture dealer.

131
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,270
As Chicago authorities began to crack
down and organized crime Torrio spread his

132
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:45,150
business interests into the
suburbs and the suburbs.

133
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,900
Local police and politicians, well,
they can be controlled more easily.

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,230
In fact,
it was torreos expansion beyond Chicago.

135
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,210
That was the key to the development of
the empire that Capone would eventually

136
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:04,430
inherit. By the time component
arrived in the windy city. Sorry,

137
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:08,800
I had already set up vice gambling and
prostitution operations in the nearby

138
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:12,340
town of Burnham. Then with the
election of crime busting Chicago.

139
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:13,540
Now William need divine.

140
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:18,541
In October of 1923 the entire base of
the operation was moved to the western

141
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,260
suburb of road.

142
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,790
The plan was to make Cicero a
wide open town, whether again,

143
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,410
good pedal booze and accommodate
gamblers at will to do so sorry.

144
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,990
He reached an agreement
with the authorities to shut
down his brothels in Cicero

145
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,000
so long as he had free reign on the
other two arms of his business by cutting

146
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:42,130
the police and politicians
in on the profits.

147
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,510
Johnny soon develops the operation he
wants us within six months of moving in.

148
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,920
The outfit owns the town of
Cicero, lock, stock, and barrel.

149
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,313
Why

150
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
January of 1924 Tory,

151
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:02,760
I felt so confident in his position that
he embarks on a trip back to the old

152
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,590
country when he planned to set his mother
up in a fine home in Venice and this

153
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,910
absence would be in charge.

154
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,830
Alice fest challenges to make sure that
the officials who had his back, well,

155
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,100
that they stayed in office,

156
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,860
the local elections were to be
held in April and component,

157
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:20,700
was prepared to go to any lengths to
keep the incumbents in office. Well,

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,250
what's the way Al Capone?
You would do this? Well,

159
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:27,510
that would be by bringing some extra
muscle. He brought his two older brothers,

160
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,520
Ralph and frank over from New York.

161
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,450
The brothers thought nothing of destroying
balance and replacing them with votes

162
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:34,920
for that own candidates.

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,880
Everyone kind of just went along with
whatever the Capones did. The police,

164
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,620
the sheriff,
even the state's attorney,

165
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,120
they all went along with this apparently
deciding that it was futile to try and

166
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,330
pose them. On the day of the
election and Cicero tario Capone,

167
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:51,630
gangsters used guns and
fists to intimidate voters,

168
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,750
escorting them to the ballot box and
watching them drop their votes for the

169
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:58,410
incumbent mayor directly into the
box on his polar watches and election

170
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:02,310
officials were held captive until after
the ballot closed on honest citizens as

171
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:06,030
well. Obviously they were
outraged at this. Some of
them even cools upon Chicago.

172
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:11,010
Judge Edmond DG Iraqi to do something
about the Cicero gang directly deputized

173
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,890
70 Chicago cops. He went into Cicero in
plain clothes and unmarked black sedans.

174
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,350
They seem spotted frank Capone on the
street going in down Widleen his body with

175
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,273
bullets.

176
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,650
When our heard about
his brothers sleeping,

177
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,700
all of the sophistication that Tario
had imbued him over the last year was

178
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:38,530
ripped away. His savage nature was
unleashed as he vowed to take revenge.

179
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,410
It's a goal of torreos persuasive
skill to keep it in check,

180
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,550
but I he was not able to keep Capone
out of a spotlight staying in the

181
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:49,280
backgrounds having als mines. It cost
them life of his brother. Sorry. No,

182
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,920
he continued to preach nonviolence.

183
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,840
You're resorting to brute force when all
else fails, but the name of Al Capone,

184
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,390
well that was synonymous with violence.

185
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,140
This is something that's pretty well
illustrated in contemporary culture.

186
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,510
We've got a clip here,
thanks to boardwalk empire

187
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,080
pretty nicely sums up
how we see al Capone.

188
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,420
Now try as he might to
follow these leaders.

189
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:23,980
Advice component was plagued by mayhem
and a temporary found difficult to

190
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:24,700
control.

191
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,930
AL's based nature was combative rather
than diplomatic and it resulted in an

192
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,420
awful lot of bloodshed in
the years that were to come.

193
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,360
Alice pent up emotions over the
death of his brother. Frank,

194
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,800
we're given expression on the evening of
May the eighth I'm 1924 his partner in

195
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:43,270
a prostitution ring jacket music had
been roughed up by an Irish target named

196
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,400
Joe Howard fault,
refusing him alone,

197
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,480
composing immediately tracked down
Howard in a bar and demanded to know what

198
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:50,190
it's happens.

199
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,460
Howard took one look and Capone calls him
a Daigo pimp and then told them to get

200
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,090
lost.

201
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,560
At this point is Capone pulls out his
pistol and shot Howard in the face and he

202
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,870
did this in front of dozens of witnesses.

203
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,790
The more it never convicted out for
this breeze is murder, but the press,

204
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,750
they sat and he did the original
story identifying him as our Brown,

205
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,520
but when it was picked up by other papers,

206
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,740
it was corrected to Alphonse component.

207
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,850
This was really the beginning of his
public persona and when he became famous

208
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:24,300
for it,

209
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,590
less than a year later in January of
1925 Johnny Tario was ambushed by rival

210
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:29,400
gang members.

211
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,420
He came within an inch of losing his
life surviving and we need to have a nine

212
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,780
month prison terms slapped on him
for operating an illegal brewery.

213
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,230
While so he decided that he'd had
enough of the Chicago madness.

214
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,430
By the end of that year,

215
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,790
it completely handed the reins
over to Capone and he disappeared.

216
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,443
Okay.

217
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,810
He inherited the goals of mine from
Johnny Tario that was fueled by a highly

218
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:57,680
organized operation that operated
largely behind the scenes. In fact,

219
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,740
the duplicity was so complete that 99%
of the citizens of Cicero never even saw

220
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,130
a gangster,

221
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,640
rather than I'll be used the government
to control the area with noncompliant

222
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:11,600
merchants being plagued with higher taxes
and loss of parking in front of their

223
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:15,260
stores, but they quickly got the
message and they got into line

224
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,290
now component set his sights on the north
side of Chicago to make some headway.

225
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,100
He first had to subjugate the
deadliest gang Chicago ever known.

226
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,780
The generous they operated in the open,
even having police protection.

227
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,920
The Jenna's also had been major
suppliers of alcohol to the Tario Capone

228
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,130
[inaudible] and it's Capone heard even
supported them in their battles with

229
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:42,790
other gangs. But after crushing
the rivalry, Banyan Gang,

230
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,850
the Germans decided to take
over the Capone empire.

231
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,860
It would prove to be their undoing.

232
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,280
The Jenna's selected a couple of
Sicilians to assassinate Capone,

233
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,280
however it recognizing
components power and fearful.

234
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,740
That's such an attempt would
lead to that own demise.

235
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,070
The Sicilian duo informed Capone
of the Jenna's intentions,

236
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,580
how convinced them to turn on
the janitors and in short order,

237
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:07,720
they had killed three of the Gen ed
brothers, the remaining three brothers,

238
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,150
while they fled to Sicily
with the Jana as well.

239
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,710
They were out of the way to play it now,

240
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,780
how to deal with the survivors of the
O'bannon gang who had rated components,

241
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,390
headquarters and number of times on one
particular occasion there to use eight

242
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,200
touring costs.

243
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,040
They first shot blanks to newer people
outside and then followed with a live

244
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:28,600
ammunition like kill the
Capone on the spot. There is,
well, it didn't work though.

245
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,860
Over 1000 rounds were fired.
Miraculously. No one was killed.

246
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,420
I was convinced that the brain's buying
this attempted hit was Hymie Weiss

247
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,530
leader of the Albanian gang. Anti
immediately ordered the death of this man.

248
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,340
They hit men,

249
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,340
set themselves up across from Weiss's
flower shop and waited and waited and

250
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,160
waited. After a week they finally
spotted Weiss walking towards his shop.

251
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,580
They killed him and free of his body
guards successfully stepping into the

252
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,490
vacuum created by the killing of Hymie.
Weiss was bugs.

253
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:02,480
Moron who was eager to get rid
of Capone as why is it been more,

254
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,830
has plenty of guts but little common
sense. He publicly denounced hipbone,

255
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,210
especially for paddling bad women and
bad alcohol constantly on the attack.

256
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,380
Moran's troops launched in number of
forays against Capone's businesses.

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,630
By February of 1929
campaign has had enough.

258
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,560
He ordered a massive hit on Capone to
take place on some Valentine's date

259
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,160
because this guy is does policemen and
did Moran's warehouse and caught the

260
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,520
seven victims off guard facing them
towards the wall as if they're going to

261
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:36,580
frisk them. They then move them
down with machine gun. Fire

262
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,290
around was not among them this attack,
but it was enough to scare him off.

263
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,010
Having eliminates is all opposition
on the north side of Chicago.

264
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,750
Deponent now focused on the south after
a number of killings. His rivals, well,

265
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,590
they sued for peace, agreeing to give
owl in large slice of their operation.

266
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,700
My March of 1929 Al Capone,

267
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,780
he was the undisputed king of Chicago
being portrayed to the public as the

268
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:06,740
ultimate Gangsta.

269
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,910
Yet at the same time he was being
read the riot acts by his peers.

270
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,810
The years the leaders of organized crime
had been holding annual meetings to

271
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:19,370
discuss matters of mutual concern. Now
the matter of mutual concern, well,

272
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,810
it was what to do with Al Capone.

273
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,530
Al Had attracted a tremendous amount
of unwanted attention with the St

274
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:26,000
Valentine's Day massacre.

275
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,630
He was bringing too much unwanted
attention as the king as well.

276
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,030
All the time had come for
him to be neutralized.

277
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,800
The commission decreed that Joseph,

278
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:38,270
Elio and old enemy of Capone would be
put in place in Chicago to keep our in

279
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:41,660
check. The poem would also have
to see it as gambling operations.

280
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:42,494
To the commission.

281
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,010
Capone was privately outraged that the
condition was muzzling him in this way,

282
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,250
but he was also smart enough
to know that if he protested,

283
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,080
he would quickly be eliminated.

284
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,080
He decided to take the advice of the
commission and line no for awhile and just

285
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,060
wash that away to safety line
low than from inside a jail cell.

286
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,570
Within 16 hours of coming out to the
commission meeting component had been

287
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,750
arrested for carrying a concealed weapon.

288
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,440
Deponent trusted is $50,000 diamond pinky
ring to his attorney with instructions

289
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:13,310
to give it to his brother Ralph, who would
become acting hedges until he returns.

290
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,380
He then began a 12 month JL town when
he emerged from his prison cell in March

291
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:22,070
of 1930 the pine discovered that
the climate's, it had changed.

292
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,820
He had been listed as public
enemy number one by the FBI.

293
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,170
The federal government now considered
him a menace to society and was prepared

294
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,050
to do anything to put
him behind bars for good.

295
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,800
It was certain that Al was violating
the Volstead act by selling liquor,

296
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,180
but they were not able to prove it. Not
even Elliot Ness. Auntie's untouchables,

297
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,310
were able to stop the pain.
Finally,

298
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:46,880
the FBI decided that their best chance
at putting the phone away was to

299
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,500
convicted of tax evasion,

300
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,780
was used to being cheered when
he attended public events,

301
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,380
but now that the government was bringing
income tax evasion charges against him

302
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,260
crowds, they started booing. Yeah.

303
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,130
What's worse is formerly failproof
methods of fixing the outcomes of trials.

304
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,850
They were having no effects. Owl did
manage to bribe several jury members,

305
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,120
but on the day of the trial,
the judge switched the jury panel.

306
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,200
From that moment on,

307
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,620
Virginia's were sequestered and they
were out of Al's reach after presenting a

308
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,640
damaged case, which highlighted
a life of lavish spending,

309
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,620
yet virtually no tax payments.

310
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,750
The prosecution concluded by reminding
the jury that Capone was no Robin Hood.

311
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,280
He spent wildly on himself and his
cronies doing nothing to help the poor and

312
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,114
the down and out.

313
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,170
The judge found him guilty on three
counts of tax evasion and on October the

314
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:38,460
24th 1931 he was sentenced
to 11 years in prison.

315
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,200
This was the harshest sentence ever
handed down for tax evasion Capone. Well,

316
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,650
he felt that now his gangland
associates would rally to his age,

317
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,490
but he just didn't get it.
Maybe it has advancing syphilis.

318
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,510
It's something to do with this,

319
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,440
but the reality was that had been artfully
shunted aside at the Atlantic City

320
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,500
meeting in 1929 now two years later,

321
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,430
it was life was out in the open for all
to see and he had a felony conviction to

322
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:07,240
his name. He was anathema to his format
gangland buddies. They ignored it.

323
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,980
Deponent spent most of his time in an
Atlanta prison and then spent the last

324
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:14,310
three years of his sentence of Alcatraz.
By then his syphilis,

325
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,500
it's serious and eroded
his mental faculties.

326
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,030
By the time he died of cardiac arrest
on January the 25th of 1947 doctors

327
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:24,630
concluded that he had the mind
of a 12 year old child and well,

328
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,560
that was all for hours.

329
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,523
