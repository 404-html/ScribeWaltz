1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,500
She has one of the earliest serial
killers in recorded history.

2
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:06,500
The original sadomasochistic femme fatale.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,510
She stands out as a shocking
lesson in just down dangerous.

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,344
The sadistic,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,263
demented,

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,020
powerful women can be the passing
of the centuries has left us with an

7
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:17,480
incomplete picture of the
true nature of our crimes,

8
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:21,680
but what we do know is truly stomach
Channing and this week's biographics.

9
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:25,070
We pair into the depraved
life of the blood count tests.

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,450
Elizabeth battery.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,113
Okay.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,630
The women we know is Elizabeth Bathory.

13
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:45,631
It was born as early a bit Bathory on
August the seventh 1560 in nearby store in

14
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,630
the Kingdom of Hungary.

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,260
She was born into one of the most
prominent families in central Europe.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,951
As a result,

17
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:54,340
she was lavished with the very best
education in classical upbringing.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
During our formative years,

19
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,680
she learned to speak Hungarian,

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,280
Slovak,

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,790
Greek,

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,480
Latin,

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,290
and German.

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,840
Elizabeth was a child with
severe health problems.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,770
Historians have speculated that the fact
that her parents were first cousins may

26
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:10,771
have contributed to how weak constitution
she was an epileptic and as such was

27
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:11,830
prone to violence,

28
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,664
seizures.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,020
It has been recorded that young Elizabeth
was exposed to all sorts of horrific

30
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,940
atrocities during her formative years.

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,420
She has said to have begun laughing
at the site of a man who's crime was

32
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,810
stealing being soon into
the body of a horse.

33
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,010
She would also regularly witness the
severe beatings of servants unlike other

34
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:30,561
young girls.

35
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,760
So Elizabeth was not offended
by the violence that she saw.

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,690
In fact,

37
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,980
she seemed to be drawn to it.

38
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,940
By the age of 10 she had become a
rather stunningly beautiful young lady.

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,080
It was then that she became engaged to
a 15 year old Hungarian counts by the

40
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:47,140
name of fairing can Nadasky
as was the custom sheet,

41
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,520
moved into our future husbands,

42
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,220
parents palace and received education.

43
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:54,400
Then running the estates that were under
the control of her mother and yeah,

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,980
Legend has it that Elizabeth had
an affair with a hasn't bought,

45
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:04,340
you know,

46
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,020
early teens and became pregnant.

47
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,570
It is said that she gave
the child away secretly.

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,170
Meanwhile,

49
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,390
Aaron's is supposed to
have discovered the affair,

50
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,560
had the peasants castrated and
then thrown to a pack of wild dogs.

51
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,420
Whether this story is true or not,

52
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,000
it is clear that Elizabeth
was active sexually.

53
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,620
She married Ferenc on May the eighth
1574 when she was 14 the wedding,

54
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,890
it was an extravagance of fair with
four and a half thousand people in

55
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,550
attendance.

56
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,020
The party raged on for three days at the
height of which parents gifted his wife

57
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,520
with a castle of her own.

58
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,030
It just so happens to be
causal trash tits out,

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,180
one of the darkest,

60
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,850
most bleakly gothic
castle in all of Hungary.

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,600
The car situations in the literal
Carpathians and modern day Slovakia.

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,020
We're surrounded by a
village and farmland.

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,290
It would come to be the scene of
many of our most horrific crimes,

64
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,050
the marriage at United
to powerful families,

65
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:56,090
and it made them the
power couple of the day.

66
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,260
For the first few years,

67
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,850
Elizabeth was busy learning about and
overseeing the many estates that she

68
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,600
controls.

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,910
Her husband was off fighting
against the Ottomans.

70
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,710
He proved to be a great warrior,

71
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,551
noting himself.

72
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,290
The nickname of the black
knight of Hungary is absolute
brutality in the face of

73
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:11,800
the enemy.

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,770
Terrified his enemies
since shocked his allies.

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,870
The Turks invaded Hungary in 1591
precipitating what had become known as the

76
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,531
long war,

77
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:25,531
which lasted from 1593 to 1606 the wall
was to drag on severely depleting the

78
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,030
Hungarian economy.

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,630
However,

80
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,010
Elizabeth Bathory never felt the pinch
because a husband kept showering her with

81
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,450
gifts from the Ottoman Empire.

82
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:34,871
In fact,

83
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,900
a couple of groups so wealthy that during
this time they actually lends money,

84
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,560
do the Hungarian Habsburg Empire
to keep the country a flute.

85
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,190
During the war years cashed it
set was threatened by the tax.

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,000
Elizabeth had to defend her husband's
estate since she did so effectively at

87
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:49,351
times.

88
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:53,200
Street also gave refuge to desperate
peasants feeding and housing them.

89
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,150
Over the first few
years of their marriage.

90
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,520
Elizabeth and foreigns didn't
spend much time together.

91
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,940
When they did it said they bonded
over their love of violence.

92
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,150
Torturing young servant girls
see were under their charge.

93
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,410
Ferentz taught his teenage wife innovative
methods of torture such as rolling up

94
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,280
pieces of oils,

95
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,760
paper,

96
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,600
placing it in between the toes of a
seven girl and then setting it on fire.

97
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,350
It was also claims that he gave Elizabeth
the Claude Glove for her to scratch up

98
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,570
the faces of disobedient girls.

99
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,010
There is no doubt that a husband
introduced Elizabeth Duke or manner of

100
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:24,844
atrocity,

101
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,850
but there was another evil influence
in 1601 the household was joined by a

102
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,550
strange woman by the
name of Anna Doll Volya.

103
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,500
It was rumored that she was a witch.

104
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,760
What is undeniable though,

105
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,730
is that Elizabeth's personality underwear.

106
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:41,440
It's a dramatic change
from the time the Darboy.

107
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah,

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and to the household.

109
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,950
She became much more sadistic,

110
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,220
whereas the husband taught her to
torture Anna towards her to kill.

111
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,090
Under the sinister to Jovana,

112
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,150
Elizabeth was responsible for the
deaths of several of her servants.

113
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:00,984
Around this time,

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,940
the disappearances of the girls raised
new eyebrows as peasants were completely

115
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,200
disposable at that time and place.

116
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,160
Any questions that were raised by
family members were squelched quickly by

117
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,870
virtue of the huge power that the
battery family hat Elizabeth was in all

118
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,610
practical tans untouchable.

119
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,580
She could torture and kill
to our heart's delight.

120
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,060
Even the power of the family though
could not prevent the reamers.

121
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,550
Local pastors became
increasingly suspicious.

122
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:29,940
There's Elizabeth more frequently asked
them to come to the castle to perform a

123
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:33,360
funeral rites for serving girls
who had apparently died of cholera.

124
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,280
It is recorded that one priest,

125
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,380
after having attended too many funerals,

126
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:38,820
pulled her aside and said to her,

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,450
your grace should not have acted so
because it offends the Lord and we will be

128
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:46,350
punished if we do not complain
to you and criticize your grace,

129
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,330
and in order to find my words aren't true,

130
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:53,250
we need only exume the body and you will
find that the marks identify the way in

131
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:54,360
which death occurred.

132
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,470
Elizabeth was outraged
that the priest would deck.

133
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,400
He was there in this Nana.

134
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,580
She threatens that she
had powerful relatives.

135
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,120
He would not tolerate such talk.

136
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,890
She then stormed out of the charge,

137
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,430
leaving it for her husband to smooth
things over with the priest together.

138
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:11,120
The murderous couple had five known
children with the youngest being born in

139
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,830
1598 around 60 no one Elizabeth's
husband ferrets became unwell.

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,500
We don't know the specific
nature of his condition,

141
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,000
but it led to paralysis.

142
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:20,720
If the legs,

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,200
he died in 1604 bringing their 29 year
marriage to an ends at the time of her

144
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,034
husband's death.

145
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,160
Elisabeth was 44 years of age.

146
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,120
The loss of her husband cost
another noticeable change,

147
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:40,690
and Elizabeth Sevens notice that
she became even more sadistic.

148
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,770
The stress of having to take the reigns
of an extensive Ambar was no doubt a

149
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,760
contributing factor.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,800
It appears that she now transformed our
pension for sadism from a hobby into a

151
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,330
full time preoccupation,

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,360
specifically Eby torture and murder of
young women with almost 407 girls savor

153
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,460
the banks with our vast remains.

154
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,390
Elizabeth had no shortage of victims,

155
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,051
of course,

156
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:02,771
killing our staff.

157
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:05,530
It was a bit of a hassle as him
and that she had to replace them.

158
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,100
So she increasingly began to lure
girls from the villages surrounding our

159
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:09,934
castles.

160
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,520
When she had had her fill of
torturing these unfortunates,

161
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:16,420
they would be flying over the castle
walls to be ripped to pieces by wolves.

162
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,870
Elizabeth built up a loyal team of
sycophancy facilitated have murderous

163
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,590
actions.

164
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,200
I know Delvoye.

165
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,391
Yeah.

166
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:31,610
Was her main accomplice also
brought into these statistics cycle?

167
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,710
Was the nurse who looked
after the children,

168
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,780
a woman by the name of a year and a Joe.

169
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,630
There was also a friend of hers
involved by the name of [inaudible].

170
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,180
There was also a washer
woman by the name of Katelyn,

171
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,130
the most sinister of the helpers,

172
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,780
Anna and darker,

173
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,680
who would try to outdo each other
and inflicting pain on their victims.

174
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,450
The youngest of the murderous clan was
a disfigured team by the name of fit

175
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,284
Skyrim.

176
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,930
The typical progression of a seven girl
into this horror would begin with a

177
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
simple mistake and the
performance of her duties.

178
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,970
This could be as menial
as missing a stitch,

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,610
the counts as if she was
present with fixing evil,

180
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:05,570
stare on the girl,

181
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,201
yell at her,

182
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,170
and then begin snapping her arounds.

183
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,821
Elizabeth,

184
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,370
the device,

185
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,840
all manner of creative punishments to
go with specific misdemeanors and eagles

186
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,830
who made a mistake in any kind of sewing
would be stabbed repeatedly with it.

187
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,040
Long sewing needles.

188
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,790
Usually girls would be stripped
naked before they were tortured.

189
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,320
Elizabeth reveled in inflicting
psychological torture on the victims after

190
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,330
sticking to needles into
the fingers of a girl.

191
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,164
She would comment,

192
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,580
if it hurts the whore,

193
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,690
she can pull it out.

194
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,340
The girl would naturally take,

195
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:36,260
this is permission to pull the needle out.

196
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,160
But when she did,

197
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,100
Elizabeth would pull out a
knife and cut the finger off.

198
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,720
She was also known to have at least one
occasion bitten a chunk of flesh from

199
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,190
the face of one of her victims.

200
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,430
Services would be lucky to get
away with a lost finger or two.

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
More often than not,

202
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:54,290
the blood lust within the deprived
heart of the Countess was unable to be

203
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:54,920
quelled.

204
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,180
The girls would be dragged
off to a torture chamber
where Elizabeth employee to

205
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,830
torture squad to carry out
much of her daddy work.

206
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,670
All manner of implements were made you
soft cause the most gruesome afflictions

207
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,380
imaginable.

208
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,220
Pins says we used to rip flesh insides
were torn out and there there've even

209
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:13,500
been reports that cannibalism was
enforced on some of the girls.

210
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,950
We know certain details of what took
place in the torture chambers of the

211
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:21,090
battery castles because of investigation
and trial transcripts that occurred

212
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,690
when face eventually caught up with
Elizabeth Bathory in our accomplices.

213
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,380
However,

214
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,920
over the centuries the legends took over
and many of the crimes attributed to

215
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:29,250
her.

216
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:29,821
Oh yeah.

217
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:30,630
Fiction.

218
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,290
Perhaps the most pervasive belief is that
she had blood drained from virgins and

219
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,470
would bathe in us in order to
preserve her youthful beauty.

220
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,140
This story is almost certainly,

221
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm sure you've not one of these seven
girls who've testified against bathroom.

222
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,280
He mentioned anything to do with the
practice rather accounts after accounts

223
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,550
mentions that the floors of the
torture chambers were covered in blood,

224
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,260
which they would then have to clean up.

225
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,430
The counters showed absolutely no interest
in preserving the blood as part of

226
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:01,350
some narcissistic beauty regime by 1609
the rumors of what we're taking place at

227
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,240
the battery castles were rife,

228
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,060
but there was nothing the law
could do to put a stop to it.

229
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,751
At that time,

230
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:09,540
peasants were unable to
bring charges against nobles.

231
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,860
Some parents even looked at the demented
counters as a source of ready revenue

232
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,920
selling their children to have
for a lump sum on the face of it,

233
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,140
the trade was made to
provide seven duties,

234
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,090
but if the child was to die of cholera,

235
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,280
what of it Elizabeth?

236
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,380
Appetite for blood was insatiable.

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,280
The bodies were piling up at such a rate
that how group of enablers web running

238
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,600
out of places to bury them.

239
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,380
Many of the girls were placed in shallow
graves and the costs or courtyards,

240
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:39,220
and some of them were dug up by hungry
dogs by the beginning of 1,609 and this

241
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,020
is what's closest confidant and adopt.

242
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,800
Valia died of a stroke
around this same time,

243
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:44,100
Huh?

244
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,130
Debts began to mounts with all of
the children grown and married.

245
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:50,190
The counters fell into a spiral
of loneliness and depression.

246
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,210
For some reason,

247
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,480
Elizabeth decided that she needed
to find a better class of victim.

248
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,770
We don't really know why,

249
00:10:55,771 --> 00:11:00,450
but the general belief is that a lady
steward as the major rover who many

250
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,740
believe to be or which convinced her
that if she took the lives of noble girls

251
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:09,600
how financial fortunes with turn arounds
or it may simply have been that she was

252
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,310
running out of peasant victims.

253
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,260
Whatever the reason for the change it led
to Elizabeth to the decision to open a

254
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,390
finishing school for young women.

255
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,380
It would be the perfect cover for her
to continue her torture us ways with a

256
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,580
higher class of victim.

257
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,451
At the same time,

258
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:28,290
the attendance fees that the parents of
the girls paid would infuse some much

259
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,680
needed funds into the battery coffers.

260
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,600
Bye Now as appeared that Elizabeth is
insatiable need to kill the young girls

261
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,680
and led to the depths of insanity.

262
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,570
It's certainly clouded our reasoning.

263
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,570
It was obvious that the aristocratic
parents of teenage girls who suddenly

264
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,490
disappeared would move heaven and
earth to get to the bottom of what had

265
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,130
happened to their pride and joy,

266
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,840
but none of that mattered to Elizabeth.

267
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,220
All she saw was a ready
supply of nubile young bodies.

268
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,300
Inevitably the body counts began
adding up and the parents came calling

269
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,820
Elizabeth May dumped the
bizarrest of excuses.

270
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,700
One of the girls had gone crazy and
killed the other girls before committing

271
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:10,534
suicide,

272
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,220
but no one was convinced.

273
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,210
Some parents appeal to the King Mathius
the second and he decided to undertake

274
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:17,110
an investigation.

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,160
The official Raul investigation was put
into the hands of the king's highest

276
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,610
ranking representative [inaudible].

277
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,090
This man happened to be one of Elizabeth's
dead husband's closest associates on

278
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:31,840
his deathbed friends that even
asked us to look out for his wife.

279
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,400
However,

280
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,130
there's his loyalty to the king was
stronger than that of his old friend.

281
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,611
Still,

282
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,270
he treated Elizabeth with a level of
respect that she would not have otherwise

283
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,260
have received that.

284
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,030
As I began to interview witnesses,

285
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,400
he soon had dozens of people
that you testified to.

286
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,900
The counters is depraved ways.

287
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,641
Seven zoo,

288
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,660
it managed to get out of
the cost of their lives.

289
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,490
Spoke of seeing blood drenched wools,

290
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,570
hearing terrible screams and noticing the
ever growing readymade cemetery in the

291
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:56,620
castle courtyard.

292
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,280
However,

293
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,150
none of the people that Thursday spoke
to you was an actual eye witness of the

294
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:01,840
torture.

295
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Thursday you became convinced
of Elizabeth skills.

296
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,470
However,

297
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,100
he felt terrible about the pledge that
he had made to his dying friends that he

298
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,540
would account for his widow.

299
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,890
He decided to write,

300
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,650
do Elizabeth's relatives
and ask for advice.

301
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,310
A secret agreement was reached by which
the as it would be able to complete his

302
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,240
investigation,

303
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,000
but Elizabeth would never
be brought to trial.

304
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,420
She would go direct need to prison without
the embarrassment and the family that

305
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,920
a public trial would bring.

306
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,280
It's interesting to note
that none of batteries,

307
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,830
relatives argued that she was
innocent by December of 16,

308
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:33,230
10,

309
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,580
Thursday,

310
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,490
believed that he had enough
evidence to arrest Elizabeth,

311
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,500
but he wanted to make absolutely sure.

312
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,220
Therefore,

313
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,420
he had himself in the king,

314
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:44,470
invited to dine at Battery Castle and
Elizabeth was forensically nervous,

315
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,520
but she tried to act.

316
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,240
The gracious hostess things went
well until she saved the men.

317
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:49,511
Uh,

318
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,890
post dinner dessert,

319
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,840
a cake on first divide.

320
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,370
The men began to feel unwell,

321
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,950
convinced that the contest
had tried to poison them.

322
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,420
They may just be the accent.

323
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,381
On New Year's Eve,

324
00:13:59,381 --> 00:13:59,861
16,

325
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:00,161
10,

326
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:03,340
Thursday returned with a
contingent of armed guards.

327
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,160
They had outside the castle gates and
wait it before a long Elizabeth and our

328
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:10,720
lady Stewart as the major river
came out to Costa Protective,

329
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,140
spelled designed to protect the
countess and bringing about the death of

330
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,980
investigator.

331
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,790
Thursday.

332
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,970
Thursday one is men listens
to the women's incantations.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,110
When the two went inside,

334
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,840
the investigators crept
towards the is entranceway.

335
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,680
They immediately noticed the mutilated
body of a young girl and near the doorway

336
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,100
to more were found just inside.

337
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,210
They then heard the sounds of screaming,

338
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,710
which led them to the torture chamber.

339
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,190
It was there that they discovered
Elizabeth's murder team harder at work.

340
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,910
It is unclear whether the Thursday
actually caught Elizabeth in the act of

341
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:40,570
torture.

342
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,050
However,

343
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,090
he was now convinced if that guilt,

344
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,580
the contest was found
and taken into custody.

345
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
She immediately claimed their innocence,

346
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,690
blaming everything on her servants.

347
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,111
Those,

348
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,390
uh,

349
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,020
wasn't moved.

350
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,411
However,

351
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,990
and see through Elizabeth
into her own dungeon.

352
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,920
In the end,

353
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,380
306 people testified against Elizabeth.

354
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,250
Even the members of her murder grew
turned against a incriminating themselves.

355
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,084
In the process.

356
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,150
The total reported murder counts
varies between 80 and 650 batteries.

357
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,200
Accomplices were put on trial in January
of 1611 scores of witnesses and even

358
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,450
some surviving victims
took to the witness stands.

359
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,290
The judges is also examined some of the
cadavers that had been taken from the

360
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,120
battery consuls death
sentences were passed down to
I own a Joe Dorko and Fisco.

361
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,200
Prior to their executions I own a Jo
Anne Dorko were given that own form of

362
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:27,740
torture.

363
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,700
Their fingers were torn out by iron tongs
before they were put to death and then

364
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,750
tossed on a bonfire.

365
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,330
FISCO was spared this
torture due to his youth.

366
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,880
Instead it was beheaded and then burns.

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,550
Catelynn was the only one
who was not put to death.

368
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,940
She had been the most softhearted
of the bunch on several occasions.

369
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,120
She herself had been beaten for
sneaking food in for the victims.

370
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,280
She was sentenced to life imprisonment.

371
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,081
That was,

372
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,690
I kept his word to Elizabeth
and she was never put on trial.

373
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,300
She was convicted and sentenced to
life imprisonment in our own castle.

374
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:06,130
A confined to one of the dungeons
which had been the scene of some of her

375
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,810
atrocities are only visitors,

376
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,150
were priests and the man
who had put him behind boss.

377
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,010
That was like the Kyries reported that
she was unrepentant and crazed with rage.

378
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,030
None of the priests was able to get it
to acknowledge the severity of our crimes

379
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:22,000
and she continued to insist
that it was a assistance.

380
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,540
Who are the real criminals are priests
challenge tower as to why she didn't

381
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,380
order them to stop.

382
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,330
She said that she had been afraid of them.

383
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,660
Elizabeth reserve the greatest
animosity for Thursday.

384
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,130
At one point when he came to see her,

385
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:37,520
she began to subjects him to an awful
harangue at which points and to Jack did.

386
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,820
You are in the last months of your life.

387
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,780
You do not deserve to breathe the air on
the earth or see the light of the Lord.

388
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,800
You shall disappear from this world and
never really it again as the shadows and

389
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,570
develop you.

390
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,580
May you find time to repent,

391
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,110
you'll be steal life.

392
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,310
Elizabeth Bathory complained to a guard
that she had cold hands on October the

393
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:01,450
21st 1614 he told us to go lie
down and tried to get some sleep.

394
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,673
She did,

395
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,670
and she never woke up.

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,250
Her body was buried in the
cemetery at [inaudible],

397
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,660
but it said that it didn't remain there
long due to local uproar at the outrage

398
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:12,940
of having such a murderous
buried in their midst.

399
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,390
The body was supposedly exhumed
and taken to the battery family,

400
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:16,900
Krebs.

401
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,291
However,

402
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,980
when the crypt was opened in 1995
the corpse of Hungary's most infamous

403
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,860
murderous was nowhere to be seen.

404
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,900
So I'm not going to ask

405
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:27,550
