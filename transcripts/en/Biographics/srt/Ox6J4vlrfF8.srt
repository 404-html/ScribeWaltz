1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,210
During the Holocaust.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,320
It was a cock lived in the book and wild
concentration camp with our husbands.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,100
She would order the deaths of prisoners
at a will and even enjoyed watching

4
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:13,000
people being tortured and kills
her home was filled with momentos,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,750
made from human skin and it was a call
come had been responsible for more deaths

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,100
than your average serial killer.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,521
Indeed,

8
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:22,270
she is considered to be one of the
most evil women that ever lived

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,630
bone with a maiden name.

10
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,610
Margaret also color her life,

11
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,110
had humble beginnings in Dresden,

12
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:40,610
Germany as the trials.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,600
No one could have ever guessed that she
would grow up to be such an evil person.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,610
Neighbor say that she was a friendly,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,740
happy girl and she was popular in school.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,030
Her father was a laborer and her mother
was a housewife just like on the German

17
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:53,601
girl Zillow.

18
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,900
Zillow would have known to cook and
clean and take care of a household.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,400
She left school to start working at a
cigarette factory fulltime when she was 15

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,470
she began taking classes in accounting.

21
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,930
It's a local college and
and bookkeeping position.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,270
It also joined the Nazi
party very early on,

23
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,460
most likely because she
came from a poor family.

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,360
The Nazis promise the lower class that
they could help bring Germany out of the

25
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:18,200
economic depression that they were
experiencing off to world war one.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,210
For people who are poor and an educated
fascism seems like a solution to the

27
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,200
country's problems.

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,700
I said began to believe in the ideals of
an area in master race and Shannon that

29
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,170
feelings of antisemitism.

30
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,310
She mentioned like minded men who would
become a future husbands call a cock.

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,760
He was nine years older than El Sarah
and had already gone through a divorce

32
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,970
from his first wife who disagreed
with his Nazi philosophies.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,200
He had a criminal record for theft and
he and his brother grew up working as

34
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,400
informants for the police.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,850
There's life of grime was
actually something that
builds the thought was quite

36
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:53,810
attractive and they were married
in 1936 often Hitler came to power.

37
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:58,040
The couple were rewarded for being early
adopters of Nazi-ism went from being a

38
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,730
petty criminal to being handed a
position as a high ranking ss officer.

39
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,810
The two of them that have a up with any
sort of wealth and they suddenly had the

40
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,000
opportunity to become rich and powerful,

41
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,240
and so they took advantage
of it to its fullest extent.

42
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,800
Before he was put in charge
of a concentration camp,

43
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,380
Carl Koch was the warden
of a prison in Berlin.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,490
He would force prisoners deep stuff
themselves into dog houses and eat out of

45
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,210
bowls.

46
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,690
They were supposed to kneel
and Bach when coke was around.

47
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,680
If they refuse,

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,460
they will be soon.

49
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,810
If a man did something wrong,

50
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,940
hot tar was shoved up his backside.

51
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,170
This sadistic torture was noted by the
Nazis and they thought his unique skill

52
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:40,520
set,

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,520
it could be useful of running
a camp filled with the
enemies of the Third Reich.

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,521
It was a cock,

55
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,780
wasn't turned off by the brutal
reputation that her husband had.

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,680
In fact,

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,880
she loved us and she wants it to be a
part of the process as much as her husband

58
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,210
did.

59
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,300
When she found out they were going to be
running a concentration camp together.

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,920
She even got some practice
where I get to prison camp,

61
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,880
cold Sachsenhausen Call Elsa Coq.

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,190
One interesting charge of managing
the book involves concentration camp.

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,590
They were there during
the construction of it,

64
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,350
the gate to the camp red yet m dust sign,

65
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,210
which means to each his own.

66
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,270
What they meant by this was that
everyone gets what's coming to them.

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,500
This was their own personal touch to
rabbit into the faces of those people who

68
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,550
they truly believed.

69
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,920
Does it have to be treated
less than human beings?

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,270
Book involved was the largest of all the
Nazi concentration camps and yet there

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,840
were no gas chambers for killing
people quickly and efficiently.

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,930
This camp was mainly there to
use the prisoners as slave labor,

73
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,120
making things that were
useful to the Third Reich.

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,700
Prisoners in book involves
were kept alive for years,

75
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,070
which was a lot longer than it.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,120
Other concentration camps in Auschwitz.

77
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:43,661
For example,

78
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:48,220
the average lifespan was Amea three to
four months while they were building the

79
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,880
camp bills and request the family must
live in a mansion which was built on the

80
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,760
same property as the concentration
camp in Nazi Germany.

81
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,670
Men and women were given set
roles to play in society.

82
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,850
The perfect gentleman woman was
supposed to be happy to do housework.

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,660
She was supposed to stay strong in the
face of adversity and always loyal to her

84
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
husband's high ranking
leaders in the Nazi policy.

85
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,820
We're expected to be a
good example of this.

86
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,620
Wives of SNS offices were not expected
to do the work as much as a common German

87
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:14,950
women,

88
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,340
but it also Cochran Kritika new
life of luxury to the next level.

89
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,640
She aims to have a life where she
never had to do any housework.

90
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,810
She decided that the prisoners from the
concentration camps would be how slaves.

91
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,900
She forced everyone to address
Sarah as Kinetica Frau,

92
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,230
which is an old fashioned to,

93
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:32,890
I'm usually reserved
for ladies of nobility.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,380
Elsa never lifted a finger
to do anything herself,

95
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,420
which may to grow bored with her life.

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,260
She decided that the prisoners should
build out a huge indoor sports arena.

97
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,180
They looked worthy of an Olympic event.

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,990
This was used just so she could
practice a hobby of horseback riding.

99
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,680
It costs over 200,000
Reichsmarks to bills today.

100
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,350
That would be about the
equivalent of $1 million,

101
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,640
but all of this back riding,

102
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,890
it wasn't enough to satisfy a boredom.

103
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,730
There was a rule in the camp that if any
prisoner even looked at the commander's

104
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,300
wife,

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
they would be shot on the spot.

106
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,400
Knowing this Elsa Cochran,

107
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,400
again dressing provocatively on purpose,

108
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,180
she wore tight clothing and reveal
to our cleavage on a daily basis.

109
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,560
Most wives of the SS officers and the
other concentration can never go to

110
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:18,760
involved with the prisoners and where
most likely in some sorts of denial about

111
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,540
what was going on,

112
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,373
but it was the cock.

113
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,740
She wanted to get involved and she
relished in the fact that people were

114
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,110
starving and dying all around time.

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,170
Elsa was about some reds hatch.

116
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:32,140
He thought a lot of ourself witnesses
say that when her husband was away,

117
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,980
it'll sokak would come on to the officers
to bring out a group of male soldiers

118
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,590
and forced them to undress until
they were completely naked.

119
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,610
She would all say stripped down to our
lingerie and loud in front of a yard of

120
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,140
sec staff to male prisoners.

121
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,580
If any of them even glanced at her
about eur uncontrollably became aroused.

122
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,820
He was immediately taken by
the gods and shot in the hat.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,240
She specifically requested to have
teenage boys working in our home.

124
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,120
Seven so you lived in house say that she
was holding them to bring her breakfast

125
00:05:59,121 --> 00:05:59,750
in bed.

126
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,690
She would be laying in bed
wearing nothing but a nightie,

127
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,140
just like the men in the yards.

128
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,050
If they even dads look at that body.

129
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,560
It was grounds for them being
killed considering they were well,

130
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,460
teenage boys,

131
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,790
it's very possible that some of them
simply couldn't help get aroused.

132
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,230
Even if they hated our guts.

133
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,520
Based on these stories,

134
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:20,510
we can make the assumption that she was
a sexual sadist who is aroused by the

135
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,790
idea of inflicting pain upon other people.

136
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,841
One of the households,

137
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,411
sevens,

138
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,860
Eric Hush was just 15 years
old at the time that he works,

139
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,160
that he said that the coc dimension
was on the edge of the camp,

140
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:35,480
so he was able to look out the window
and see free people beyond the fence

141
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,190
watching people go about their lives.

142
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:41,810
It felt like looking at some kind of
fantasy and t often fails envious and sad.

143
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,730
Wondering why he wasn't so lucky.

144
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,970
Elsa cock allowed him to each
two boiled potatoes every Sunday.

145
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,910
He would carry them back to the barracks
where the other prisoners were staying.

146
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,150
He didn't like eating potato skins so
it would peel them off and throw them on

147
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:53,541
the grounds,

148
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,374
but once he did that,

149
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,910
several other prisoners jumped on the
pills because they were so desperate for

150
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:58,110
it

151
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,943
figures.

152
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,150
All Nazi concentration camps had some
form of human experimentation going on and

153
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,040
work involved was no exception.

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,230
Doctors at the camp were poisoning people
with deadly chemicals in order to find

155
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,380
potential antidotes and they
were injecting homosexuals
with concoctions that

156
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,120
were believed to turn them straight.

157
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,440
Soon enough,

158
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,910
teasing then was not enough to satiate
hills is boredom and she wanted to watch

159
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,830
the doctor's conduct these experiments.

160
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,830
She saw this as an opportunity
to have a new hobby.

161
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,740
She wrote a story through the camp and
notice that some of the prisoners had

162
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,390
really interesting tattoos.

163
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,130
She approached one of the camp doctors,

164
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:38,911
Eric Wagner,

165
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:42,570
and suggested that he should conduct
a study to see if tattoos had any

166
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:44,130
correlation to criminal behavior.

167
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,940
Technically,

168
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,630
Dr. Wagner should have never said
yes because it was against protocol,

169
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,890
but he agreed to do it.

170
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,090
During these tests,

171
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:55,200
people were killed and their bodies were
taken away to be dissected so that Elsa

172
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,610
could keep this skin.

173
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,940
Also began writing a whole surround the
camp commodity men to stop what they

174
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:01,320
were doing and strip.

175
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,420
She would walk through
the lines of naked men,

176
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,400
sizing them up and examining their bodies.

177
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,030
But the ones with what she regarded as
the best tattoos were selected for the

178
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,620
medical trial and they were killed.

179
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,460
Their skin was used to cover a
lampshades knife sheaths and book covers.

180
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,060
She saw this as an opportunity to come
up with some original Christmas gifts and

181
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:21,660
commands and a group of Jewish prisoners
to do the work of creating huge

182
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:25,410
quantities of these trinkets made from
human leather during the holidays.

183
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:28,710
She would send them to ss officers who
were in charge of the other concentration

184
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:29,310
camps.

185
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,090
One Room even says that she used
human body parts all over our house,

186
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:35,820
like using thumbs as light switches.

187
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,980
According to prisoners
who worked in our house,

188
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:42,720
Elsa was having affairs with both Dr
Waldemar Hoeven and deputy commandant,

189
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:42,920
um,

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,590
and floor statue one call.

191
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,780
Cock was asked to leave.

192
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,400
The comfort is Nazi duties.

193
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,070
She would reportedly stay
overnight to doctor Hovind's home.

194
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,100
He was known for conducting medical
experiments on human beings.

195
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:58,101
So it was just a type when
cold cock contracted civil
se or did the execution of

196
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,900
the orderly who gave him his diagnosis.

197
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,770
He did not want anyone to know the
embarrassing truth about this marriage.

198
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,230
Some believe that they
had an open relationship

199
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,480
in 1942 both Carl and Elsa Kakoa taken
to courts misappropriating the funds of

200
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,270
the book involved camp and for the over
the top methods of torture if we're

201
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:22,811
being honest.

202
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:26,260
It's surprising that it took that long
for the Nazis to ask where the money came

203
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:30,070
from to build else's whole stadium
and for the lavish lifestyle that she

204
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,760
demanded.

205
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,390
Many of the human experiments going on
at Buka and roles were often made up on a

206
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:35,500
whim by the Cox.

207
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,490
This was not allowed in the audit to begin
a scientific trial would have to have

208
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,380
come from higher up in the Nazi party.

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,760
Medical experiments using human subjects
usually has an actual goal that would

210
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:46,331
help the Fed.

211
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:46,840
Right.

212
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,441
For example,

213
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:51,790
the experiments usually prove that areas
where the master race or the disabled

214
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,600
people who are somehow subhuman the
party wants to experiments that helps to

215
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,760
justify the genocide that
they were conducting,

216
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,690
the torturing and killing prisoners just
to look at their tattoos could ever be

217
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:03,790
justified from by the Nazis.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,060
The fact that it also was the one who
convinced the Dr. Wagner to disobey

219
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:09,670
protocol shows just how
manipulative she was.

220
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,630
She has every man in her life wrapped
around her finger and she seemed to take

221
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,320
no issue with ruining that career is if
it meant getting the things she wanted

222
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,990
often being removed from that post.

223
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,890
A man named Herman Pisco took over.

224
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,220
Book Involves Elsa,

225
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,051
has been called,

226
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:27,700
was put in jail awaiting their trial
in 1944 the cock sweat finally taken to

227
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:28,210
court.

228
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,130
The Nazi judge concluded that no matter
how manipulative Elsa may have been that

229
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,820
responsibility nade on Carl.

230
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:34,660
At the end of the day,

231
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,890
he was the Kimono or off roll and he
should've had the final say and both the

232
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,220
manner of killing and the
campus well as the use of funds.

233
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,460
The judge suspended the charges
against still syringe set.

234
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,420
A free call,

235
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:46,840
however,

236
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,890
was not so lucky.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,090
He was sentenced to death for his
crimes and in 1945 he was shot by firing

238
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:52,890
squad.

239
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,120
Elsa was free to go even though her
demands it directly contributed to our

240
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,000
husband's death.

241
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,900
She seemed to show no remorse and she
was even able to go back to living a

242
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,531
normal life.

243
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:05,080
In Germany with our three
children that same year,

244
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,330
American troops freed the
prisoners of bouquet involves,

245
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,320
they invited German people in Weimar to
come inside so that they could witness

246
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,670
what had been going on in the camp.

247
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,504
Right next door,

248
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,510
they saw 80,000 people crammed into a
space meant to house 8,000 corpses lying

249
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:23,380
around in front of the crematory and
American soldiers discovered a horrifying

250
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,190
collection of human body parts including
several human organs displayed inside

251
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,180
of gloss cases.

252
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,780
There was shrunken heads and they found
household items that were covered in

253
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,614
human skin.

254
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,480
The allies took testimonies from
prisoners who had lived in Bougainville

255
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:36,340
involved for years,

256
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:38,890
and when they heard the
stories of Elsa Cock,

257
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,200
she was arrested for
crimes against humanity.

258
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,060
At the trial,

259
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,240
it'll sir insisted that all of the
objects were made from goatskin,

260
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,173
not humans,

261
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:46,681
however,

262
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,820
that many of them really
did have tattoos on them.

263
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,331
Further,

264
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:52,840
there was a whole crew of Jewish
prisoners who testified that the entire,

265
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,010
they worked at the camp.

266
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,850
It was their job to butcher human
bodies and skin and make them into these

267
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,830
trinkets upon else's request.

268
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
Even though there were tons of photographs
proving there's all of these objects

269
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,230
truly did exist.

270
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,830
There was no proof that Elsa cock
or did these objects to be made.

271
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,730
There was only the testimony of witnesses
and that was considered heresay while

272
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,331
she was in jail.

273
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:17,070
In 1947 she became pregnant after
having an affair with a fellow jam and

274
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:17,740
prisoner.

275
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,370
She gave birth to our son and was forced
to give him away after he was born.

276
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,410
In the video footage of the trial.

277
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,440
She looks indignant and angry without
showing a single ounce of remorse for hot

278
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:29,950
pot in the Holocaust.

279
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,810
The United States military governor
named General Lucius d clay believed that

280
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:38,320
there wasn't enough physical evidence to
sentence her to death and he could only

281
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,420
give her four years of hard labor instead,

282
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,040
and she served her time.

283
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,640
However,

284
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,320
West Germany was not done with her.

285
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:44,890
Yes,

286
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,240
as soon as she was out of prison,

287
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,740
she went on trial for our crimes,

288
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,240
a third and final time,

289
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,160
and she was given a life sentence.

290
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,390
There was a particular witness,

291
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,081
Dr. Morgan,

292
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,200
who testified at all
three of Elsa Cox trials.

293
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,810
He later told the New York
Times that she was a Hussy.

294
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,590
He rode horseback and sexy underwear
in front of the prisoners and the noted

295
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,490
down for punishment.

296
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,480
The numbers of those who looked at at
Sheila rounds in our garden in front of

297
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,170
prisoners,

298
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,310
simply primitive,

299
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,060
but she had nothing to do with the
lampshade business and she did not deserve

300
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,680
such a draconian punishments.

301
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,540
She was a victim of horror stories.

302
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,290
Keep in mind to that that was the person
who was supposed to be defending our

303
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,200
character Ilsa call cad for
children during her lifetime.

304
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,870
Her two daughters and one of
our sons was raised in the camp.

305
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,411
Of course,

306
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:29,890
they were far too young to
understand the situation as a child.

307
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,900
When a son odd fin grew older and learned
just how much the world hated the Cox

308
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:34,450
family.

309
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,470
He felt he couldn't escape the guilt
and shame and so he killed himself a

310
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:38,951
daughters.

311
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,150
They were able to get married,

312
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,760
change their names and try
to move on with their lives.

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,410
There's another she was
forced to give away,

314
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,610
was named Ooh column.

315
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,120
He spends his entire life being passed
around to different foster homes and

316
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,520
never got to experience
having a real family.

317
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,210
When he was 19 he was working
as an insurance salesman
and decides that he wants

318
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:58,300
you to know his parents where he
got ahold of his birth certificate.

319
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
He figured out who his mother was and
read about how tron and the newspapers

320
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,900
after building up the courage
he visited and I are in prison.

321
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,460
She was very happy to see him.

322
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,420
She rarely if ever,

323
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:08,740
received any visitors since,

324
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:09,100
uh,

325
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,370
oldest son was dead and to do
daughters at a strange themselves.

326
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,600
It also told to the,

327
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,420
to everything bad said
about it was a complete lie.

328
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,000
He knew that since she had
helped run a concentration camp,

329
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,740
she couldn't be completely innocent,

330
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,850
but he still desperately
wanted a relationship with
his mother and he loves her

331
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:25,684
unconditionally.

332
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,400
He began visiting a once a month,

333
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:27,930
uconn.

334
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,510
I've never pushed his mother to talk
very much about world war two and just

335
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:33,070
wanted to get to know her as a person.

336
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,420
After a few of these visits,

337
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:38,020
he became convinced that his mother
could not possibly have committed such

338
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:38,980
horrific crimes.

339
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,800
She tried to convince him to
get a lawyer to set her free,

340
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,000
but it could not be done.

341
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,820
It was 1967 when she was 61 years old.

342
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,990
She realized that it was our last hope
to manipulate one more person to get what

343
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,710
she wants it and she failed.

344
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,980
So she tied her bed sheets together and
a jail cell and she hung herself in 1971

345
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,531
Ooh,

346
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,090
Cola approached the New York Times.

347
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,430
Do you tell his mother's
version of her own story?

348
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,090
And also that told him that those damn
liberal American courts were the only

349
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,550
ones who did not give her a fair trial.

350
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,870
The New York Times was eager to demystify
the lies that Elsa had told you.

351
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,680
Kona,

352
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,610
as we mentioned earlier,

353
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,000
the Americans actually did dismiss
the claims because of his essay,

354
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,670
and it was the Germans
who committed to that,

355
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:19,504
to life in prison.

356
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,390
Despite all his attempts to publish
our lives and exonerate his mother,

357
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,620
no one was buying it.

358
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,011
Ooh,

359
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,040
truly was the final victim
of how manipulation.

360
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,570
So I hope you found the video.

361
