1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,220
In the collective memory
of the People Diana,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,890
Princess of Wales was
everything rolls should be.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,940
She was beautiful,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,640
composed and full of
compassion for those in need,

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,661
and when did she died?

6
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,680
In 1997.

7
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:13,290
It was a horrific tragedy
that shook the world.

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,280
She had been robbed of a future that was
looking incredibly bright and our sons

9
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:19,080
would forever be without a mother,

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,600
but the dark secrets of
Diana's life proved this.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,790
All that glitters is not gold.

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,480
Some people believe that her death was
no accidents and there was actually an

13
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:32,481
elaborate conspiracy designed by the
royal family to silence in the biographics

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,000
video today we look at
Diana Princess of Wales.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,120
Dan was born on July the first 19,

16
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,230
61 to John and Francis Spencer.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,400
It had been a tradition for members of
the inability to marry one another for

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,470
centuries and her parents
were no exception.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,050
Together with her two older
sisters and two brothers,

20
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:02,250
they lived in a mansion called
Park House in north England.

21
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,150
As you can imagine,

22
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,580
Diana grew up with the best things that
money could buy and she went on play

23
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:08,620
dates with children in the royal family,

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,480
but all of the money in the world
can't buy happiness drawn in Francis.

25
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:15,540
They had a toxic marriage mold her life.

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,690
His parents never said,

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,390
I love you to one another
or indeed to their children.

28
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,670
They pushed off most
of the parental duties.

29
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:24,430
Do Nannies or governesses at age nine,

30
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:26,260
her father sent her to boarding school.

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,200
Her mother remarried to a
man called Peter Shand kid,

32
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:31,480
who was the ad who is
successful wallpaper company.

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,240
Her father married a woman
named rain mccorquodale,

34
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,340
who was the daughter of a
famous romance novelist.

35
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,330
The children,

36
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,760
they weren't present at their second fall,

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,341
this marriage,

38
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,620
and they have to find out
about it through the newspaper.

39
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,660
Diana to siblings deeply resented rain
as an evil stepmother and blames half a,

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,250
tearing the family apart.

41
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,040
Diana was a shy girl and
she struggled in school.

42
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:55,030
She was labeled as the thick one by her
family and this was enough for her to

43
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,230
ends up crying in school.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,880
Every time she got a bad grade,

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,680
deep down,

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,950
all she really wanted was to be loved
and accepted for who she was and dreamed

47
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:06,820
of a prince who was going to take her
away so she could live happily ever after.

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,880
When she was just 16 years old,

49
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,000
Diana met Charles the Prince
of Wales for the first time.

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,150
He was 29 and dating
her older sister Sarah.

51
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,000
The relationship between
Sarah and Charles,

52
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,880
it never went anywhere,

53
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,590
so they went their separate ways.

54
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,000
However,

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,640
Charles said that Diana
made a big impression on him
because he thought she was

56
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,640
very cheerful and beautiful
when she came of age.

57
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:32,901
Diane,

58
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:36,590
I could have chosen to party
like a socialite or travel
the world with a family

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,051
as well,

60
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:38,070
but when she was eating,

61
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,970
she chose the very normal life of
working as a kindergarten teacher.

62
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,530
She used her paychecks to Sharon
apartment with a few friends that I loved

63
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,700
taking care of children,

64
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,330
and it made her very happy to give them
the love and the encouragement that she

65
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,400
never got as a little girl at that time,

66
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,280
Diana was filled with a lot
of hope about our future.

67
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,820
She said that she felt this deep sense
of destiny and one day she would grow up

68
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,960
to do great things.

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,570
Prince Charles had been dating
several women over the years,

70
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,291
including Camilla,

71
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,220
Rosemary Shan's.

72
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,340
Camilla was not wife material
in the eyes of the Queen,

73
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,030
so she married a multimillionaire
named Andrew Parker Bowles.

74
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,080
Charles and Camilla never actually
broken off that relationship and they

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,470
continued having a secret affair the
entire time that she was married.

76
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,290
Charles was now in his thirties and under
lots of pressure from his mouth as he

77
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,750
settled down and produce an APP,

78
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,950
he needed a wife that was a member of
the aristocracy and Diana had all of the

79
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,310
qualifications of a perfectly
acceptable bright off going on.

80
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,390
Only 13 dates.

81
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,720
Charles proposed to Diana when
she was a belly legal 18 year old,

82
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,810
even though they hardly
knew one another to nfl,

83
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,680
says the becoming the princess was
the sense of destiny that she had been

84
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,620
waiting for all along a couple
of weeks after their engagement.

85
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,330
The couple was interviewed by the press.

86
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,970
Towards the end of the reporters said
that they were very much in love.

87
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,923
Dan replied,

88
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,800
of course,

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,180
Charles Loft saying whatever in
love means watching the tape.

90
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:01,720
You can clearly see that Diana was
heartbreaking and later interviews,

91
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,350
Diana defines that instance,

92
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:06,910
is the moment she knew that marrying
him would be a huge mistake.

93
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,430
However,

94
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,830
the entire world had their eyes on
her and she knew it was her duty to go

95
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,940
through with the marriage.

96
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,570
Even to this day diner and Charles still
go down in history for having one of

97
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,040
the most expensive weddings.

98
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,150
Experts estimate that today that
wedding would cost anywhere from 70 to

99
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:23,560
$100,000,000.

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,200
From the perspective of the
people watching the wedding on tv,

101
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,020
it seems like a dream come true.

102
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,400
Diana later said it was the West staff.

103
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,234
My life.

104
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,210
The honeymoon was on the
royalty entrepeur Tanya,

105
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,660
Diane,

106
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,200
and reportedly spent most of
the time sleeping in 1982.

107
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,140
Charles and Diana had been married for
less than a year and she had already

108
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:44,230
discovered Charles is secret
relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.

109
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,050
He started to gaslight her
saying that she was paranoid.

110
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,250
This made half so devastated that
she threatened to kill herself.

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,530
Joel is ignored her and started to
leave to go on a horseback trip.

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,390
Diana threw herself down the stairs.

113
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,960
The Queen rushed our aid screaming for
a doctor while will love the attendance

114
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,040
around at the princess.

115
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,220
Joel's just kept on walking
to the outside world.

116
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,670
The marriage between Diana and Charles
seemed like a fairytale that comes to

117
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,960
life for the first time.

118
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:11,350
People around the world were fascinated
and invested in the royal couple.

119
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,010
The Massa,

120
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,990
what was going on behind closed doors.

121
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,280
She had to smile,

122
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,070
wave and just pretend
that everything was fine.

123
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,100
Diana was still just a teenager when she
was put under pressure by the media to

124
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:32,550
be this perfect princess
combined with a healthy marriage.

125
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,030
It was enough to make a spiral into
a deep depression and she became.

126
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,760
She had so much empathy for other people.

127
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,700
That's a particularly difficult meeting,

128
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,490
visiting the pole sick and we
Beta mental health a lot worse.

129
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,380
Instead of recognizing
that she needed help,

130
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:50,250
Diana was treated like a child throwing
a Tantrum and the royal family just

131
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,440
continued to ignore her issues.

132
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,750
William was born when
Diana was 20 years old,

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,640
just barely out to that teenage years.

134
00:05:56,641 --> 00:06:01,580
She was to raise the future king that's
a William Reuter loss of joy and purpose

135
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,050
to our life during interviews.

136
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,350
That press would mostly ignore
how while they spoke with Charles,

137
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,660
asked Diana how the baby was doing,

138
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,110
even though this was actually
very demeaning to Diana's face,

139
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,770
would light up and she would gush about
how much fun she was having with him.

140
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,990
Even officer giving birth to the.

141
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:21,650
Our relationship with our husbands
remains coles and distance.

142
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,310
She eventually decided that if she
was going to be stuck in an unfaithful

143
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:25,970
marriage,

144
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,230
she would have an effect too.

145
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,340
When she was 23,

146
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:31,170
Donna fell in love with a cavalry
officer named James Hewitt.

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,330
They went together about a year before
how second some Harry was born in

148
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,280
pictures showing the two
of them side by side.

149
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:42,140
It is easy why people believe that James
Hewitt might actually be Prince Harry's

150
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,220
biological father.

151
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,460
This is such a popular theory that it was
even turned into a stage play that was

152
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:48,100
performed on the west end.

153
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,800
Diana pushed Charles to be more involved
in raising the boys instead of relying

154
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,820
totally on Nannies.

155
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,500
When the boys were old enough to go out,

156
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,770
she made sure they had normal
experiences like waterparks,

157
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,341
Mcdonald's,

158
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,174
and shopping.

159
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,240
She also brought them to homeless
shelters to pass out hot tea and food.

160
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,253
Prince Charles,

161
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,400
he scoffed at these ideas and asking why
all of that was necessary when she was

162
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,060
25.

163
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,620
Diana fell in love with her bodyguards.

164
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,520
Barry Maliki.

165
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,610
They became best friends and
she felt very safe around him.

166
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,650
April's lots of joy to our life,

167
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,590
but Diana claims that they
never actually crossed the line.

168
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,101
However,

169
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,790
most people still consider this to be an
emotional affair or at the very least,

170
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,530
once their friendship was revealed.

171
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,030
Prince Charles Five Medicaid,

172
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,991
no long enough to anything.

173
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:30,530
His job at the royal palace
sparing anarchy was killed
in a motorcycle accident.

174
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,580
Charles and Diana were on their way to
the con film festival in France when he

175
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,450
told her the news.

176
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,820
Charles mentioned many death so casually.

177
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,070
It was as if he was
talking about the weather.

178
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,540
Diana wanted to cry there.

179
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,630
She knew that within a few moments you
would have to step out of the car and to

180
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,460
be photographed by hundreds of people,

181
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,450
so she had to put on that smile once
again and just pretend like nothing was

182
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,100
wrong.

183
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,933
She and I just said,

184
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,300
I think he was bumped off,

185
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,433
but we'll never know.

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
Diana felt that if she did
not escape the marriage,

187
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,120
she really might want
to take her own life.

188
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,780
She knew that her only hope of getting
a divorce would be to get the public on

189
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:03,614
her side.

190
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,730
It was at this point that she decided
to speak with a journalist named Andrew

191
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,570
Morton about the truth of the
dysfunctional household motion.

192
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,100
Eventually published her
biography called a Diana.

193
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,320
Her true story in her own words,

194
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,400
for the first time in history,

195
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:19,610
the public got a glimpse into
the life of a royal marriage,

196
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,710
says certainly wasn't prissy.

197
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,510
Charles responded by being interviewed
for a documentary in 1994 called trials

198
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:27,321
the private man,

199
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:30,320
the public role where he admitted
he had an affair with Camilla,

200
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,154
Parker Bowles.

201
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,120
Lana responded by doing an
interview on BBC Panorama in 1995.

202
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,260
During this interview,

203
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:40,400
she said that she believed Charles was
not a good person and he wasn't even fit

204
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,560
to become the next king
of the United Kingdom.

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,150
She believed that her son,

206
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,990
William would do a much better job serving
the people Diana said of herself that

207
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,900
she wouldn't go quietly
saying that's the problem.

208
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,220
I'll fight to the end.

209
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,890
Diana and Charles were separated for
years and seeing other people off to the

210
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,660
bickering back and forth in the media.

211
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:08,590
The Queen herself demanded that they
needed to officially get divorced.

212
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,670
In 1995,

213
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:13,650
Diana began dating and
Egyptian millionaire named
dirty Fiat is falling though

214
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,600
was the owner of these successful
Harrods department store runs,

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,090
has the net worth of one
point $6,000,000,000,

216
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,280
which by the way is far
richer than the queen.

217
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,760
Charles and Diana were
officially divorced in 1996.

218
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,790
Jobs would eventually go on to marry
his longtime girlfriend is going to the

219
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,980
pocket bowls even after leaving.

220
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:34,981
Her position is Princess of Wales at
wanted to continue her destiny by making a

221
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,070
difference to the world.

222
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,080
She was pretty terrible
at public speaking,

223
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:41,530
which really was necessary during
charity events and public appearances,

224
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,160
so she started to receive vocal
lessons from a former actor named Peter

225
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:48,910
settlement during the lesson settled and
set up a camera to record her progress

226
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,280
and you asked her questions
about her personal life.

227
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,310
These became much needed
therapy sessions for her.

228
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,430
She revealed secrets about her marriage
and the royal family through these

229
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,720
lessons with sas alone,

230
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:02,740
and she was able to find her own voice
and learn to thrive as a public speaker

231
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,730
after her death.

232
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,210
These tapes were confiscated by the royal
family and the public were not able to

233
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:08,800
see them until years later.

234
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,701
Diana,

235
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:13,250
she became a traditional celebrity
without the benefit of royal security.

236
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:16,810
The you continued to follow her and
write about her in the tabloids.

237
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,410
Instead of allowing the press do you
only write about her hair and fashion

238
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:20,861
choices,

239
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:24,820
she decided to make the best of being
in the spotlight by getting involved in

240
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:28,520
causes that matter tat she
raised awareness about the
aids epidemic and travel

241
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:32,650
to several African countries to fight
for the ends of landmines and public

242
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:33,370
spaces.

243
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,270
One of the most famous photographs of her
was with a young amputee who had had a

244
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,020
leg blown off almost immediately after
getting the attention of the press,

245
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:41,630
the laws,

246
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:41,870
amount,

247
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,670
landmines.

248
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,503
They were changed.

249
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,051
However,

250
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,180
this was making lots
of politicians unhappy.

251
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,420
They said that she was getting involved
in issues that she didn't fully

252
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:54,160
understand how response was that she
really didn't care she was going to fight

253
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:59,010
for the people and not the politicians
instead of wilting into quite obscure.

254
00:10:59,011 --> 00:10:59,200
He,

255
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,950
Diana,

256
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,783
she was thriving.

257
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,310
She was no longer depressed.

258
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,790
She was glad to trade her
title for a life of freedom.

259
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,600
She auctioned off all of our designer
gowns and gave millions to charities that

260
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,040
she cared about all of this,

261
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,210
and you made the public love her more and
she was still a princess in the hearts

262
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,044
of the people.

263
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,730
Often her divorce was finalized.

264
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,430
Diana was dating an Egyptian
man named doody fired.

265
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,660
He was a multimillionaire.

266
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,550
He lived a very glamorous life,

267
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,190
pepper add,

268
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,120
see took photos of them on
vacations around the world,

269
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,120
the British press schools in a playboy
and write negative connotations about the

270
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,380
fact that he was Muslim.

271
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,250
He was actually a successful movie
producer who was best known for the Oscar

272
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,410
winning movie starring Robin Williams.

273
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,830
It was also the RTD multibillion
dollar Harrods department store.

274
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,520
Fortunate.

275
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,180
The two of them were very much in love
and they plans on Sunday getting married.

276
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,870
Some even believe that Diana may
have been pregnant with his child.

277
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
If this was true,

278
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,530
it would have cost a lot of
issues for the royal family.

279
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,100
The idea that William and Harry,

280
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:02,770
you could have a Muslim half sibling.

281
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,090
It was unacceptable.

282
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,050
She was also threatening to reveal more
and more secrets about the royal family

283
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,050
to the press or charity work as well.

284
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,990
It often interfered with money making
schemes among the inability indeed she

285
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:16,360
even received death
threats on a regular basis.

286
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,770
Not long before her death.

287
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,030
Diana wrote a letter to a Butler saying
that she believed her ex husband Charles

288
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,370
was trying to have are
killed in a car accident.

289
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,870
She also cold duties.

290
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,810
Father Mohammed all fire
engines told him the same thing.

291
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,960
On August the 31st 1997 dirty Fiat and
Diana were being driven through Paris on

292
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:35,750
that named Henri poll,

293
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,570
just as they entered the alma tunnel.

294
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,970
They were apparently running from pepper,

295
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,110
etsy and ended up in an accident.

296
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,033
For whatever reason,

297
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
every single one of the security cameras
inside the tunnel just so happens not

298
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,260
to be working that day.

299
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:50,260
So there is no recording
showing exactly what happens.

300
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,460
According to witnesses,

301
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,140
the car went into a pole at 65 miles per
hour and no one was wearing a seatbelt.

302
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,520
On September the sixth,

303
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:57,911
19,

304
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:58,500
97.

305
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,900
The streets of London where
lines with people moaning,

306
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,050
Princess Diana's death.

307
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,740
Millions do.

308
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,080
You didn't watch the
funeral procession on TV.

309
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,980
They're all cortel to trial and found
that the crash was simply an accident.

310
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,640
However,

311
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,070
everyone present at that
trial was obligated,

312
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,590
decide with the royal
family and that findings.

313
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,690
Many people think they
were totally biased.

314
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,321
However,

315
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:18,310
in 1999,

316
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:22,240
the French government also investigated
the car crash and they came to the same

317
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,074
conclusion.

318
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,460
It was simply an accident.

319
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,450
However,

320
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,650
in 2008 and new independent investigation
found that the driver Henri Pool had

321
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:33,880
been drinking heavily that day and the
original trial had failed to mention that

322
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,570
they also concluded pepper add,

323
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,404
see vehicles.

324
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,090
In fact,

325
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,110
tailgating the calm,

326
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,070
the jury concluded that Henri Paul was
responsible for the deaths and that if he

327
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,881
was still alive,

328
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,530
he would be convicted of meme set.

329
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,160
For some,

330
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,820
this investigation was not enough
and one of those people was Dodi's.

331
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,590
Father Mohammed are fired.

332
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,770
He had spent years of his life
struggling with racism while running his

333
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,191
business,

334
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:57,340
and he was disgusted by how
the media is portraying Dodi,

335
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,360
even though he was a victim to Mohammad.

336
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,120
All five claims that he had evidence
for 175 separate conspiracy theories and

337
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:07,480
paid for a documentary called
unlawful killing to cover them all.

338
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,020
Obviously in this video we call him
go too deep into all of the conspiracy

339
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:11,501
theories,

340
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:15,310
but it was enough for the
British government to ban
the documentary from being

341
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:16,840
seen in the United Kingdom.

342
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,760
According to these conspiracy theories,

343
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,450
Henri Paul was actually sober that day
because the receipts from the hotel

344
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:26,530
showed that he only had two drinks at
dinner and had gone through a medical exam

345
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,910
by security beforehand.

346
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,780
He had actually outrun the pepper
ratzy and mysterious wide Fiat,

347
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,171
you know,

348
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,510
followed them into the tunnel
with a group of motorcycles.

349
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,080
Some believe that these were on my
six agents who were being paid by the

350
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:39,370
government to kill her.

351
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,840
After inspecting the cola,

352
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,200
they discovered that the seatbelts and
honorary pols car had been tampered with,

353
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,060
which is why no one was wearing them.

354
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,450
It also took over an hour and a half
for the ambulance to get to the hospital

355
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,860
even though they were very doctors,

356
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:55,160
believe that if Diana was wearing his
seat and into gotten medical attention

357
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:55,850
sooner,

358
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,930
she would've survived.

359
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,950
Unfortunately,

360
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:59,660
without videotape of the crash,

361
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:03,890
we may never know the whole truth of
the circumstances surrounding her death

362
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,521
today,

363
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,301
Princess Diana,

364
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:09,140
she's not truly gone because she lives
on in Prince William and Prince Harry's

365
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,460
legacy because of her.

366
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,660
They both do charitable work and they
married for love instead of finding a mate

367
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,250
inside of the royal family,

368
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,470
and we're sure that if
she could see them today,

369
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,090
she would truly be proud.

370
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,430
