1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,000
In 1951 doctors took a tissue sample
from a poor dying black woman that was

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:08,060
given to researches without setting
knowledge or have permission.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,170
The healer cells names for the patient's
first and last name acted differently

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,610
than other cells in the lab.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,320
They were heartier and they replicated
at an amazing rate. They also didn't die.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,700
Cultivation of healer launched a
revolution in biomedical research and is a

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,410
multibillion dollar industry.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,640
The cells were sold all over the world
and lead to important advances to find

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:33,410
human kinds, deadliest diseases
including polio, HIV, and cancer.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,150
No one aside from the patients, doctors
and lead researchers knew the origins.

11
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:41,900
If the healer cells, I'll say her
name or anything else about her life.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,940
Two decades passed before this mystery
woman was revealed and it was many more

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,000
years before her family had answers
to their most burning questions.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,530
Today we examined the woman behind
the notorious and immortal Hilo cells.

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,940
Henrietta lacks

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,830
on August the first 1920 and Louisa lags
pleasant, gave birth to a baby girl,

17
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:19,400
the Reta in a shack at the end of a
dead end road in Roanoke, Virginia.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,050
At some point during her life.

19
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:25,940
Laresa changed her name to Henry Assa
though no one knows why they're shy

20
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,780
overlooking the train depot was the young
girl's home until I mother tragically

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,080
died. Henrietta at this point
was any four years olds.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,100
Eliza passed from this life to the next
to cheering Charles bath with her 10th

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,770
baby, leaving our
husbands, Johnny or widow,

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,540
unable to take care of all the children.

25
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:46,070
He sent them away to live with family
125 miles southeast from Roanoke and

26
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,730
southern Virginia. The lacks
family lived in the town of clover,

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,270
just past difficult creek on
the banks of the river of death.

28
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,370
Now this might sound like a bad omen,

29
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:59,090
but it's in the 1920s it looks like a
lot of small towns in rural Virginia on

30
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:02,240
the outskirts, fields of tobacco
and old plantation houses,

31
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:05,690
dotted the rolling hills and on
main streets down the dusty roads.

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,870
The town buzzed with life. There
was a movie theater, grocery store,

33
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:12,230
post office shops, restaurants,
and a train depot. Henrietta.

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,770
We didn't recognize the town today cause
I've lost so many of us residents by

35
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:20,630
the late 1990s that it's official charter
was revoked in the last census in 2010

36
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:25,631
the population had dwindled to a mere 438
when Johnny came to town in 1924 Henry

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,980
Essa and ten nine brothers and sisters
had to be divided up amongst the

38
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,950
relatives.
No one could take all 10 children.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,110
Henrietta ended up living
with her grandfather.

40
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:39,980
Tommy lacks in a four room log
cabin calls the home house.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,560
Generations of Laksas have lived and died.

42
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:46,100
They're buried in the small family plus
Henrietta could see out of a window

43
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,360
formerly slave quarters.

44
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:51,110
The home house was a simple structure
with no electricity or indoor plumbing,

45
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,940
only gaslands and water that Henry has
a holds up from the creek below. Tommy,

46
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,120
it was already caring for another
grandchild. Nine year old day.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,850
When Henry came to live at the home house,
the children shared a room.

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,640
Men's works everyday together planting
and harvesting the tobacco and tending to

49
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,040
the animals in the garden.
After the day's work,

50
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,690
they sometimes swam in the swimming hole,

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,800
had bonfires at night and played ring
around the Rosie with their cousins once a

52
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,150
month during harvest,
grandpa,

53
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,200
me and the cousins headed to South Boston
to the second largest tobacco market

54
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,530
in the nation to sell their crop.
It was a time they all look forward to,

55
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,770
even if the market wasn't a safe place
for children, whether it's free flowing,

56
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:31,150
booze, prostitution, and
it's the occasional murder
at the home house. Henrietta,

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,630
I work every morning at four o'clock
to milk the cows and feed the pigs.

58
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,310
When she was finished
with her morning chores,

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,880
she walked two miles to the schoolhouse
for colored children pass the white

60
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,000
school where children three rocks
is her and called her names.

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,870
Jim Crow laws segregated blacks from
whites and that remained in place until

62
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:51,460
1964 in the short 31 years of her life,
it was all she knew.

63
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,090
By sixth grade, Henry has a walk
to the school house one last time,

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,080
like day and the other Lexus she dropped
out to work in the tobacco fields.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,580
Few public photos of
Henrietta lacks exist.

66
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,790
The most well known is a striking
image from a 19 seventy's rolling stone

67
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,810
article of a smiling at smartly
dressed woman in a skirt, suits,

68
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,470
jackets and open toe sandals.

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,070
I hadn't sought firmly placed on her
hips into a Walmart highs glimmer at the

70
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,240
camera. She looks self assured with a
hint of mischief spread about in her grin.

71
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,260
It's obvious even by today's standards
that Henrietta was beautiful.

72
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,910
She was the envy of other
women and desirable to all
of the men are rounds out.

73
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,030
It wasn't only her beauty that attracted
people to Henrietta have cousin QT

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,873
described errors.

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,400
Lovie dovie as kind as she was pretty
always taking care of family and friends

76
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,690
in need as a child.

77
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:50,410
Cuti had been stricken with
polio and Henrietta took
care of him when it got bad.

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,250
Everyone who knew her remembers Henrietta
and her as a Gen Xer, caregiver,

79
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,450
and a strong woman. Even when cancer
was spreading inside her body,

80
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,940
she didn't make a fuss or
draw attention to herself.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,480
Very few people knew until the
end quite how she suffered.

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,840
Henry had no shortage of men vying
for her affection. As a young woman,

83
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,280
Henry asset chose day,

84
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,940
a cousin with whom she shared a bedroom
and had spent countless hours with since

85
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,900
the age of four they had their first baby,
a boy named Lawrence out of wedlock.

86
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,060
When Henry out,
it was barely 14 years old.

87
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,930
He was born on the home house floor
like his father runs numerous cousins,

88
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,540
aunts and uncles and grandparents
before and other likes.

89
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,460
Baby Elsie was born four years later.

90
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,060
Eventually Henry Essa and day said their
vows and a private marriage ceremony.

91
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:35,320
On April the 10th 1941
she was 21 and he was 25

92
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,180
by the winter of 1941 the country was
at war and small tobacco farms including

93
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,450
Henry Asher and days, well barely
making enough to make ends meet,

94
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,140
but to the north there was
opportunity in the booming factories.

95
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,330
Demand for steel was increasing.

96
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,050
A great migration of black
families came to Turner station.

97
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:05,030
Mary Lynn's leaving
behind the southern farms.

98
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,060
That's Bethlehem Steel Sperry
points in Baltimore County.

99
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,820
A black man could make up to
80 cents an hour. At the most,

100
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,310
any of the waxes and seen in factories.
Black men took the jobs,

101
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,100
white men rejected and they were exposed
to a host of toxic chemicals including

102
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:22,220
a speced us. When the man finished
their shifts and return time,

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,060
the toxins were shared with their wives
and children through their clothes.

104
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,110
At the urging of Lexus cousin who was
doing well for himself as point Dan

105
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,400
Henrietta moved with their babies to
turn a station starting a new life.

106
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,760
Other cousins made the transition to
including Henry edge as close friends.

107
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:42,500
Saidi the city was a change for the axes,
but they adjusted and they had fun.

108
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,890
After cleaning, cooking and taking care
of the Children Henry at are in CD,

109
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:49,190
you would put on their dancing shoes
and sneak out until the wee hours.

110
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,210
The two women boogied laughed and had a
great time and when they weren't dancing,

111
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Henrietta CD and CD's, sister Margaret
Played Bingo in Henry at his living room.

112
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,990
Turn the station was new and exciting,

113
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:02,630
but Henry Assa preferred the
country whenever she could.

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,320
She rode the train back to clover to
work in the fields or Chan barter on the

115
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:10,370
home house porch. It was here. Uh,
eldest daughter Elsie was most at ease.

116
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,090
Elsie has inherited her mother's
good looks, but she was born special,

117
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,470
are unable to speak or talk.

118
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,820
She made shops and core sounds like the
birds and sometimes flailed her arms in

119
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,654
front of her face.

120
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,410
Years later it was understood that
Elsie had epilepsy and cognitive

121
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,350
developmental delays that left
her unable to communicate.

122
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,600
No one knew what was going on in a
pretty hat that's home in Turner station.

123
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,550
Lc was known to occasionally run
out into the streets screaming.

124
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,070
By the time Henry [inaudible],
who was pregnant with her fifth baby,

125
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,940
Elsie had grown stronger and this made
it near impossible for her mother to take

126
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:42,590
care of fat to make life easier.

127
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,490
Doctors recommended Henrietta commit
LC to the Crownsville state hospital,

128
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,600
formerly the hospital for the Negro
insane, believing the doctors knew best.

129
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,540
Henry as an institutionalized,
how daughter years later,

130
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,330
a family member said apart
of Henry as a dye of the day,

131
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,740
she left LC at Crownsville.

132
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,730
Henry asset routinely visited her daughter
once a week at the hospital before

133
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,710
she became ill.
After Henry as a died,

134
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,080
no one ever went to
Crownsville to CLC again.

135
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,750
Henry. I said with certain there
was something wrong with her.

136
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,560
A year and a half before a
official cervical cancer diagnosis,

137
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,640
she shared her worry with her cousins
CD and Margaret saying there was a knot

138
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:30,840
inside and explaining how it hurts
something awful when that man wants to get

139
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,060
with me.
Sweet Jesus aren't them,

140
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,080
but some pains who were then poked to her
stomach over and over and felt nothing.

141
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,000
Maybe it was a baby growing inside.

142
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,880
They suggest it to be sure that
nothing was seriously wrong.

143
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:45,460
How cousins tried to convince Henrietta
to see a doctor, but she didn't.

144
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,150
And about a week later, Henry out,
so found out she was pregnant.

145
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,750
The ladies reassured her that it was
just the maybe making it feel funny,

146
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,480
but Henrietta wasn't convinced.
Nevertheless,

147
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:57,660
she didn't us out with Sadie and
Margaret's again and it's the women never

148
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,790
mentioned the conversation
with anyone else.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,700
Henry as a carries her fifth baby
determined after Joe was born,

150
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,580
she wasn't feeling any better.
One a alone in the bathroom.

151
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,190
She slipped into the bathtub
and reached inside herself.

152
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,750
She could feel the not until
day she needed to go and
see a doctor on a referral

153
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,070
from the local physician,
Henry,

154
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,210
as he went to Johns Hopkins Hospital
to see cancers. At this point,

155
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,941
a Henry as a fault.

156
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:22,941
The doctors would simply fix her right
up on January the 29th 1951 day drove

157
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,180
Henrietta with the three small children
20 miles from town of station to Johns

158
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,430
Hopkins.
Johns Hopkins was not any the hospital.

159
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,380
It was a renowned medical research center.

160
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,800
It also had a public water serving
patients who were too poor to afford

161
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,490
treatments,

162
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,780
many of whom were black in the 1950s and
to discriminatory segregation laws in

163
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:42,840
the United States. Black patients
could be turned away at hospitals,

164
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,900
doctors' offices and clinics
that soft white patients.

165
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,810
Sometimes the consequences are dire,
including death.

166
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,400
Johns Hopkins was Henry at his best
and only real option for diagnosis and

167
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,780
treatment of cervical cancer while day
sat in the car with their small children

168
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:01,230
waiting for Henry. After to
return, she met Dr. Howard Jones,

169
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,900
the gynecologist on duty in the exam room.

170
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,460
He reviewed her medical history
and listened to Henrietta.

171
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
Describe the lump that she felt
insider when Jones examined her,

172
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,670
he found a hard mass about
the size of a nickel.

173
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,420
The tumor was the color of
grape jello exactly in the spot.

174
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,620
Henrietta said it would be decades later
in his nineties Joan's recalled never

175
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:23,790
seeing anything like Henry his tumor
during his years practicing medicine,

176
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,970
not before and not since.
During the exam,

177
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,840
Dr. Jones caught a tiny sample of the
tumor to test and it's confirmed what he

178
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,310
suspected was cancerous.

179
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,850
Then he sent Henry as a backhoe into
town to station to await the results.

180
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,590
Jones thought it was odd
that Henry has a heard,

181
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:41,730
had a full term baby just a few months
prior with no notes mentioning the tumor

182
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,300
or any abnormalities of the
cervix listed in her chart.

183
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,850
It was unlikely physicians
would have missed seeing it,

184
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,990
which meant it must've grown at an
alarming rate. A few days later,

185
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,100
Henrietta received the results back
from the lab epidermoid carcinoma of the

186
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,690
cervix.
Stage one

187
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,560
in 1951 it was standard practice. You
conduct research on public ward hospital.

188
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:13,760
Patients without consent,

189
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,660
explicit permission or informed consent
from patients wasn't a term that was

190
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:21,890
coined and so no legal or ethical
standard existed in the United States for

191
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,270
obtaining it.
That's Hopkins,

192
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:26,690
the den leading cervical cancer experts
in the worlds and it's Dr. Jones,

193
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:30,890
his boss Richard to Lynn's believed that
since the patients were treated free of

194
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:34,730
charge, the research was a form of
payment for the hospital services.

195
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,630
When Henrietta when's in for an exam,
a sample from Henry out,

196
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:41,900
his Chuma was sent to George Gaze lab that
of tissue culture research at Hopkins.

197
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,640
Without our knowledge for years,

198
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,930
gay had been trying unsuccessfully to
grow and keep alive human cells outside of

199
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:49,400
the body in petri dishes.

200
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,650
Culturing cells allowed scientists to
test their response to all kinds of drugs,

201
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:54,191
diseases,

202
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:57,670
and conditions in order to do understand
how the human body would react.

203
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,490
The benefit of this was that it
didn't cause any harm to the patients.

204
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,820
When Henry Su went to Hopkins
and agreement was already
in place to provide gaze

205
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,380
research lab with patients,

206
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:09,370
cancerous tumor samples primarily to
be used in studies to prove to Lynn's

207
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,510
theories to lens was a believer that
of the two types of cervical cancer,

208
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,250
the noninvasive variety carcinoma in
situ could spreads and has become deadly.

209
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,190
This was contrary to what the majority
of researchers thought at the time,

210
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,040
and physicians practices
followed this conclusion,

211
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,920
treating only the invasive
cancers aggressively.

212
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,390
He actually had another motive
for his research using cells to,

213
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,990
so Lindsey wanted to reduce the number
of unjustifiable hysterectomy by

214
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,510
detecting what wasn't
cervical cancer at all.

215
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,590
The Pap smear test you use to identify
changes to a woman's cervical cells was

216
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,330
developed only a decade earlier,

217
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,260
but few physicians could interpret the
results and treat patients accordingly in

218
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:48,130
extreme cases.

219
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,460
So women who just needed a few
antibiotics declare up a minor infection.

220
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,570
Might've had a entire uterus
removed in a surgical procedure.

221
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,960
When Gaze lab assistant Mary
received Henrietta's tissue sample.

222
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,070
She had every reason to believe the cells
if they lived at all would die within

223
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:07,270
a few days. She was eating
lunch and decided to finish
a sandwich first. So far,

224
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,890
even with gay standards,
meticulous process and emphasis
on sterilization is lap.

225
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,380
Had little success with
growing human cells.

226
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,780
When Mary got to work on
Henry at has cancer cells,

227
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,110
she carefully and precisely sliced
the samples with steady hands,

228
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,130
makes the media the cells would need
to grow and labeled them healer for the

229
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:28,360
first two letters of Henrietta's first
and last names. Then she left them alone,

230
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,170
not really expecting very much. By
the next morning to marry, surprise,

231
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,610
Henrietta cells had divided and
in the days ahead he looked,

232
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,480
kept making copies of themselves.

233
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,460
They grew unlike any cells before and
expanded into as much space as Mary would

234
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,000
give them.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,230
Gay was ecstatic because the cells were
growing like crabgrass and soon among

236
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:50,560
researchers. Word was out
about the amazing healer cells.

237
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,090
Everyone knew the implications
for furthering biomedical
research and this was

238
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,690
gays goal. See, when he
began sending he the cells,

239
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,630
do any scientist interested in
using them for that own studies?

240
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,840
Henry has his treatment for
cervical cancer was radium
or radioactive metal that

241
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:19,230
glows blue in this highly toxic
in the early 20th century.

242
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:23,850
Upon radiums discovery, it was hailed as
a miracle to cure all kinds of elements.

243
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,830
Now,
Radian does kill cancer cells,

244
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,580
but it can burn skin from a person's
body if it's given in high enough

245
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:33,960
quantities being radioactive radium.
It also causes cancer.

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,500
In 1951 the radium treatment for cervical
cancer involved placing tubes inside

247
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,750
the patient's next to the affected area.
Common side effects include nausea,

248
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:46,830
vomiting, weakness, and anemia. If
Henry has experienced any of these,

249
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,730
she didn't let on or seem sick. A tall
after treatment started. Henrietta,

250
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,530
finally the same cousins. She confided
in about the knots inside out.

251
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,270
She didn't want anyone to worry,

252
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,080
but the frequent visits to Johns Hopkins
would mean she would be away and it's

253
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,280
people would certainly wonder.

254
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,700
Initially the radium treatments
seemed to work and doctors recorded.

255
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,710
The tumor is having vanished.
As therapy progressed, Henry,

256
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,920
it didn't feel any
better and to her horror,

257
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,220
her abdomen turned from
soft brown to black as coal.

258
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,390
One day she lifted up her shirt and showed
CD and Margaret's and said it felt as

259
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:20,120
though the blackness be
spreading more than inside.

260
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,550
The radium treatments didn't
cure Henrietta's cancer.

261
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,440
By the fall of 1951 her body was
full of tms and a diaphragm, bladder,

262
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,760
cervix, kidneys, lungs, and it was
all causing her excruciating pain.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,470
She Land Better Johns Hopkins and
screamed out like it was the devil of pain

264
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,840
itself between the
treatments and the cancer.

265
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,100
Henrietta was weak and our kidneys when
no longer flushing out dangerous toxins

266
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,770
in their blood.
She had to receive numerous transfusions.

267
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,290
The doctors tried different
medications to ease their suffering,

268
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,520
including morphine, which didn't even
touch the pain on one desperate attempt.

269
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,780
The doctors even injected alcohol into
our spine, but nothing seemed to work.

270
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,880
All anyone could do was sit beside her
bed and pray. Henry has to to Gladys,

271
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:05,570
was it a bad side? The night she succumbed
to cancer, knowing her time had come,

272
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,020
Henrietta made her sister promised to
take care of our kids and whispered

273
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:09,854
through tears.

274
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,750
Don't you let anything bad happen to them
children when I'm gone at 12:15 AM on

275
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:19,280
October the fourth 1951 Henrietta lacks
took her last breath and died in a

276
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,114
hospital bed.

277
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,780
Nobody was sent back to clover and
it's buried in the family plots in an

278
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,610
unmarked grave next to a mother.

279
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,280
The importance of Henrietta cells cannot
be overstated through this immortalized

280
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:45,660
continuously cultured Cell Line Cancer
Research has advanced vaccines have been

281
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:46,640
developed.
Gene,

282
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,120
nothing has taken place and treatments
of various diseases have been studied and

283
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:51,780
other taken.

284
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,350
He [inaudible] have even been put into
space on missions with both Americans and

285
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:59,880
Russians were tested against an atomic
bomb and where the first human cells to

286
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:00,660
be cloned,

287
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,140
perhaps the most well known advances
using Hela cells occurred shortly after

288
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:06,780
Henry at his death in the
midst of a polio epidemic.

289
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,320
The virus was sweeping the country and
it's parents feared for the lives of

290
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,080
their children.
In late summer dubbed polio season,

291
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,660
public swimming pools were
shut down and officials warms.

292
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,960
The virus could be spread by sitting
too close to others. At movie theaters.

293
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,260
By 1950 to 60,000 children were in
fact there's thousands or paralyzed.

294
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,610
A vaccine was in developments by Jonas
Salk that he needed a way to test it in a

295
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:34,200
lab on a grand scale before injecting
children heal provided the perfect

296
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:34,920
opportunity.

297
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,730
Soon the healer project at Tuskegee
university began growing the cell line

298
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,910
employing mostly black women,
lab technicians, Tuskegee's,

299
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,630
mass production of healer would serve
as the first of its kind and just help

300
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,940
launched a multibillion dollar industry.

301
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,260
When the first commercial
culture operation began
using Tuskegee's model in an

302
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:54,630
old fritos factory in Bethesda,
Maryland.

303
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,750
While this groundbreaking biomedical
research was taking place,

304
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,680
only a handful of people could trace
the healers cell line origins back to a

305
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:06,300
poor 31 year old black women with cervical
cancer two decades would pass before

306
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,480
the name Henrietta lacks was
finally released to the public.

307
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,143
Yeah.

308
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,201
For many years,

309
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:23,680
members of the lacks family never knew
how Henry has his cells were used to

310
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:27,280
advance medical research. Indeed, when
her name was released to the public,

311
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,980
many questions where it's still
left unanswered. The children,

312
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,830
especially her daughter Deborah,
were too young to remember.

313
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,370
Her mother runs long to know what she
was like, what her favorite color was,

314
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,830
and whether or not she
breastfed her not knowing,

315
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,190
not understanding how my mother's cells
could still be living after our death

316
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,240
was terrifying and cost the family great
anxiety and pain and sons and husbands

317
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,630
day.
We're mostly angry with Johns Hopkins.

318
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,070
The doctors and George Gay Day never
gave the hospital permission to use.

319
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:59,071
His wife sells and it didn't seem right
or fair that people were making millions

320
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,180
of dollars from selling them
by members of the family,

321
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,220
couldn't even afford health insurance.

322
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,470
Hopkins has made public statements that
the hospital has never done regularly

323
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,350
profited from Hilo runs at the time.

324
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,370
No federal regulations were in place for
obtaining permission to use Henrietta

325
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:13,480
cells for research.

326
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,430
A book published in 2010 by Walter
Rebecca Skloot and to movie starring Oprah

327
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,630
Winfrey has recently brought greater
attention to the women behind the immortal

328
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,493
Hela cells,

329
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:28,270
raising ethical questions for the well
to ponder for now over 60 years after her

330
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:28,840
death,

331
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,350
Henrietta [inaudible] cells live on
and just continue to provide us with in

332
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,130
measurable value in the fight
to cure and eradicate disease.

333
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,810
For that we can be grateful.

334
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,530
And now we know a little bit more
about the woman Henrietta lacks.

335
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,070
