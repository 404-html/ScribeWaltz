1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,030
We mentioned Winston Churchill
with his signature cane,

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:06,720
drinking scotch whiskey and puffing
on a Cuban cigar in his mouth.

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,190
His downs end and his voice as
gruff and his words pointed.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,510
This is the image of
that Hollywood portrays,

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:16,110
but it is a caricature of
the flesh and blood version.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,560
So who was Winston Churchill
in Britain's darkest hour?

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,910
Churchill lead his country from the
brink of Nazi conquest by forging an

8
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,590
alliance with the US and Russia.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,170
He had many critics and made
mistakes on a grand scale,

10
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:32,820
yet above all possessed and unwavering
belief in his own power to his beloved

11
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:33,330
country,

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,190
he offered his blood toil,

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,130
tears and sweat binds
the political figure.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,993
Who's a family man,

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,310
a man of literary distinction and artist,

16
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,140
a great lover of pets and a tinkerer.

17
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,591
Yes,

18
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,311
Winston Churchill,

19
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,170
that many hobbies today on biographics,

20
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,570
we painted the complex
picture of the lion.

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,950
So Winston Churchill,

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,030
so winston,

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,630
who was born on November the 30th,

24
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:01,901
18,

25
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,690
74 into the upper echelons
of British society.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,310
His father was Lord Randolph,

27
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:07,630
Henry Spence at Churchill,

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,890
a prominent politician,

29
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:12,850
and the third son of the seventh duke
of Marlborough Churchill's mother Jennie

30
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,590
Jerome was an American
beauty and socialites,

31
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:17,740
the daughter of a wealthy New York
stockbroker and finance financier.

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,800
The glamorous couple would seem
like a match made in heaven,

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,010
but they lived mostly apart
and carried on separate lives.

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,320
They also couldn't really be
bothered with the young Winston,

35
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:27,770
the very privileged of his pedigree,

36
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:31,780
Eden's afford in the kind of love and
affection that he sought from his parents.

37
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,470
Sadly,

38
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,303
throughout his life,

39
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,760
both father and his mother
were distance and neglectful.

40
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,590
Fortunately for the young Winston,

41
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:43,300
there was one adult in his
life who provided emotional
support and acted like a

42
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,020
mother figure.

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,150
Churchill's Natty Elizabeth Everest,

44
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,230
William as Winston called her after a
failed attempt at saying women as a child

45
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,350
was hired to care for Winston
when he was one month old,

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,400
she would remain his only real friends
and confidence throughout his childhood.

47
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,630
When she passed away,

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,680
Churchill said of her,

49
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,620
she had been my dearest ends.

50
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,810
Most intimate friends during
the whole 20 years I've lived,

51
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,950
I shall never know,

52
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,150
such a friend to gain.

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,060
Winston was just seven years old when
he was sent away to some Georgia school.

54
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,550
It's got a boarding school.

55
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,210
It was not uncommon for schoolchildren
in upper class society to be sent away,

56
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,350
but his mother dropped him
off at Paddington station
alone to catch the train at

57
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:21,190
his first school.

58
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:25,750
Winston was bullied and bruised by the
headmaster who commonly birched the

59
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:26,390
students,

60
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,130
a form of corporal punishment that
involved striking the bottoms of boys that

61
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,730
misbehaved with visible scars on Winston
from the beatings and pleased from his

62
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,540
loving nanny.

63
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,510
His parents withdrew him and placed
him in the Brighton School in 18.

64
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,344
80 two.

65
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,810
Winston escapes the brutality
of his first school,

66
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,270
but not the lessons of
Brighton which he despised.

67
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,030
Winston hated the regiments
and was rebellious.

68
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:50,380
His poor academic scores and speech
impediments or less made Winston and easy

69
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,090
targets and subject to ridicule.

70
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,551
In 18,

71
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:56,860
eth winston enrolls at the Harris
school bus with a bismal entry scores he

72
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:00,820
placed at the bottom of his class that
Winston excelled in the subjects that

73
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:01,481
interest in him,

74
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,980
including English and history.

75
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,860
He also demonstrated a pro
athlete for the sport of fencing,

76
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,170
winning the public schools
fencing championship.

77
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,890
Yet the few bright spots were
overshadowed by deepest sadness.

78
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,150
Winston recalled in retrospect those
years for not only the least agreeable,

79
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,390
but also the only baron and
unhappy part of my life.

80
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,990
Winston Churchill nearly died from the
self imposed active provider at the age

81
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,790
of 18 when he jumped off a bridge,

82
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,850
he would later India,

83
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,520
three days of unconsciousness,

84
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,570
a ruptured kidney,

85
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,090
and three months in bet it happens.

86
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,600
When the teenager was playing chase with
his 12 year old brother Jack and his 14

87
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,180
year old cousin while
vacationing at that answer state.

88
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,730
According to Churchill
and his 1930 memoir,

89
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,840
he was trapped on a rustic bridge with
brother at one ends and cousin and the

90
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:44,380
other.

91
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,790
Rather than be captured,

92
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,270
Churchill leaped from the bridge
aiming for a pine tree to slide down.

93
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,830
You greatly misjudged the distance and
fell the full height onto hard grounds.

94
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,020
Churchill was extremely lucky to survive,

95
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,360
but it wouldn't be his
last brush with death.

96
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,260
Indeed during his life,

97
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:02,680
Churchill was prone to accidents including
crashing a plane while learning to

98
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:03,251
fly it,

99
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,540
nearly drowning in a lake,

100
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,950
falling several times from horses and
getting hit by a car while trying to cross

101
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,420
New York's Fifth Avenue

102
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,190
due to his poor grades as heroism pitch.

103
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,770
Churchill's only chance at a
career was through the army.

104
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,820
It took Churchill three attempts to pass
the exam for the royal military college

105
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:23,654
at Sandhurst.

106
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,740
Churchill described taking the portion
of the exam and leaving it completely

107
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:31,550
blank except for his name and
number of blot and several smudges.

108
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,770
His father had wanted him
to be in the infantry,

109
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,900
but his scores were not
good enough for the cavalry.

110
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,420
The new training at
Santa excited Churchill,

111
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,800
and over the next 18 months,

112
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:40,790
churchill thrived.

113
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,630
He recalled I was no longer
handicapped by past neglect of Latin,

114
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,890
French or mathematics.

115
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,270
We now have to learn fresh things
and we all started equal tactics,

116
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:51,051
fortification,

117
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:51,770
typography,

118
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,110
military law and military
fortification forms.

119
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:57,560
The entire curriculum in addition
were drill gymnastics and writing.

120
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,960
Churchill finished 20th out of 130,

121
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,280
and his graduating class,

122
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,700
Judge Hill craved action and
show no fear on the battlefronts.

123
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,730
Churchill knew that he was destined for
great things and he had to prove it to

124
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:08,420
the world,

125
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,180
and war provided the perfect
opportunity to do so.

126
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,680
Churchill served in the British army.

127
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,140
There are only for a short
time from 1895 to 18,

128
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,890
99,

129
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,640
and during the same time wrote a military
reports for newspapers as well as two

130
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:20,210
books.

131
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,750
The story of the malecon field
force and the river war in 18,

132
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:24,171
99.

133
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:27,320
Churchill stepped into politics trying
to win the election to the House of

134
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,321
Commons,

135
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,210
but he failed without hesitation.

136
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:33,140
He traveled to South Africa to cover
Britain's war with the boss and say London

137
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,800
postwar correspondence at the age of 25.

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,070
Churchill arrived in Cape Town with 18
bottles of Scotch and the guarantee of

139
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:43,880
$150,000 in today's money
for a four month assignments.

140
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,600
One day,

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,070
Churchill admitted to his brother.

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,240
There is no ambition.

143
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:51,740
I cherished suit kingly as to gain
a reputation for personal courage.

144
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,100
He would say to get the chance to earn
that reputation in South Africa while

145
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:58,280
covering the watch that show it was
a board of train soldiers sent on a

146
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,210
reconnaissance mission.

147
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,290
The train was suddenly ambushed by the
enemy and Churchill immediately sprung

148
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,690
into action under fire.

149
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,150
He acted like a decorated general and
ordered the soldiers with him to flee to

150
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:08,840
safety.

151
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,710
Most of them did,

152
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,930
but Churchill was captured as a prisoner
of war and sent to Pretoria Churchill's

153
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,230
conditions in captivity.

154
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,220
They could have been worse.

155
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,470
The bose allow prisoners
to buy cigarettes,

156
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:22,220
beer and newspapers that churchill
hated every moment of it,

157
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,060
feeding the opportunity for glory so that
slipping in by one night with no real

158
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,180
plan of how to make it out of
300 miles of enemy territory.

159
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,980
He made a daring escape.

160
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,480
A massive manhunt ensued and the fugitive
Churchill was wanted dead or alive.

161
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,320
He avoided capture traveling at night
and drinking water from streams and when

162
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,430
he could go no further,

163
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,000
he took a chance by knocking on a
stranger's door on the other side.

164
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,110
He knew not whether that'd be friend or
foe saved too by pure chance or fate.

165
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,610
It was an Englishman who wants it.

166
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,950
I felt like a drowning man
pulled out of the water chapter,

167
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,970
would recall the Englishman
was John Howard Cole,

168
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,870
mine manager who had just hill in a pitch
black mine before he could be smuggled

169
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,600
to safety during this
time in the mine wraps,

170
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,660
which actually say any
company in Brisbane,

171
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,480
the story of an English lord son Escaping
prison camp and humiliating the bose

172
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,950
was a boost to the nation.

173
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,310
He became a hero and to
celebrity pretty much over night

174
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,850
with a hero's welcome and new,

175
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:19,681
found his popularity.

176
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:22,380
Churchill ran for office
and this time in 1900,

177
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:25,110
he was elected as a member of
parliaments in the House of Commons.

178
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,260
This was the start of a 55 year long
political career with the highest of the

179
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:33,060
highest and the lowest of the lows.

180
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Churchill once said,

181
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,430
politics is almost as exciting as
war and quite as dangerous in war.

182
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,690
You can only be killed once,

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,860
but in politics,

184
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,910
many times,

185
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,180
Georgia was a conservative when he
first stepped into the House of Commons,

186
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:48,450
but he repeatedly clashed with
his party on a number of issues.

187
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,520
Free trade was crucial in his mind,

188
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:51,540
and in 1904,

189
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,110
it was his party supporting terrorists
that made church or cross the floor to

190
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,460
the opposing liberal site.

191
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,710
It infuriated his fellow conservatives,

192
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,180
but it proved to be great timing.

193
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,470
The liberals to control soon after as a
newfound liberal church concerns himself

194
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:08,280
with social reforms and laid the
groundwork for the postwar welfare state

195
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,810
general again rapids.

196
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,060
We'll switch sides back
to the Conservative Party.

197
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,110
In 1925,

198
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,040
the flippant politician was
highly criticized for the
moves and he was seen as

199
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,960
an untrustworthy opportunist.

200
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,000
Churchill's greatest political failure,

201
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,070
though the one that
nearly ruined his career,

202
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,750
came in 1915.

203
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,620
World War One was at a stalemate along
the western France with allied troops

204
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,570
engaged in deadly trench warfare,

205
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,690
anxious to ended Britain's war cabinet,

206
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,890
has authorized a bold military attack.

207
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,570
The mastermind of the 40 year old first
lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill.

208
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,290
The campaign would send troops
over 1000 miles to the east,

209
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,090
establishing a second front to eventually
sees Constantinople and take control

210
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:50,310
of the sea route from Europe to Russia.

211
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,760
The plan involved a naval attacks through
the Dardanelles Straits and then a

212
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:57,120
land invasion on the gallopinto
peninsula in modern day Turkey,

213
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,810
lack of intelligence and competence
and hesitation by military commanders

214
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,430
created the perfect storm and
the campaign went horribly wrong.

215
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,670
Half of the ships were lost and a blood
bath on the shores lasted nine months in

216
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:15,981
all 45,000 allied troops in 65,000
Turkish troops lost their lives right or

217
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:21,000
wrong church or bore the brunt of this
failure and it forced his resignation

218
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:21,900
from politics.

219
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,793
For Awhile.

220
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,370
Churchill,

221
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,650
he used this opportunity to
return to the waterfront,

222
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,160
to gallop and the campaign
haunted Churchill for decades.

223
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,701
Remember,

224
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:33,570
the Dardanelles was a favorite tunes
from political opponents throughout his

225
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,350
career.

226
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,040
A second controversy would play a
churchill for a decade and send them into

227
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:38,970
political exile.

228
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,100
A period known as the wilderness years.

229
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,240
In 1929,

230
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,760
a debate erupted over
self governance in India,

231
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,830
which was at the time under British rule,

232
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,850
Churchill was no doubt and imperialist
and was vehemently opposed.

233
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,770
He also had no love for Gandhi.

234
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,220
You saw him as a threat to the British
empire and went so far as to say,

235
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,690
Gandy should not be released on the
account of a mere threat of fasting.

236
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,650
We should be rid of a bad man as
an enemy of the empire if he died,

237
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,500
except for the most right
wing of conservatives.

238
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
Job sure was alone in his position.

239
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,580
Much has been written
about Winston Churchill,

240
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,330
the Statesman,

241
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,460
but what was the bulldog at home?

242
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,830
Who was he to his friends and his family.

243
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,490
When Clemency Clementine Hosea met
the 29 year old Winston in 19 Oh,

244
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,330
four to dance.

245
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,740
She wasn't impressed.

246
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,240
He didn't ask her to dance,

247
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,160
just stared and never said
one word and was very gauche.

248
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,891
Four years later,

249
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:36,340
they would meet again at a dinner party
and this time a romance blossomed.

250
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,750
The couple married in 19 oh,

251
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:38,080
eight,

252
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,410
and would endure 57 years
together until the winstons death.

253
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,490
At the age of 90,

254
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,310
even though clementines politics
differed from Winston's,

255
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,390
she was fiercely supportive and made
standing by her man and number one

256
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,224
priority.

257
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,890
She quietly advised him and was the
only person who could reprimand his

258
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:54,580
behavior.

259
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,940
Clementine once said she would have
loved to have been a statesman in our own

260
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:01,660
right if she had been born with
trousers rather than petticoats.

261
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,510
Winston was overbearing
and temperamental at times,

262
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,300
but he was always transparent
in his love for his wife.

263
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,950
Proudly Boasting to Roosevelt's.

264
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,240
I tell plenty,

265
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,210
everything on occasion the
couple would find though money.

266
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:17,050
It was a constant worry for clemens in
who was born into the aristocracy that

267
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,670
wound up penniless in her youth.

268
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,410
Winston overspends enjoyed gambling
and was in and out of debt during one

269
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,730
particularly passionate dispute.

270
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,400
Clemency famously through a
plate of spinach at our husbands,

271
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,413
but it missed.

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,570
She also never really forgave him for
buying the family home and money that's

273
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,110
chartwell doing so on the sly when
she was laid up from giving birth.

274
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,850
The couple had five children,

275
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
but only forward survive into adulthood.

276
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,310
Their third child marigolds died at the
age of two and a half from septicemia,

277
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,900
which is an infection of the blood.

278
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,980
Unfortunately for her.

279
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:48,680
This is a condition of modern day
antibiotics would easily cure clementine

280
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,080
shrieked and anger like an animal
immortal pain upon her daughter's death.

281
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,860
One year later,

282
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,090
the Churchill's fourth child,

283
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,800
Mary was born Winston.

284
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,470
He was delighted to have the
nursery and use again churchill.

285
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,950
His duties as a statesmen
often took him away from home,

286
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,880
but he was devoted to his family,

287
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,790
determined to be different
from his own parents.

288
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,870
He were distance and
Coles whenever he could.

289
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,400
He doted upon his children.

290
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,000
He built a tree house at the family home
and used his skills as a brick layer to

291
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,830
construct a little summer house for Mary.

292
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,940
Over 40 years at chartwell at Churchill
proudly improve the property by using

293
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:19,900
his own hands,

294
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,770
building ponds,

295
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,491
structures,

296
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,324
and bridges.

297
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:22,920
The traps.

298
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,930
Jules had a multitude of
Pat's domestic and exotic.

299
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,290
Churchill was an animal lover and
his whole life as a teen in 18,

300
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:29,711
91,

301
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,580
he even sold his bicycle to buy a
bulldog named Dodo at the family home.

302
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,590
And both cats and dogs as well as pigs,

303
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,040
fish,

304
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,580
butterfly,

305
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:36,971
sheeps,

306
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:37,600
horses,

307
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,710
and black swans.

308
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,580
There was even a parrot called
Charlie who was rumored to Churchill,

309
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,211
talked to score,

310
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:42,601
could send.

311
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,590
It is against Hitler and the Nazis.

312
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,240
Though this hasn't been proven and is
most likely a myth when not enamored with

313
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,760
politics and taxing as
the savior of his country.

314
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,080
Churchill was writing,

315
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,620
painting,

316
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,490
playing Polo,

317
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,570
laying bricks at the family home or
vacationing with friends in Monte Carlo or

318
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,100
some other exotic locale.

319
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,800
We shall fight on the beaches.

320
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,510
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

321
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,850
We shall fight in the
fields and in the streets.

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,890
We shall fight in the hills.

323
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,940
We shall never surrender if it
wasn't for Hitler and the Nazis.

324
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,760
Churchill may never have become
Britain's prime minister,

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,530
often losing his cabinet position.

326
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,520
In 1929.

327
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:25,420
Many believed Churchill's political
career was over even though he was out of

328
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,080
politics,

329
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,180
he was not out of the public eye.

330
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,530
He continued to write books,

331
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,101
speeches,

332
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:34,620
and newspaper articles and warned of
the dangers of Hitler from his time in

333
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:34,961
Cannes.

334
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:38,200
The predictions of the growing Nazi
power and as the quest for domination was

335
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,034
coming true,

336
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,900
he later wrote in his memoirs,

337
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,350
my warnings over the last six
years had been so numerous,

338
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,310
so details,

339
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,370
and we're now so terribly vindicated
that no one could gain Samey at the wars

340
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:50,860
outbreak.

341
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,340
Then prime minister Neville Chamberlain
brought Churchill back into the fray as

342
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,170
Britain's first lord of the Admiralty,

343
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,930
the same position that he held
during the first world war.

344
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,320
Chamberlain had tried and failed
to strike a peace deal with Hitler,

345
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,210
and he showed himself to be incapable
of turning the rapid tide of fascism.

346
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,170
Chamberlain had also lost the support
of his cabinet when British troops can

347
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,600
prevent the occupation of Norway.

348
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,560
In 1948,

349
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,030
chamber then resigned and Churchill took
over as prime minister at the darkest

350
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,270
hour.

351
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,050
That same day,

352
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,180
may the 10th Hitler invaded Holland,

353
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,740
Belgium and the Netherlands.

354
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,700
Churchill was a brilliant orator,

355
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,980
thanks to his mastery of words.

356
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:27,970
He inspired his countrymen to fight and
some of his speeches during the early

357
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,600
days of the war.

358
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,710
Now,

359
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,310
some of the most powerful in the English
language victory was the only option.

360
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,720
He never even considered a feat even
when the outlook looks most grim.

361
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,380
When France fell to the Nazis
person was alone in its fight.

362
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,040
Churchill knew his islands nation
could not win the war alone.

363
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,170
He would need the United States,

364
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,940
and when Germany invaded Russia,

365
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,220
Churchill saw an opportunity
to forge an unlikely alliance.

366
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,300
Britain came to Stalin's
ends and Churchill defended
the decision during this

367
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:00,290
desperate time saying no one has been a
more consistent opponents of communism

368
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,820
for the last 25 years.

369
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,610
I will unsay no word I
have spoken about it,

370
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,170
but all of this fades away before the
spectacle which is now unfolding the past

371
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:09,891
with its crimes.

372
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:10,461
It's follies,

373
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,510
its tragedies,

374
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,553
flashes away.

375
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,880
The Russian danger is that for our danger
and the danger of the United States,

376
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,290
just as the cause of any Russian fighting
for half and house is the cause of

377
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:26,291
free men and free peoples in every quarter
of the globe to forge the big three

378
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,020
alliance church who have cultivated a
friendship with the American president,

379
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,250
Franklin d dot Roosevelt.

380
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,980
This was something that would
convince him to join the war effort.

381
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,250
He invited himself to the White House
and arrive two weeks after the bombing of

382
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,060
Pearl Harbor.

383
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,560
The prime minister stayed three weeks,

384
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:40,690
three Christmas albums.

385
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,190
Well policy as welcome in
Eleanor Roosevelt's eyes,

386
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,600
but it was absolutely
critical to solidifying their
alliance and winning over

387
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,810
the Americans the tube on do they
have a daily lunches and late nights

388
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,800
strategizing by the time you left ftl
founds that he missed his friends and send

389
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:55,970
a note to Churchill in London,

390
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,790
which reds it is fun to be
in the same decade with you,

391
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,660
with the Americans now in the war and
the Russians fighting on the side of the

392
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,170
allies.

393
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,680
Hitler's armies were pushed back and
victory was declared on May the eighth,

394
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:07,011
19,

395
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,090
45 in Europe.

396
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,530
Three months later in the East,

397
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,380
Japan surrenders marking
the end of world war two.

398
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,371
In a surprise,

399
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:14,300
that very same year,

400
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,280
Churchill did not win reelection.

401
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,390
Following the ward,

402
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,490
Churchill continue to
influence world affairs.

403
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,720
He gave his speech on the iron and about
the USSR threats and was strongly in

404
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:31,410
favor of person's independence from
the European coal and steel community,

405
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,060
which was set up after the war,

406
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:36,030
so you neutralize European
competition for natural resources.

407
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,410
Churchill actually served
as prime minister again in
1951 and resigns at the age

408
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:41,040
of 18.

409
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,410
It was at this time that he
was in deteriorating health.

410
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,810
Churchill was intense on
leaving his mark on history,

411
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:49,710
not just through clamoring for fame and
power or placing himself at the center

412
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:50,470
of the action.

413
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,820
Indeed,

414
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,810
he would write his own story and solidify
a favorable view to be passed through

415
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,780
the ages at the end of world war two,

416
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,800
Churchill wrote as best selling series,

417
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,790
Second World War,

418
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,840
and won the Nobel Prize in literature
in Nineteen 53 and that same year,

419
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,460
he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth the
second in 1965 after suffering a stroke

420
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,294
two weeks earlier.

421
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,330
Winston Churchill pass from
this life until the next.

422
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,110
It seems.

423
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,220
The whole world felt the
loss and reporters remarked
that it was the end of an

424
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:17,760
era.

425
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,420
The queen saw to it that Churchill's
funeral was the grandest of any commoner

426
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,231
since 18,

427
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,010
52,

428
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,600
which was on a scale.

429
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,340
The fitting has position in history.

430
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,640
His body lay in state in Westminster
Hall for three days and nights,

431
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,670
and it's no fewer than 320,000 people
filed past to pay their respects.

432
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,230
And as we move towards
the end of this video,

433
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,490
let me mention something interesting.

434
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,413
Ten years ago,

435
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,920
a fifth of all British teenagers.

436
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:43,830
Polls believed Churchill to
be a fictional character.

437
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,730
His legends indeed may seem larger than
life and knowing them and apart from his

438
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,910
greatest moment on the
world stage is to grasp.

439
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,060
To say he was complex and
contradictory is an understatement.

440
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,180
We know he held himself
in the highest regards,

441
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,100
but Churchill also suffered
in the depths of depression.

442
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,380
He referred to it as his black dog.

443
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,970
His stubbornness courage,

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,410
grits and his brilliance with words made
an indispensable and his legacy is one

445
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:11,490
that will live on and inspire the good
fight and no doubt Joshua will continue

446
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,690
to be judged and analyzed through the
ages for his failed decisions and on

447
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,010
popular attitudes.

448
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,980
He was a product of the
time with an impossible job.

449
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,520
Statesmen are not called upon
to settle easy questions.

450
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,740
These often settle themselves.

451
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,030
It is where the balance quivers and as
the proportions are veiled in mystery

452
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,720
that the opportunity for weld
saving decisions presents itself.

453
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,690
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.
