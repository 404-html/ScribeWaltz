1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,980
He created a body that was to become the
gold standard for muscular development.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,830
He would use it to achieve
one goal after another,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,530
rising to the very pinnacle of not one,

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,020
but three careers from the very start.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,720
Arnold Schwarzenegger had
the odds stacked against him.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,860
He was dismissed.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,790
He was ridiculed.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,900
He was parodied.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,940
All massive.

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,783
Leslie,

11
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,000
what people fail to realize was
that Arnold strongest muscle,

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,500
there wasn't as biceps.

13
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,270
It was his brain with its.

14
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:29,450
He orchestrated career moves
that took him to the very,

15
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,380
very top.

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,790
In this biographics video,

17
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:36,620
we're going to uncover the unlikely
rags to riches story of the one and only

18
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,760
Arnold Schwartzenegger.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,700
Oh,

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,770
notes Watson scenango was born in the
tiny and Austrian village of near Grand

21
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,541
Central and the 30th,

22
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,530
1947.

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,400
His father,

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Gustavo,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,960
was the local police chief arnold and
his older brother Meinhart grub under the

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,370
tough discipline of a man who was used
to being a bait on those early years.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,020
They were incredibly regimented.

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,080
It'd be up at six and then off to
get the milk from the farm next door.

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,770
Then you would have to do a set of
physical exercises that his father had

30
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:25,550
written out for him.

31
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,700
He would earn his breakfast if I'm
doing a certain number of setups.

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,400
In the afternoon after I'd
finished his homework and chores,

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,160
his father made arnold in
mine heart practice soccer.

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,080
No matter how bad the weather was,

35
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,700
if they messed up on a play,

36
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,660
they got yelled at because staff had
been a champion Ice Keller in his younger

37
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:43,040
years and he pushed his sons.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,650
Do you excel physically
with his father's pushing?

39
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:46,251
I'll load first.

40
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,500
Got into competitive
sports at the age of 10.

41
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,950
He played soccer passionately
for almost five years.

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,020
When he was 15,

43
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:53,870
I was a soccer coach.

44
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:57,690
Decided that lifting weights for an hour
once a week would be a good way for his

45
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,000
players to stay in shape.

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,390
Sorry.

47
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,640
He took them for a visit to the local gym.

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,990
This is a day if it would
absolutely change Arnold's life.

49
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,650
He was mesmerized by the sheer size of
the bodybuilders you've talked to the

50
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,190
gym,

51
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,220
waging war with steel weights
on older with leisure.

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,690
Record his feelings and his 19,

53
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,690
77 or so biography arnold,

54
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,550
the education of a bodybuilder there.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
It was before me,

56
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,180
my life,

57
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,500
the answer had been seeking.

58
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,490
It clicked.

59
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,660
It was something I suddenly just seemed
to reach out and find as if I'd been

60
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:31,661
crossing a suspended bridge and finally
stepped off onto solid grounds on old.

61
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,560
He embraced weightlifting.

62
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,830
He seemed discovered that he had an
amazing ability to build muscle and within

63
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:40,280
two years he had already overtaken most
of the other trainers at the gym and

64
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:40,830
grabbed swear.

65
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,020
He worked out religiously.

66
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,180
He also trained harder than anyone else.

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,490
One Sunday discovering
that the gym was closed,

68
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,060
he actually smashed the window in order
to get in so that he could complete his

69
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,920
work out his father,

70
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:56,000
that he was less than impressed
with his son's new found obsession.

71
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,930
Bodybuilding,

72
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,000
it was really a fringe sport in
Australia at that time with those who are

73
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,590
politic of what's being looked down upon
and considered in some way defective.

74
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,040
When it was discovered that Donald had
pictures of half naked men with bulging

75
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,690
muscles on his bedroom wall,

76
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,560
a psychiatrist was called in
to save on old from himself.

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,520
The psychologist assured his parents
that this was simply a phase and arnold

78
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,280
would absolutely grow
out of this and well,

79
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,091
as you probably know,

80
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:23,620
he absolutely didn't.

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,030
By the age of 17,

82
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,930
Arnold had already realized
that bodybuilding was
going to be his vehicle to

83
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,460
weld wide fame.

84
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,490
He spends many Saturday afternoons
down at the local movie theater,

85
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,840
watching bodybuilders turned,

86
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,270
actors such as Steve Reeves,

87
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:36,610
centers,

88
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,050
personal favorite ranch park.

89
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,060
He watched them onscreen Blang,

90
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,800
Hercules,

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,280
and other mythic heroes.

92
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,030
They had used bodybuilding in order
to create careers as movie stars,

93
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,300
and that was exactly
what Arnold wanted to do.

94
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,960
Only he was going to be bigger
and better than any of them.

95
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,130
Arnold,

96
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,180
he entered the Austrian army in 1965
in order to fulfill his one year of

97
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:08,900
service.

98
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,321
By now,

99
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:12,680
it builds his body to 200
pounds of Herculean muscle.

100
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,020
He was assigned as a
drive it in a tank units.

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
Shortly after he was inducted,

102
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,990
Arnold received an invitation to compete
in the junior division of the midst of

103
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,640
Europe contest in Stuttgart,

104
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,300
Germany,

105
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
but he was in the middle
of basic training.

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,430
No soldier was allowed to
leave the base for any reason,

107
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,840
but almost knew that his destiny
was tied with winning this contest,

108
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,040
so he decided to go,

109
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:34,221
Hey,

110
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,630
well they in order to get beat,

111
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,720
he crawled over the wall,

112
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,670
taking only the clothes he was wearing
and barely enough money to buy a third

113
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:41,810
class ticket to Germany.

114
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,010
When he arrived at the competition,

115
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:46,460
he actually had to borrow someone else's
posing trunks and they're tanning oil

116
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,150
still.

117
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,980
His muscles were undeniable.

118
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,100
Last night it was
announced junior Mr Europe.

119
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,060
At first the army,

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,510
they were not exactly impressed and he
was actually jailed for seven days with

121
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:59,960
only a blanket on a cold stone
bench and almost no food,

122
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,000
but within a few days
the news of his victory,

123
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,110
it spreads as the top brass decided that
the title added Prestige to the army.

124
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,100
When he returned to the ranks,

125
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:10,130
he was held up as a sort of
ideal with his drill instructor.

126
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:10,964
Telling the troops,

127
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,350
you have to fight for your father,

128
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:13,850
that you have to take courage.

129
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,220
Look at what Schwartz negatives.

130
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,610
Just to win this title,

131
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,200
not following his stint in the army.

132
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,500
Arnold took a job as a gym instructor
at a Health Club in Munich,

133
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,190
Germany.

134
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,220
This presented him with the ideal
opportunity to train for the 19,

135
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,230
66 Mrs Europe competition.

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,640
This was the next step and his master
plan to become the best built man on the

137
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:32,180
planet.

138
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,410
He trained twice a day,

139
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,880
working like a champ possessed in
order to forge his winning physique.

140
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,580
By the time he arrived in
stuck out for the contest,

141
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,270
people were anxious to get a
look at this monster from Munich,

142
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,860
the one that that had room is all about
all of the attention infused on old with

143
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:51,860
a great deal of confidence under
your already felt like the winner.

144
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,340
Arnold's,

145
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,640
when that day was so emphatic that the
judge has offered to pay his way to the

146
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:56,990
upcoming Mr. Universe.

147
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,970
He arrived in London,

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,620
I mean almost no English,

149
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,630
but as soon as he stepped out of his cap,

150
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,370
people began mobbing him.

151
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,810
They'd all been waiting for them,

152
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,160
the first bodybuilder in
Europe with 20 inch arms,

153
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,180
but unfortunately he didn't win that day.

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,210
The American shatter.

155
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,700
Your son had a more complete defined
physique and he forced Donald's to accept

156
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,210
second place on.

157
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,810
Ols returned to Munich and threw
himself back into his training.

158
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,520
He shut everything out of his mind
and concentrated on only one thing.

159
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,750
Winning the 19,

160
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:31,040
67 Mr. universe competition and
sure enough on September the 23rd,

161
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,431
19,

162
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,680
67 Arnold Schwarzenegger became,

163
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,120
that's 20 years of age.

164
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,790
The youngest Mr University history a
year later and even more massive on

165
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,980
returning to London to claim the
professional Mr. Universe title,

166
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,180
following that victory,

167
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,000
Donald received the phone call that would
prove to be the next great signposts

168
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,890
to his future on the other end of the
line and it was Joe Weider Bodybuilding

169
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:54,770
Guru and publisher of
Muscle Builder magazine,

170
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,240
wider invited Arnold to compete in the
IFB be Mr. Universe in Miami and then

171
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,520
come to train in
California and work for him

172
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,080
on older arrives in America in September
1968 with the gym bag at 20 US dollars.

173
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
Still virtually no English,

174
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,960
he settled into a small apartment in
Venice beach and was given a small stipend

175
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,380
money wider in exchange for the
rights to use this image in magazines.

176
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,590
Arnold's plan was to stay
in the USA for one year,

177
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,300
absorb their trading strategies,

178
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,180
and then use them to beat the
Americans at their own game.

179
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
Almost began training.

180
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,610
It's a small gym in Venice Beach,

181
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,500
Los Angeles called Gold's gym.

182
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,870
He rubbed shoulders with
all the American top.

183
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:44,440
Bodybuilders quickly established
himself as the leader of the pack.

184
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,780
In 1970 arnold,

185
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,840
he won the coveted triple crown of
bodybuilding claiming at the Mr Universe,

186
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,620
Mr. World,

187
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,021
ams,

188
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,390
the Mr Olympia titles.

189
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,410
He was now the undisputed
king of bodybuilding.

190
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,580
Arnold went onto win six consecutive
Mr Olympia titles as he completely

191
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,100
dominated the sport and with this well,

192
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,600
he was ready to implement
phase two if it's master

193
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,493
flat

194
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,340
in services,

195
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,880
Jay y dot.

196
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,180
I got a call from a film production
company looking for a bodybuilder to play

197
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,830
Hercules in a low budget film.

198
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,280
Why did he immediately thought of Arnold's
telling the producer that Arnie had

199
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,640
been a shakespearian actor,

200
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,860
that back in Europe,

201
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,720
they signed him up immediately.

202
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,130
The result was Hercules goes to New York
and it was to be Arnold first stands,

203
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,270
most forgettable film.

204
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,040
It's credits.

205
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,450
Reid,

206
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,400
Arnold strong and thick Austrian
accent was actually dubbed over.

207
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,000
Still.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,530
They got paid $10,000,

209
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,280
which he invested into California
real estate his next paycheck or is it

210
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:50,940
actually takes some time coming because
bottled found Hollywood's less receptive

211
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:51,750
than he had hoped,

212
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,840
several agents and tells him that
he had everything going against him.

213
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,800
He a long name,

214
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,110
which was difficult to pronounce,

215
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:01,650
to strain Jackson's salvador loft and
unusual builds which will never make it

216
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,090
into films for Ronald's.

217
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,570
This was the very motivation
that he needed back in Australia.

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,360
He had been told that he could
never become a champion bodybuilder,

219
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,210
and yet that is exactly what he became.

220
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,541
Now,

221
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,350
he would reinvents himself through the
same as sheer hard work and dedication

222
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,310
that he had learned in the gym in order
to become the highest paid movie star on

223
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,060
the planet.

224
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,360
He would make those agents
in their words on north.

225
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,580
He began acting lessons in 1974.

226
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,130
He won a supporting role
in the Bob Rafelson movie.

227
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,000
Stay hungry.

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,661
In this movie,

229
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,630
he played a bodybuilder named Joe Sando,

230
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:35,670
so it's hardly stretched
his acting ability still.

231
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,300
He was absolutely determined to make
an impression and make an impression.

232
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:39,870
He did.

233
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,120
He won the Golden Globe for best newcomer.

234
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,340
Then in 1977,

235
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,430
the documentary pumping on opened in
theaters the chronicle Donald's victory in

236
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:52,431
the 1975 Mr Olympia over the new for the
future incredible hulk as his charming,

237
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,870
confident self Arnold's onscreen charisma.

238
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,090
It was impossible to resist pumping
on lead just more roles in the movie.

239
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,150
It's the villain and the
Jayne Mansfield Story.

240
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,201
Bali.

241
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,100
This point in his life,

242
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,290
I know he was already a
successful businessman.

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,830
He was combining real estate investments
of best selling biography and

244
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,480
bodybuilding training courses.

245
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,330
This meant that he could afford to
wait for just the right film projects.

246
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,510
He filled his time with public
appearances and social functions.

247
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,870
One such function was the Robert F
Kennedy tennis tournament in Hyannisport.

248
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,750
There he caught the eye of a beautiful,

249
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:34,110
dark haired girl by the
name of Maria Shriver,

250
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,200
that she was the daughter of gardens and
Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the niece of

251
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,220
John Fitzgerald,

252
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,870
Kennedy Animals and Maria.

253
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,141
Well,

254
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,520
they fell in love at first sight,

255
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,420
the Shriver's.

256
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,710
They were great philanthropists and
through them monitored was introduced to

257
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:47,830
these Special Olympics,

258
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,410
which she has been passionately
involved with ever since.

259
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,420
In 1979,

260
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,100
I began a career as a
CBS sports commentator.

261
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,150
He also graduated from the University
of Wisconsin with a business degree,

262
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,200
but it was a year later.

263
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,790
He's stunned the bodybuilding world
with his comeback at the Mr Olympia

264
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,690
competition in Australia.

265
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,030
There he captured his seventh title,

266
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,260
cementing his legendary status as
the greatest bodybuilder of all time.

267
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,930
Arnold's come back though it
wasn't without controversy.

268
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,070
He went to Australia in the role of a
TV reporter only signing his name to the

269
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,630
register at the last minute.

270
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,500
He was also good friends with the head
judge bodybuilding legend build Po.

271
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,990
The general consensus
was the Donald on stage.

272
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,300
It was a mere shadow of
his former self is victory,

273
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,750
was for the first time
actually greeted by Booz still.

274
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,850
He had his seventh Mr Olympia title,

275
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,800
the great shape that Arnold said goes
into for the 1980 Mr Libya propelled him

276
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,470
to his breakthrough role
as Conan the barbarian.

277
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,630
After spending a year in working on
his speech and learning how to use our

278
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,553
broadsoft's,

279
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,590
he headed off to Yugoslavia in Spain
for a grueling six month shoot Conan the

280
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,441
barbarian.

281
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:05,830
It rakes in more than a hundred million
dollars at the box office together with

282
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,420
its sequel Conan the destroyer,

283
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,410
it firmly embedded the name Arnold
Schwartzenegger into movie go is

284
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,021
consciousness.

285
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,470
As following his success
with the Conan movies,

286
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,640
Arnold was offered a low budget movie
by first time director and screenwriter,

287
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,690
James Cameron.

288
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,990
This would prove to be his most iconic
role in the terminator on old place,

289
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,150
a sidebar except back in time to kill
the mother of the man who will save

290
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,650
humankind from destruction.

291
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,371
The role well,

292
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:31,660
it was made for Ronald's,

293
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,890
his accent and his body.

294
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,700
The very things that agents had said would
work against him were perfect for the

295
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,610
part of the thousands.

296
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,230
The terminator was an absolute smash,

297
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:44,350
firmly establishing Arnold as
the next great action stop.

298
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,460
By 1985.

299
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,060
He had already been named international
star of the year and on April the 26th,

300
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:49,391
19,

301
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,000
86,

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,740
arnold's a staunch
Republican as Maria Shriver,

303
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,670
a member of democratic royalty,

304
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,610
or they were married but their honeymoon.

305
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,310
It was barely over before arnold flew
to Mexico to film his latest action

306
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,310
blockbuster credit at this movie again,

307
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,830
one in the title action star of the
year after a string of action films come

308
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:07,570
onto a raw deal,

309
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,770
predecessor and the running man.

310
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,720
The forward thinking arnold was ready
for a new challenge and that challenge is

311
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:14,320
comedy.

312
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,153
So unsurprisingly,

313
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,760
very few are willing to take a
gamble on Arnold as a comic actor,

314
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,520
but one who was was the
director Ivan Reitman.

315
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,580
You created a special vehicle
for adults this vehicle,

316
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,840
but it was called twins.

317
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,010
The irresistible chemistry
of Schwarzenegger and
Danny Devito made twins and

318
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:30,880
immediate hit,

319
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,830
and two years later,

320
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,660
honnold again teamed up with
and for kindergarten cop,

321
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,370
another comedy success.

322
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,880
A large part of the success of these
films is Arnold's ability to laugh at

323
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:40,900
himself on always,

324
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:41,711
always got the job,

325
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:45,280
which was really endearing to fans over
and above that I know it's also a gifted

326
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:45,821
comedian.

327
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:48,100
As anyone who's seen
pumping iron will know now,

328
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:51,050
one person who noticed on those
abilities on kindergarten cop,

329
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,490
especially his rapport with
children with President George Bush,

330
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,050
Bush appointed as the chairman of the
President's Council on physical fitness.

331
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,990
Now this could have really
been a symbolic role,

332
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:01,460
but arnold,

333
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,280
he totally threw himself into it with
absolute relish visiting every state in

334
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,870
order to promote the fitness lifestyle.

335
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,321
Now,

336
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:09,340
this movie winning streak,

337
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:12,700
it totally continued for Arnold yet
total recall and terminator two,

338
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,560
this sequel cost $100,

339
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,221
million dollars,

340
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,990
making it the most expensive film at
the time it returns an astonishing 519

341
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,110
point $8,000,000 with Arnie.

342
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,550
Pocketing a cruel 15 million.

343
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:24,971
Now,

344
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:28,070
Arnold's next big movie out
seeing was the last action hero,

345
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,520
a $100,000,000 extravaganza,

346
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,320
which seemed like a short thing,

347
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,800
but felt it was a box office
bomb and critical flop.

348
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,020
Hollywood's was really
quick to tear it down,

349
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,150
claiming that his time in
the limelight was over,

350
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,440
but Schwartzenegger,

351
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,030
he had other ideas.

352
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,850
He bounced back from defeat with the
same focus determination as in as

353
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:47,740
bodybuilding days.

354
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,230
He retained with James
Cameron for the action packs.

355
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,430
James Bond Spoof true lies well.

356
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:53,820
The movie was a smash on nodes.

357
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,140
Critics were once again
silenced and he was back on top.

358
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,940
In the mid 19 nineties,

359
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,570
all began focusing on giving Max to
the country that had given him so much.

360
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,590
He became an organizer and sponsor
of the annual inner city games.

361
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,470
He was also very involved in
the afterschool care program.

362
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,860
In 2003 during an appearance
on the Jay Leno show,

363
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,400
Arnold announced his candidacy
for governor of California.

364
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,300
This was following the recall of Governor
Gray Davis sparks by the California

365
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:31,410
electricity crisis.

366
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,720
I'd he ran an energetic
campaign discipline.

367
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:38,040
It's a smear campaign organized by the
La Times and number of women claims over

368
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:38,950
the years on altered,

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,890
molested them while of claims to have
had a fence with him still on old.

370
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,680
He was able to rise above this with
his unique mix of chogm intelligence,

371
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:50,880
and on one occasion someone threw an
egg which splashes Omanis jackets.

372
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,780
He immediately went to the Jack is all,

373
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:54,570
threw it over his shoulder and called out.

374
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,170
Hey,

375
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,370
I a bacon with those eggs on he,

376
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,770
he easily won the governorship.

377
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,560
Hands immediately sat about
cleaning house at Sacramento,

378
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,000
bringing his own unique styles.

379
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,640
That position such as calling
as democratic opposition,

380
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,230
gunny men almost first time it was marked
by such early victories as repealing a

381
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:14,310
vehicle license in Greece and stopping
illegals from getting driver's licenses,

382
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,510
but then powerful state to unions began
to oppose his initiatives and for ballot

383
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:18,781
measures.

384
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:21,660
He sponsored in a
special election in 2005.

385
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,553
They were the fetus.

386
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,443
Despite this,

387
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,380
he was reelected governor in 2006 with
56 percent of the votes on a second time.

388
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,750
He put a lot of effort
into environmental issues.

389
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,860
In 2006,

390
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,200
he signs the global warming Solutions Act,

391
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,240
making California the first state to
put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions on

392
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,500
old second time as governor.

393
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,080
It came to an end in January of 2011.

394
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,130
A few months later,

395
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,120
the La Times ran a cover story repurposing
that Arnold had fathered a child 14

396
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:52,530
years previously that the family's
longterm mate as a direct result of this

397
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:56,160
revelation and Maria and
just that 25 year marriage,

398
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,640
she and therefore children moved
out to the family home in Brentwood.

399
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,770
Okay.

400
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,360
Arnold's post governorship movie career
has seen him feature in such action as

401
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,620
the expendables two and three escape plan,

402
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,460
sabotage,

403
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,020
and the fifth installment Terminator in
which he battles his younger self on lts

404
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:25,590
maintained strong ties to the bodybuilding
world following his retirement from

405
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:25,921
the sport.

406
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,820
In 1975,

407
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,980
he promoted the Mr Olympia competition.

408
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,420
Then in 1989,

409
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,040
he ends longtime partner Jim lorimer
started the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic,

410
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,960
which is now the second biggest pro
bodybuilding show just behind Mr Olympia

411
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,190
Arnold credits all of his success.

412
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:45,240
Do these self discipline drive and focus
that he learns from his body building

413
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,860
career in more recent times,

414
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,550
Donald has been involved in a social
media feud with President Donald trump in

415
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,450
the wake of ani,

416
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,460
replacing trump won celebrity apprentice.

417
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,840
Trump blames on all for the show.

418
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,770
That's dismal ratings,

419
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:59,220
and Donald offered the commander in chief
some timely advice on how to run the

420
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,380
country on old,

421
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,500
a staunch Republican,

422
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,000
refuse to vote for trump and the 2016
presidential election the first time he

423
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,510
had not supported the Republican
candidate since becoming a US citizen.

424
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,440
Although it's about all we would all love
to see unfortunately on challenge the

425
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,470
Donald for the top job as he
wasn't born in the United States,

426
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,300
even though he did become
a citizen in 1983 on.

427
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,101
Well today,

428
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,780
he still lives the fitness lifestyle.

429
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,790
He just celebrated his 70th birthday

430
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,580
kind of.

431
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,413
All

432
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,440
right,

433
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,800
let's turn it around to the back.

434
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,520
It still works out every day,

435
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,350
so I really hope you found
the video interesting.
