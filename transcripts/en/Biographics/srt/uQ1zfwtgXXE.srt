1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,770
She put herself in danger in the pursuit
of a good story. She uncovered wrongs,

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:04,880
committed in society.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,930
She traveled around the world and she
did it all in a time when women weren't

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,900
expected to do anything beyond
get married, have children,

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,510
and take care of the home. She
lives her life, very different men.

6
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:18,380
She faced backlash, but she never
backs down and she'd changed lives.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,900
Energy changed journalism forever.
Well,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,350
he wants this courageous woman that
would of course be nearly blind or women

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,370
ahead of our time.

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,443
No,

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,040
though it's the name
she's best known as today.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,110
Nellie Bly wasn't actually born as such.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,730
After birth in 1864 she was christened
Elizabeth Jane Cochran and growing up she

14
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,700
was indeed known by a different name
altogether and that would be pink.

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,970
She was a vibrant, energetic Charles.
You've never shied from attention.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,330
Her mother encouraged her vivaciousness
and allowed her to dress in bright

17
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:03,810
colors. Most of the girls and women in
her home town of Cochrane in Pennsylvania,

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,370
we're wearing drab colors of brown,
black, gray, and white, but it's pink.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,700
Stood out. She had to, she
had 13 brothers and sisters.

20
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:14,130
To contend with for attention after all.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,760
The town was actually named after
blaze Father Judge Michael Cochran.

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,570
Judge Cochran unfortunately passed away
at an early age and Bly was only six

23
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:25,020
years old when it happens. Per father
did not have a will and his death left.

24
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,540
The family impoverished.
Blaze mother remarried,

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,640
but it's the marriage turned out to
be a disaster and new husband's blind.

26
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,380
Step father was a violent drunk when
blinds mother had finally had enough of

27
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:38,250
this mistreatment. She filed for
divorce that's only 14 years old,

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,860
but I was called upon to
testify at the divorce trial.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,820
She had to speak up about what she had
seen this violent man do and how he had

30
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,070
mistreated her mother,
true to her personality.

31
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:51,150
Even then she was honest and witty even
in what must have been an incredibly

32
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:55,140
difficult situation for a young teenager.
During the trial, she told the court,

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,670
my stepfather has been generally drunk
since he married my mother and when drunk

34
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,420
he is very cross,
he is cross save it to the whole law deal.

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,510
Made an impression on Bly in the year
where she was living in marriage was

36
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,400
supposed to be the
ultimate goal for a woman.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,900
Having seen how mother's experiences blind
knew that marriage didn't always need

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,250
a secure future or even happiness blinds.

39
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:20,040
She decided that she was going to make
her mark on the world all by herself.

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,190
Initially went to school for a
career in teaching for a woman.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,160
That was one of the only career
path is available at the time.

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,040
She was a good writer,
but she wasn't a good student.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,630
Then after only one semester,

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,810
she couldn't afford the tuition and
so her mother needed help at home,

45
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,400
so she had to leave school.

46
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,790
She moved with her mother and siblings
to Pittsburgh where they ran a boarding

47
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,570
house for income.

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,660
Once a blight picks up a local
newspaper and was a gas at column,

49
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,830
she rat the title.

50
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:57,010
It was enough to set her off because
it was what girls are good for.

51
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,570
The actual contents.
Well,

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,650
those what outright angering the column
asserted that women were good for

53
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,071
nothing.

54
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,060
That's staying at home and giving birth
and when it came to working women, well,

55
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,870
the radical them,
a monstrosity blind.

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,390
She wasn't one to sit idly by and let
something she disagreed with as much as

57
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:18,190
this PA spine. She drafted up a response
using the pseudonym, lonely often girl.

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,190
Her response caught the attention
of the papers editor George Madden,

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,320
but Ashley had risen.
It's under a pseudonym.

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,320
He had no way to identify
and get in touch with blind.

61
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,690
He was so impressed though
that he didn't give up.

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,740
He was an advertisement and the Pittsburgh
dispatch asking Lingley often go to

63
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,910
contacts and the paper and to reveal her
identity and well, why did he do this?

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,300
When he wants to give her a job by
responding to the advertisements and was

65
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:43,060
given the chance to write
a column on a trial basis,

66
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,580
after I call them was published
in the Pittsburgh dispatch,

67
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,070
not an highlighter for a full time job.

68
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,880
While at the dispatch Cochran officially
adopted the name that the world would

69
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,850
come to remember.
Of course that would be Nellie Bly.

70
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,410
She worked for only $5 a week,

71
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:00,040
but she had a platform to share her
ideas about women's independence.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,340
Lie also began the work that would
make her famous outing social wrongs.

73
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,570
As an undercover reporter.

74
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,420
She combines the two messages by going
undercover as a factory worker and

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,251
writing an expo,

76
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:13,180
say on the poor conditions that women
faced as they tried to and pennies to help

77
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,170
feed the families.

78
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,050
Jolson writes about the unfair
treatments of women who were in divorce

79
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:18,140
proceedings.
That topic,

80
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,130
she knew a thing or two about us
because of her mother's experience.

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,330
Bonton and articles were controversial
and advertisers don't like controversy.

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,193
Sound familiar?

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,180
They started to pull their ads from the
dispatch and the publisher got nervous

84
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,530
if she was going to cause
problems for their bottom line.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,080
They didn't see the value
in keeping Bly in this role.

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,090
That was so atypical
for a woman at the time,

87
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,330
so they put a women writers usually works
the fashion and society pages blind,

88
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,090
wasn't really happy with this
move in 1887 is only 23 years old.

89
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,250
She moved by herself to New York City.
She didn't have a job,

90
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:52,630
but when she went to the big city, in
fact, she was unemployed for months.

91
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,170
She wasn't willing to give up there and
it's kept visiting offices and applying

92
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,600
for work. After four
months, she hit the Jackpot.

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,610
The New York world offered to let her
try out an assignment run by Joseph

94
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,420
Pulitzer. The paper was a prominent
publication as Bly. She was up to the job.

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,350
One of our first assignments at the New
York world's became her most famous.

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,620
It also made a difference with the
treatments of some of society's most

97
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,990
vulnerable people in
the late 19th century.

98
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,870
The mentally ill were locked
up and isolated from society.

99
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,950
One place they were sent in New York
was the women's lunatic asylum on

100
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,520
Blackwell's island and blinds or editors.
Well,

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,450
they want you to get
into that institution.

102
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,380
She was eager to do so even though she
didn't know how she was going to get out.

103
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,610
All she was told in preparation for this
assignment was write up things as you

104
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,110
find them good or bad.

105
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,640
Give praise and blame as you think
best as the truth. All the time.

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
She spent days preparing,

107
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,520
practicing facial expressions to make
herself seem as out of it as possible.

108
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,070
Then she went to a boarding
house to spend the night.

109
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,800
While there she pretended to be
afraid of everything at the house.

110
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,410
She spent hours just staring at the
wall and saying nothing in shorts.

111
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,990
She somebody did her best to act insane.

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,050
It works and the head of the boarding
house called the cops and Bly was taken

113
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,320
away. The police had around analyzed
by doctors at the Bellevue Hospital.

114
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,770
Bly claims to have an easier and so
case caught the attention of the media.

115
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,140
They knew one recognized
her as a journalist.

116
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,560
Ultimately the doctors were able to
recommends that this young pretty

117
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:19,460
independently insane women, the
committed to Blackwell island. Now,

118
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,140
even before she arrived at the asylum,

119
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,450
she had her first bit of
information for her expos.

120
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,510
A asylums apparently weren't
all that hard to get into.

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,440
When she arrived at this observation
was cemented for her as she knows other

122
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:30,921
patients.

123
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:34,370
He didn't seem to have all that much
reason to be locked up and away from

124
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,840
society once she was in the asylum blind.
Did an act at all.

125
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,620
She decided to just be
herself and interestingly this
didn't arouse suspicion at

126
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:46,310
all. In fact, it actually did the
opposite lay days are observed.

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,050
The more seemingly I talked in actors,

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,220
the crazier I was thought to be daily
life. It was tough at the asylum.

129
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,010
I was forced into cold
barbs and was freezing.

130
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,540
Most of the time that she was committed,

131
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,290
my teeth shattered and my limbs were
boost, flashed with blue and cold.

132
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,370
Suddenly I got one after the other three
buckets of water over my head, ice,

133
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:08,360
cold water to and to my ears,
my eyes, my nose and my mouth.

134
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,890
The food was horrific.

135
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,370
Dirty water served alongside rotting
meat grool ans nearly inedible bread.

136
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,930
Patient states and areas surrounded by
waste and with rats crawling around their

137
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:18,530
fees.

138
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,550
Their days were spent sitting on hard
benches and some patients were even tied

139
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,820
together in her initial newspaper reports
and it's later in a published book.

140
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,020
Bly described the horrific treatment of
asylum patients and how it's might be

141
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,880
making the patients even worse.

142
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,080
She wrote what accepting torture would
produce insanity quicker than this

143
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,900
treatments. Here is a class
of women sent it to be cured.

144
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,320
I would like the expert physicians
who are condemning me for my action,

145
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,800
which has proven their ability to take
a perfectly sane and healthy women,

146
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,780
shut her up and make us sit from 6:00
AM to 8:00 PM on straight back benches.

147
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,390
Did Not allow her to talk
or move during these hours.

148
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,040
Give her no reading and his letter,

149
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,240
no nothing of the world or it's doing
give her bad food and harsh treatment and

150
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,760
see how long it will
take to make her insane.

151
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,150
Two months would make her a
mental and physical wreck,

152
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,610
but I lasted 10 days of Blackwell islands.

153
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,090
She was released when the paper contacted
the asylum and asked for her release

154
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,820
two weeks days and the piece was published
in the New York worlds and it grabs

155
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:17,450
the attention of the country. People were
outraged and we're calling for change.

156
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,230
Your grand jury was convened and Bly
joins them in devising a series of changes

157
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,640
that needed to be made at the asylum.

158
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,390
The New York Department of charities and
corrections had $1 million out into its

159
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,580
budget to help with
improvements to the facilities.

160
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:32,480
The turnover oversaw and overall safer
and more humane conditions and treatments

161
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,360
were implemented at the asylums blind,
the Caymus celebrity.

162
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,020
She was praised for her bravery and her
willingness to speak out about societal

163
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:42,560
ills, but her work was far
from over. Even with our fame,

164
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,540
she keeps up undercover reporting.

165
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,700
The same year she went
down to cover the asylum.

166
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,580
Blind also went undercover for
a piece of a lighter nature.

167
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,910
She wants it to find out about the
active industry in New York City,

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,650
that sorts of fines,
women husbands, she wrote,

169
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,350
this has been getting interested me.
I didn't know what to marry,

170
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:02,220
but I was as interested as a little
boy with a dynamites cartridge.

171
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,660
On another occasion she wrote about a
Sadden York industry baby buying and she

172
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,900
indeed to come the New York government
exposing the actions that were prominent

173
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,570
lobbyist who was essentially
bribing lawmakers.

174
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Nellie Bly had no shortage of topics to
write on and is no shortage of courage.

175
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,010
Do you drive a forward
in her investigations but
her appetite for adventure

176
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:24,180
wasn't fully sated by writing articles
about the CD goings on of New York City

177
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,780
in 1888 she was 24 years
old and she has an idea,

178
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,170
she wants it to travel around the wells
and she wants it to do it faster than

179
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,960
Jewel's vins fictional character,
affiliates fog.

180
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,050
And of course she wanted to
write about it in the paper.

181
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,760
Although she's proven herself
from her past assignments, blight,

182
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,720
it's still faced reticence
from editors within working.

183
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,160
It was quite difficult for the times.

184
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,300
Women traveling by themselves was adding
a new layer of defiance to the Norse.

185
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,380
They wanted to send a man around the
world and not nearly as she later wrote.

186
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,860
The to her request was along the lines
of it is impossible for you to do.

187
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,200
It was the terrible
verdicts in the first place.

188
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:02,100
You are a woman and you would need a
protector and even if it were possible for

189
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,150
you to travel alone,

190
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,060
you would need to carry so much baggage
that it would detain you and making

191
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:09,060
rapid changes besides you speak.
Nothing but English,

192
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,360
so there is no use talking about it.
No one but a man.

193
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,620
We can do this and so what was their
response to this very well start the man

194
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,650
and I'll start the same day if some
other newspaper and to beat him.

195
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,160
It took a year but her is were eventually
convinced that she could make the

196
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:26,790
journey and that's I'm women traveled
with suitcases full of clothes and we're

197
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,290
often attended by escorts,

198
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,190
but again showed that she was ahead of
her time when the time came for her to

199
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,690
depart on her trip around the world.

200
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:38,691
In 1899 she boarded the ship or Augusta
Victoria by herself and with only two

201
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,990
small bags.

202
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,340
She wore a since and I ever coached and
kept a few $100 in a bag tied around her

203
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,770
neck. The first part of our
trip though it was tough,

204
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,990
but I got seasick and
couldn't hold down food.

205
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,210
The only thing that made her feel better,
we're sleeping.

206
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,690
At one point she slept for so long that
the ship's crew thought that she had

207
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,650
died in our cabin. She landed in
England's and went on to France in France.

208
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,790
She imagined Jewel's van,
the man who inspired the trip from France.

209
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,040
She traveled to Egypt,
say long Hong Kong and Japan and China.

210
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,140
She visited a lab colony along the way.

211
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,920
She traveled to board ships and rickshaws
and trains even riding horses when

212
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,990
needed to back home in the United States.

213
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:15,990
So readership was kept updated
via telegraph. All the time,

214
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,160
Bly was traveling the world.

215
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:20,520
People were keeping a close eye on the
dispatchers that she sends from abroad.

216
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,450
They had more than a passing interest
in her venture for van was a prize at

217
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,540
stake if the New York world's and
decided to make the most of blaze trip to

218
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,670
drive up their audience
and build their brands.

219
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,400
They offered a trip to Europe for the
person who was places to guessing and

220
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,440
blinds returns.
I'm starting points.

221
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,250
People made guesses literally
down to the seconds. Meanwhile,

222
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,310
they were also following another trip
around the world. Upon hearing of blinds,

223
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:41,670
stunts,

224
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,580
arrival in New York newspaper decided
they couldn't let the New York world to

225
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,420
get all the attention,

226
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,520
so they sent a female reporter of their
own around the globe and there's the

227
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,730
business left New York
heading the opposite way,

228
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,800
traversing the United States first before
heading across the Pacific business,

229
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,790
Lindsey took four days longer
than Bli to travel the world.

230
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,060
The final leg of blades global
trip was across the Pacific Ocean.

231
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,110
She made her way across the world's
largest ocean on the RMS oceanic,

232
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,150
but the ship hit rough
weather on the crossing.

233
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,440
Bly was two days later than she had
plans for her arrival back to the u s she

234
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,380
doesn't box in San Francisco
and boarded a private train.

235
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,150
Take her back to the east coast.

236
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,780
72 days after departing aboard
a ship and Hoboken New Jersey,

237
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,320
she was back not only hip, she'd beats
in Phineas fogs fictional record.

238
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,500
She had set a world record of her own.
Indeed Nellie Bly had once again proven.

239
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,250
Her niece says wrong.
She said,

240
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,240
I always have a comfortable feeling that
nothing is impossible if one applies a

241
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:37,390
certain amount of energy in the right
direction. When I want things done,

242
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,900
which is always at the last moment,
and as I am met with such an answer,

243
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,920
it's too late. I hardly think it
can be done. I simply say, nonsense.

244
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,620
If you want to do it, you can do it. The
question is, do you want to do it? Well,

245
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,900
I published a book about her adventure
and the New York world was happy with the

246
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,910
increased attention they
receive thanks to [inaudible],

247
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,470
but apparently they were not happy to
give blood a bonus insulted to this.

248
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,040
She resigned. She didn't have a job, but
she wasn't suffering quite the opposite.

249
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,460
She had become a national celebrity,
I religion name were worth money.

250
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:10,330
So popular had she become
with her adventure around
the world and by this point

251
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,050
she wasn't even 30 within three years
of our departure. Then New York wealth.

252
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,070
While they wanted her back,

253
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,090
she started writing for the paper
again in 1893 once again taking on

254
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,590
investigative assignments and these
assignments had the goal of reaching out

255
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,070
corruption and miss treatments.

256
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,530
No,

257
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,390
although she had always said that she
had no plans to Mary and had Indeed's

258
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,480
lived out her life in defiance of the
expectations of women by eventually matter

259
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,320
man and decided to settle down. In 1995
she met and married a 73 year old man.

260
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,430
Lied was just 31 oh husband's Roger
Seaman was the head of the iron class

261
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:51,570
manufacturing industry.

262
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,810
Marriage doesn't mean that blight was
ready to become a housewife and it's not

263
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,400
work. Quite the opposite. In fact,

264
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,940
she started to get involved with the
manufacturing company offering designs for

265
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:03,780
products and helping oversee
its operations to of the
designs she created with a

266
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:06,360
company with passengers and Milka
cat and then the garbage can.

267
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,080
In 1896 she quits working for the New
York world's to focus more of our time.

268
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,820
The ironclads manufacturing company.

269
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,020
When her husband died in 1904 she even
took over as its president how time in

270
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,590
that role and lasted less than a decade
as the company filed for bankruptcy in

271
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:23,880
1911 when the company failed blind jumps
right back into what she knew best and

272
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:26,790
that was reporting the women's
suffrage movement was in full swing.

273
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,480
Man's Bly wrote about the marches and
calls for the vote in the latter half of

274
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:34,440
the 1910s she covered world war one
giving her another groundbreaking title.

275
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,920
She was the first female war
correspondent in the United States,

276
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,330
fully back into journalism.

277
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:43,640
She got her own column in The New York
Journal in 1919 but sadly her sounds are

278
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,550
writing. Didn't last long. In 1922
when she was only 57 years old,

279
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,990
blind contracted pneumonia.

280
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,460
The oldest would prove to be the only
thing that keep her down on January the

281
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:57,461
27th 1922 by lost her life to pneumonia
at saint Mark's hospital in New York

282
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,980
City. Physically, the next day's
edition. If the evening journal Coulter,

283
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,990
the best reporter in America,

284
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,900
no Danny Bly

285
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,640
was a trailblazer.
Not just for women,

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,150
but for all journalists are writing
made a difference in people's lives

287
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,740
affecting change in government
and inspiring and lighting
people's imaginations

288
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,870
from an early age.
She showed great courage.

289
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,140
She knew what she wants it and she
went for it. That doing nothing,

290
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,410
especially not the fact that she
was a woman stand in our way.

291
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,040
How she was a writer, perhaps her
own words sum up her life best.

292
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,960
I said I could and I worked and I did so
I really hope you enjoyed that episode

00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:43,960
of biographics. If you did, there's a
couple of things you could do right now.

294
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:48,190
One is hit that like button below.
Also, if you want more stuff like this,

295
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:51,250

296
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,580

subscribe button doesn't do what it used

297

the subscribe button and that'll send you
