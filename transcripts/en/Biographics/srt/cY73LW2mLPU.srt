1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,230
Ebas meteoric rise to dominate
the personal transport
market has made it one of

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,100
the most successful and the
most hated companies in history,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,960
along with his controversial CEO,

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,830
Travis Kalanick.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,920
It has developed a reputation
as being iron fisted,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,220
cruel and relentless in
its pursuit of power,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,830
inspiring an equal measure
of admiration and loading.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,750
Uber has turned the traditional
taxi industry on its head
and provided customers

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,710
with a more user friendly way of
getting from point a to point b.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,050
okay.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,090
In the mid 19 nineties with the
worldwide web still in its infancy,

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,820
the undergraduate computer
science association,

13
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,821
or you see a Ucla University in Sunny
California was a breeding ground for

14
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,300
future millionaires.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,750
The association was more
of a clubhouse sweat.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,570
Likeminded students could relax after
class while they played games and talked

17
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,404
computers,

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,290
though not a founding member rate,

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,980
young San Fernando Valley residents by
the name of Travis Kalanick soon became a

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,500
central figure of the group.

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,160
Colonic was pursuing a double major in
computers and business just like the baby

22
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,260
of Internet companies up
north in Silicon Valley.

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,690
The USCPA was mostly fun and games.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,350
However,

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,640
soon it's members stumbled
upon an opportunity because
there were no firewalls

26
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,210
back then.

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,620
It was possible to search for files on
all connect to computers and then index

28
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,400
the results.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,730
The group decided to replicate the
time honored practice of college.

30
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,470
Kids lending out their record albums,

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,760
but they were able to extend the
lending for Tennessee to anybody who was

32
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,810
connected to the Internet.

33
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,740
The idea was molded into a
startup which they named scour.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,180
It was a tool that would scrub it,

35
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,110
networks files,

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,730
looking for mp3s.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,510
Travis Kalanick was not involved in the
founding of scour because he was doing

38
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,680
an internship within cell,

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,070
but as scour became established
and grew in popularity,

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,180
he'd jumped on board.

41
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,400
He was in charge of
marketing and fundraising.

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,301
It was in this role.

43
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:01,710
There's colonic developed the on the job
training that would serve him in later

44
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,180
years living at his parent's house.

45
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,760
He would spend up to eight
hours a day on the phone,

46
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,370
wheeling and dealing in
order to attract investors.

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,420
In 1999,

48
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,680
his efforts paid off when Hollywood power
player Michael Ovitz port $4,000,000

49
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:18,270
into scour in return for a 51 percent
share in the company within a year.

50
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:18,720
However,

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,710
the writing was on the wall for scour
it's success had attracted to competitor

52
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,150
who would do things better.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,150
This competitor was napster.

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,450
Scour is fundamental.

55
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,820
Problem was that it
didn't scale these sites.

56
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:34,140
Words often crashed through over use
and scour was running out of fresh

57
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:34,950
concepts.

58
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,491
Meanwhile,

59
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:38,130
napster was paying close
attention to scour problems.

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,790
They introduced a tweak I listening
to a song would automatically make it

61
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,720
available to others.

62
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,500
As a result,

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,050
napster quickly became a viral sensation.

64
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,860
Scour tried to gain grounds by
moving into sharing movie files,

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,560
but ultimately they were deemed the
company went into bankruptcy in two

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,513
thousands.

67
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,223
By the end of that,

68
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,430
with scour gone.

69
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,350
Twenty four year olds,

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Travis Kalanick had no
college degree and no job.

71
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,990
He needed a new plan
and they needed it fast.

72
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,730
Within weeks of the folding of scour,

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,500
calumnick was onto his next project.

74
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,610
He teams up with former scour partner
Michael Todd to form red swoosh,

75
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,090
which was essentially scour
recreated for business customers.

76
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,410
This new startup would allow companies
to use the Internet to share similarly

77
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,240
large files with their customers.

78
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,750
Enabling large file movements
was already big business,

79
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,160
but red swoosh is competitive.

80
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:34,780
Advantage was that it capitalized on the
asset light strategy to keep its costs

81
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,100
below that of competitors.

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,450
Redswoosh pushed and pulled files from
personal computers owned by others,

83
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,980
foreshadowing what uber would later do
in connecting writers with drivers who's

84
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,880
caused represented massive
unused capital on city streets.

85
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,740
As the CEO of red squares.

86
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,130
Colonics job was to pitch the
potential clients as he had done it,

87
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:58,120
scour who sat a forensic
work based proving to be the
quintessential workaholic,

88
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,901
just what it is,

89
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,040
gone Ganju and efforts.

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,580
However,

91
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,790
redswoosh became a victim of
the peaking of the Internet.

92
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,410
Bubble investments dried up and
tensions rose calumnick blamed for

93
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,191
mismanagement,

94
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,650
sins wrangled for him to be
kicked out of the company,

95
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,940
colonic capital willing,

96
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,760
and it looked as if he had found
a savior on September the 11th,

97
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,571
2001.

98
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,470
He was scheduled to meet with a potential
partner investor named Danny Lewin.

99
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,070
Lewin,

100
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,550
however,

101
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,270
was on board American Airlines
flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles,

102
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,340
which crashed into the
north tower of the world.

103
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,000
Trade Center is the one that he was
the first day after confronting the

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,480
hijackers by the end of 2001
red swoosh was out of money.

105
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,530
Reprieve came in the form of a father and
son team who had made a fortune from a

106
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,670
semiconductor business,

107
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,320
James and Jerry Chow.

108
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,210
They agreed to pour $300,000 into the
business in return for a 30 percent stake

109
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,410
over the next few years.

110
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,011
Red swoosh,

111
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:48,844
stumbled along,

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,530
propped up by further investments,

113
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,530
and then in April of
2007 major competitor,

114
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,730
Akamai purchased the company hiring the
handful of employees of the company,

115
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,840
including Collar Kalanick was now 31
years old for his share in the sale of red

116
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:03,190
swoosh.

117
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,620
He had pocketed around $3,000,000.

118
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,100
Yes,

119
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,310
he was now tied to a large
corporation as an employee,

120
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,470
something he had never experienced before.

121
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,700
Over the next year,

122
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,700
he works to continue building
the red switch brands.

123
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,650
At the same time,

124
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,140
the restyled himself as an angel
investor for young entrepreneurs.

125
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,950
He bought an old house in the Castro
and Old San Francisco neighborhood and

126
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,660
named it the jam pat that's became a
meeting place for fresh tech based ideas

127
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,494
with no money.

128
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,820
Calumnick reveled in the role of is the
oldest age who had been there and done

129
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,390
that.

130
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,901
His blog,

131
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,130
which was called swishing,

132
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,920
became essential reading in it.

133
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,890
He described his home,

134
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:43,720
the jam pad as a place where entrepreneurs
regularly come to hang out to rap on

135
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,350
ideas,

136
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,850
to jam with other entrepreneurs,

137
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,860
to play tennis and gears of war,

138
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,980
and to have a fantastic healthy meals
made by the jam pads in house chef colonic

139
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,761
quits,

140
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,480
red swoosh in late 2008.

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,060
He spent the next couple of years biding
his time as he examined new business

142
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,810
ventures.

143
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,910
He also threw himself
into leisure activities.

144
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,300
He became a part of a group called
the random traveler society.

145
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,130
They would randomly spin a globe to you,

146
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:08,690
decide where in the
world they would travel.

147
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,980
In 2010 colonic got heavily involved with
the q and a website called formspring.

148
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,990
He invested in the company
that was soon running the show.

149
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,000
At the same time,

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,520
he was still looking
for other opportunities.

151
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,690
He was introduced to a smartphone APP by
the idea of an old friend named Garrett

152
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,320
camp.

153
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,950
The APP was called Uber Cab and it's
allowed the user to make a quick contact

154
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,960
with the limousine in
the San Francisco area.

155
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,560
Galenic began sharing his time between
formspring spring and Uber Cab.

156
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,200
Within a few months it became obvious
that he had to choose between them.

157
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,230
The people that form spring were
pushing him to become their CEO,

158
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,370
but in late September,

159
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,270
2010,

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,130
he walked into a board
meeting and declared,

161
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,770
I'm going to be Uber.

162
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,150
In the summer of 2008 Garrett camp,

163
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:55,940
a miles managed Canadian software
designer was waiting for a cab in San

164
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,420
Francisco Bay area.

165
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,950
He'd been waiting nearly 30 minutes for
a cab that had promised to be there in

166
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,710
just 15 when he saw an empty cab
from a competitor company come by.

167
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,210
He hailed it and got in.

168
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,120
A few minutes later,

169
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,530
he got a call from the original
taxi company asking where he was.

170
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,750
He replied that they relate,

171
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,500
so he had gotten in another taxi.

172
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,900
This became a regular occurrence for camp.

173
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,090
Eventually both taxi
companies that he dealt with,

174
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,310
luck,

175
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,920
soar and yellow blacklisted him.

176
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,030
This annoying the young Canadians who
just so happened to have $75,000,000 in

177
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:27,380
his bank account after selling his first
startup stumble upon hailing a cab was

178
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,580
now more difficult for camp.

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,460
The taxi switchboard companies who had
cut him off as soon as they saw his

180
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:34,970
number one evening while standing on
a street corner and running late for a

181
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:35,420
date.

182
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,520
He had the proverbial light bulb moments.

183
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,860
He had his brand new
apple iphone in his hands.

184
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,570
That phone was gps enabled.

185
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,950
Why couldn't he requests a cab directly
from his phone simply by pushing a

186
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,030
button that says,

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
pick me up this way.

188
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,910
You cut out the dispatcher,

189
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,350
entirely gamble,

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,480
so knew that the iphone included
a thing called an accelerometer.

191
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,990
This allowed for the tracking
of not just where a car was,

192
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:01,460
but also how fast it was moving with this
technology map could be generated that

193
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:05,510
showed the beginning and end of the
trip along with its duration and price.

194
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,560
It would also have lengthy rider with
the driver cutting out the middleman and

195
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,190
August the eighth,

196
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,600
2008 campaign.

197
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,640
Thirty $5 to reserve the website.

198
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,111
Uber.

199
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:15,200
The cab dot Khan,

200
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,560
he then began to elicit feedback
about his idea from his circle of

201
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,790
entrepreneurial friends.

202
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,970
He also interviewed a taxi driver who
complained about the hours that they were

203
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,770
sitting idly waiting for a fat.

204
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,990
Slowly other people
began jumping on board.

205
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,080
One of them was Travis
Kalanick in early 2009.

206
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,400
Travis contributed in an idea that
became pivotal to the future of the Uber

207
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,490
Model.

208
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,290
Rather than buying a fleet of vehicles,

209
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,610
which camp was envisioning clinic told
him that he didn't need to buy cars,

210
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,150
just give the APP to drivers
and let them be free agents.

211
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,010
They would work when they wanted to work.

212
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,780
The focus for both men was on limousine
rides rather than normal taxi cab rides

213
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,960
clinic signed on as an advisor that
you go with a 10 percent stake in the

214
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,530
company.

215
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,250
It took over a year to develop the APP
by January 2010 campaign candidate again

216
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,330
testing the service.

217
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,140
They also began making plans to
launch operations in San Francisco.

218
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
Colonic had a 27 year olds,

219
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:10,560
General Electric Middle
Management employee named
Ryan Graves to oversee these

220
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,820
San Francisco launch.

221
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,560
Graves began visiting marriages.

222
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,220
Do you sign up?

223
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,053
Limo drivers.

224
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,530
The service launched in late May of
2010 with just a handful of drivers and

225
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,250
customers.

226
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,700
The original customer base
came from twitter followers
who had been keeping tabs

227
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,540
on what the entrepreneurs were obsolete
colonic and graves who had been made CEO

228
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,050
again,

229
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,500
working together to find investors
after receiving a lot of knock backs.

230
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,630
The C funding rounds raised one point two,

231
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,830
$5,000,000.

232
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,000
It was at this point the clinic
decided to go full time with Uber Cab,

233
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,750
but he wasn't content to play second
fiddle to a guy that he had hired.

234
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,730
He orchestrated a demotion for graves
and claims the title of CEO for himself.

235
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,930
He also demanded that his shareholding
rise from 10 percent to 23 percent.

236
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,330
On the very day that kind nick became CEO.

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,770
The company received a cease and desist
from the San Francisco Metro Transit

238
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,870
Authority and California
Public Utilities Commission.

239
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,860
It stated that the name Uber Cab meant
that they were a taxi cab company and

240
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,090
under the authorities direction colonic
solve this problem in five seconds,

241
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,980
he simply changed the name of the company
from Uber Cab to simply uber at the

242
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,990
time of his taking over the operation.

243
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,420
It was tiny and it made
plenty of mistakes.

244
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,000
On Halloween of 2010,

245
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,750
they offered a discount to writers.

246
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,650
This created such a huge demands
on their already busiest day yet,

247
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,880
but it left a lot of people unable to get
a right despite this growth was steady

248
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,320
throughout 2010.

249
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,840
Then over the 2011 new year period,

250
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,970
it absolutely blew up.

251
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,660
Word of mouth was responsible for the
exponential growth in Uber's customer

252
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,170
base,

253
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,730
but finding limo drivers,

254
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
well that was a different story.

255
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,740
They didn't have the same social media
habits as the young about towners in need

256
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:47,071
of a limo,

257
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:47,520
right?

258
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,850
Only licensed drivers were
eligible to drive for Uber.

259
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,090
They all had customers if their own
and none of them were prepared to go

260
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,640
exclusive with uber
either began giving away.

261
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,160
Iphone is preloaded with
the Uber App to drivers.

262
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,770
This enabled them to
increase their driver supply,

263
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,770
to keep up with the ever
growing demand in San Francisco.

264
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,690
Having proven the model in San Francisco,

265
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,860
colonic started to replicated in other
cities under the guidance of the head of

266
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:11,491
operations,

267
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:12,324
Ryan Graves,

268
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,280
they turned their attention to Seattle,

269
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,120
Chicago,

270
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,870
Boston,

271
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,180
and Washington DC.

272
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,193
In each city.

273
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,100
Graves made connections in the tech world.

274
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:20,730
First.

275
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,280
This created buzz and
attracted cutting edge Jesus.

276
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,930
Once the word was being generated,

277
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,010
they began looking for drivers and
working through government regulations.

278
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,780
As they moved from city to city,

279
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:33,090
the Uber team began
refining their playbook,

280
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,200
refining the system,

281
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,180
and making us more efficient.

282
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,650
This process became one established
buzz in the tech community to assess

283
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:41,550
regulations.

284
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,090
Three,

285
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,760
recruiting drivers for developed pricing.

286
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Five,

287
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,860
we local media and six capitalized
with social media buzz.

288
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,671
In the early days,

289
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:53,920
calumnick was a master at
local public relations.

290
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,400
Promotion would start with a blog post
in which you would relate how much he

291
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,234
loved the city,

292
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,350
where they were moving in suit.

293
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,140
He would highlight it's key attributes
and then he would talk about how much

294
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,880
greater the city would be.

295
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,420
When Uber had introduced
their service by 2011,

296
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,770
the job of securing investment,

297
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,450
it was much easier in February,

298
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:14,170
benchmark capital pour $10,000,000
into the company at this point.

299
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,840
If it was valued at $60,000,000,

300
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,960
the company had 9,000 customers and one
point $8 million dollars in net revenue.

301
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,900
It was estimated that
it would get to $100,

302
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,661
million dollars.

303
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,500
Gross revenue within a year had
achieved that goal in six months.

304
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,090
As we burst sprang up in more
and more cities across America,

305
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,650
it began to receive pushback.

306
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,350
The sixth city that it went
into was Washington DC.

307
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,680
Before they could get it off the ground,

308
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:46,570
whoever the city's taxi commissioner
announced that it was operating an illegal

309
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,790
taxi operation on Martin Luther King.

310
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,050
Day Two Thousand and 11,

311
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,740
the commissioner ordered an uber which
took him to a press conference at the

312
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,850
mayflower hotel.

313
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,920
He then proceeded to impounds the
driver's car and issued a $20,000 tickets,

314
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,750
but either they didn't back down.

315
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,440
They assured all drivers that they would
pay all of their fines and took the

316
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:09,580
moral high grounds in public asserting
that they would not a taxi company and

317
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,810
therefore not subject to
regulatory provisions in one city.

318
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,670
After another taxi companies,

319
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:20,380
the taxi commission and local and state
agencies came into uber to shut it down.

320
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,000
Under the guidance of consultants,

321
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,870
Bradley Tusk,

322
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,040
Iba fought back.

323
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,770
They ran social media
campaigns to stop the opposers,

324
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,270
often meeting them in court.

325
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,420
The public were overwhelmingly
on the side of the company,

326
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,340
but there was one thing that Uber's
customers were not happy about during busy

327
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:39,070
periods such as rush hour
into bar closing times.

328
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,970
It would apply surge pricing with the
rates going up during these peak demand

329
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:43,630
times.

330
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,590
Surge pricing had the effect
of encouraging more drivers
to work and encouraging

331
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,720
some customers to find
the cheapest service.

332
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,600
Both of these results is
the demand on the service,

333
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,880
but it also infuriated the customer base.

334
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,670
Many of them blamed the unfairness of
surge pricing at the foot of CEO Kalanick,

335
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,790
who quickly became known as a cutthroat
business man who refused to listen to

336
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,960
consumer sentiments.

337
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
By the end of 2012,

338
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,820
Uber was operating in 27
locations in that year.

339
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:13,510
They also introduced uber x
providing rides and hybrid cars,

340
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,820
but it was also the year that Uber faced.

341
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,470
It's first serious competition.

342
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,650
It's getting from a young San
Francisco company called Lyft.

343
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,700
Lyft was a ride sharing business whereby
a person would slap a launch pink

344
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:28,330
mustache on the grill of their car and
then pick up those you're in need of a

345
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:31,840
ride for the shared cost of gas
and a little extra donation.

346
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,650
Usually this would work out to be less
than the cab fare for the same distance

347
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,650
to use a smartphone app that
was modeled off the Uber App.

348
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,590
Lyft was a hit with young people
who preferred it's friendlier,

349
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,380
more laid back.

350
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,490
Image riding in a limo was
starting to look elitist.

351
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,210
As a result,

352
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,490
uber sat about
restructuring its game plan.

353
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,360
It would rebrand itself with a focus
on getting a from point a to point B as

354
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:55,940
quickly and inexpensively as possible.

355
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,660
Uberx,

356
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,600
which had started out as an ECO
friendly alternative to a limo,

357
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,110
became the means of being
traditional taxi services.

358
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,470
In early 2014 colonic hard
former Amazon executive,

359
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:10,310
Jeff Holden as product development
manager holding identified two things he

360
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,960
found lacking in the uber system,

361
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,860
the ability of the writer to communicate
beforehand where he wanted to go,

362
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,230
and the driver's ability to navigate that.

363
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,590
He oversaw two new features
to fix this destination,

364
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,730
input by the writer and turn by
turn navigation on the driver app,

365
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,240
both features where it hits,

366
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:28,700
and by the end of 2004,

367
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,990
Eva was operating in
262 markets worldwide.

368
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,170
Uber was now a genuine phenomenon,

369
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,320
but it was a phenomenon that
had attracted a lot of enemies.

370
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:39,601
Now,

371
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:43,370
a lot's of that animosity was thanks
to the brash nature of the CEO,

372
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,390
Travis Kalanick,

373
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,350
his outspokenness and inability to
hold his tongue made him the offender.

374
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,550
In chief clinic was the poster
boy for political incorrectness,

375
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,660
one stating that he could land women
as quickly as a person could summon an

376
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,380
uber.

377
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:57,891
Colonics.

378
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,060
Dificid personality only underscored
hoover's growing reputation as a bully in

379
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:02,894
the marketplace.

380
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,590
Reports were publicized if some
underhanded tactics used to undermine

381
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,041
competitor.

382
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,420
Lyft publications began labeling Uber as
an evil company and describing a ceo as

383
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:13,730
an an rand's loving libertarian nutjob.

384
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,690
In some cities,

385
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,510
it became politically correct
to avoid either altogether.

386
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,450
It was in a strange position worldwide.

387
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:23,000
It's business was growing
from strength to strength.

388
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,751
At the same time,

389
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:24,230
however,

390
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,060
it's reputation was tanking.

391
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,490
Things went from bad to abysmal.

392
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,550
When an uber driver in Delhi was
convicted of raping a passenger,

393
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,170
something had to be done.

394
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,580
I didn't have to be done quick.

395
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,710
In 2015,

396
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,530
Uber brought on a new executive to
oversee digital and physical safety.

397
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,430
Joe Sullivan,

398
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,210
he had a long to do list including a
stricter management of driver activity.

399
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,200
Things were tightened up to the extent
that Iba management can tell if a driver

400
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,580
is holding his phone while driving or
braking too hard or going too fast.

401
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,630
During that year,

402
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,750
another new executive,

403
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:59,751
Sally K said about us taking
and overcoming a slew of
local regulators who were

404
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:02,510
intent on stopping uber in its tracks.

405
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,400
By the beginning of 2016,

406
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,780
Uber was on a more even keel rather
than lurching from crisis to another.

407
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,030
In an attempt to change its image,

408
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,410
the company teamed up with mothers
against drunk driving to encourage young

409
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:18,230
people to take an uber
rather than drink and drive.

410
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,800
It also partnered with hospitals to
make it cheaper for cancer patients to

411
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,090
return home from treatments.

412
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,810
Travis Kalanick has been working on
introducing driverless cars to the Uber

413
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:32,630
makes since 2013.

414
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,890
He loved the idea that it would no
longer rely on the most uncontrollable of

415
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,090
business variables,

416
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,990
people,

417
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,250
autonomous vehicles would be far safer
as robots are not subject to drowsiness

418
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:44,084
or distraction.

419
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,070
Further robots would
be cheaper than people,

420
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,360
but in 2013,

421
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,180
the technology,

422
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,040
it wasn't ready yet.

423
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,820
By February of 2014,

424
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,600
Uber was canvassing the world looking
for top robotics talents or purchase a

425
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:57,090
pittsburgh company
called Carnegie robotics,

426
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,330
making it the kernel of
it's self driving car team.

427
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,450
Then in December of 2014,

428
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,510
hired 60 researchers from the
national robotics engineering center.

429
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
After two years of development,

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Uber announced in August
2016 that it's caused.

431
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,500
We're ready for unlimited showing.

432
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,451
The call has worked,

433
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,790
but they still require a human engineer
behind the steering wheel just in case

434
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,660
something went wrong.

435
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,210
Uber are today still working
on their driverless car.

436
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,050
In that quest,

437
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,090
they are in a race with
the likes of Google,

438
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,630
apple,

439
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,380
and Tesla,

440
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,890
the latter of which is rumored to be
considering its own ride sharing business.

441
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,010
All of this competition will
ultimately result in a better,

442
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,270
cheaper service for those of us who are
wanting to get from point a to point b

443
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,150
as effectively and cost
efficiently as possible.

444
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,210
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

445
