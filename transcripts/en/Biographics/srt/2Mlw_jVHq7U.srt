1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330
Satoshi Nakamoto invented
bitcoin and more importantly,

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,400
it's underlying blockchain technology.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,380
No matter what the
future price of bitcoin.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,090
Maybe the real treasure is blockchain
because it's going to change the world as

5
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,970
much as the Internet did in the 1990s

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,930
Satoshi Nakamoto was nominated for the
Nobel Prize in economics and he has a

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,220
multibillionaire and yet no one
knows what he actually looks like.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,560
He might not even be a
single person in the name,

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,430
may serve as a cover for a group who
came together for the sake of starting a

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:37,950
digital revolution on
today's buying graphics.

11
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:41,370
We're going to go over what we know about
this little known figure is what does

12
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,280
the theories behind his secret identity.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,570
Okay.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,290
In the 1980s and nineties that closest
thing you had to a cool gang of

15
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,990
rebellious computer hackers
was the cypherpunks.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,040
They were computer programmers who were
interested in creating absolute privacy

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,300
in the digital world.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,050
They specialized in creating ciphers that
were nearly impossible to break into.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,250
Many of them were anarchists since
Libertarians who believes that everyone

20
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:14,540
should be connected online
without government interference.
Sadly, as we now know,

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,650
the Internet is anything but free you
from the watchful eyes of the NSA,

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,520
many of the cypherpunks experiments and
in the idea that the internet could be

23
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:25,820
used to send digital money
without the use of a middleman.

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,200
David trauma invented Digi cash in 1989
and he published an academic paper on

25
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:34,400
the subject, another one of the
Cypherpunks, Nick Savo created bit gold.

26
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,400
All of these,
they were close but no cigar.

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,670
Even though the Cypherpunks
had this idea conceived,

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,870
they couldn't actually come up with a
technical way to accomplish a true peer to

29
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,330
peer experience. You see, when
you're using the Internet,

30
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:51,740
your depending on your Internet service
provider and they need to abide by the

31
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,300
laws of each respective country.

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,300
With apps like paypal and Venmo
sending money to your friends,

33
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:59,330
it probably seems like an
instant peer to peer experience,

34
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,070
at least for you as the customer,

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,790
but behind the scenes these companies
still have to settle bank transactions the

36
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,720
old fashioned way.

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,680
This is three days worth of paperwork
through an antiquated and expensive system

38
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,220
called swift. If this sounds
ridiculous in this day and age,

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,900
that's because it really is.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,430
The global digital banking system has
been long do an overhaul. Further.

41
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,950
After the 2008 stock
market crash the world,

42
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:25,010
it was primed and ready
for a financial revolution.

43
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,240
In October of 2008 someone going by the
name of Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper

44
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:33,260
called Bitcoin,
a peer to peer electronic cash system.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,400
He began to email all the cypherpunks
asking if they were willing to help him

46
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:41,150
create his idea of a new system
that he called blockchain.

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,570
This was a computer network
that she truly was peer to peer.

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,770
There would be no fear that your Internet
service provider, which shut it down.

49
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,730
The blockchain is basically an accounting
system that records all transactions

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,900
on a public ledger.

51
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,430
Instead of the U s dollar value would be
exchanged in a digital currency called

52
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,690
bitcoin.
New bitcoins have to be created by mining,

53
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:05,440
which is a process of computers attempting
to solve a difficult math problem.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,910
Once the cipher is solved, the minor is
rewarded with a bitcoin. In the beginning.

55
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:14,110
One bitcoin was only worth fractions of
a penny back then and he run of the mill

56
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,740
computer you just got from your
local best buy could handle mining,

57
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:22,120
bitcoin and anyone could
receive and deposit the currency
in that digital wallet.

58
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,460
The blockchain itself exists in the cloud,

59
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:28,960
which is a sort of hive minds that does
not exist in any physical location.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,200
This means that no government in the
world is the ability to shut it down

61
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,550
because as long as there are minors
somewhere out there in the welds you were

62
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,070
running the blockchain,
bitcoin will continue to exist.

63
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,980
Even though it was the solution there
had been searching for many of the

64
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,040
cypherpunks ignored.
Satoshi Nakamoto is ideas.

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,840
The thing is they weren't kids anymore.

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,680
They were in their forties and 50s and
they'd already tried and failed to make

67
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,130
that own digital currencies.
The idea of bitcoin.

68
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,160
It was so radical that it seems like
something out of a science fiction movie,

69
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,450
but one could be program
are from California named
how Finny saw its potential

70
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:05,020
and he was the first best and to
take Sitoshi neck Emoto seriously.

71
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,260
He asked to work on the bitcoin project
for free and so on January the third

72
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:11,380
2009 bitcoin was first launched health,

73
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,950
any institution knack in America who
have never met face to face and they've

74
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,210
never spoken over the phone.

75
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,100
Now can Mojo left his email address on
the big coin website allowing anyone's

76
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,080
contact him with any questions that
they might have about the project.

77
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,063
This led to many,

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,010
the program is joining in and
helping them in the very beginning.

79
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,780
This idea of it was only
popular to anarchists and
Libertarians who had the goal

80
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:34,180
of living their lives free
from governmental rule.

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,380
While they are small in number,

82
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:38,980
this community is incredibly passionate
about their philosophies to this very

83
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,630
day. They were the first ones do cling
on to this bitcoin revolution and as many

84
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,760
calls Satoshi Nakamoto hero.

85
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,813
Yeah,

86
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,291
of course.

87
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,950
Once the word got out that bitcoin
was a way to transfer money privately,

88
00:04:55,951 --> 00:05:00,951
it was almost immediately adopted by
criminals and 2011 a website called the

89
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,150
Silk Road appeared in a
web browser called Tor,

90
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,370
which is used to browse the dark web.

91
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,440
The founders are in
kingpin of the Silk Road,

92
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,080
goes by the name of dread pirate Roberts,

93
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,970
like the character from
the princess bride.

94
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,890
You can buy anything on the Silk Road
including human slaves and hit orders from

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,940
assassins. Since most of these
transactions, they're all done in bitcoin.

96
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,090
In 2013 a 29 year olds man named Ross
Albrecht was arrested under suspicion of

97
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,960
being the dread pirate Roberts.

98
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,880
In 2015 he was convicted of conspiracy
to transfer narcotics since,

99
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,960
since he was labeled as an evil king.

100
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:38,961
Then he was given not just one but two
life sentences plus an additional 40

101
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,490
years without the possibility of parole.

102
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,600
The average silkroad drug dealer and
he got five to 10 years behind bars.

103
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,620
Most people in the cryptocurrency
community believed that
old was just a patsy

104
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,110
and the real dread pirate
Roberts has gotten free.

105
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,160
The FBI seized Russell breaks cache of
bitcoins and auction them off to the

106
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,060
highest bidder while all bricks
was in solitary confinement.

107
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,330
Someone else logged in to the dread
pirate Roberts comes on the Silk Road.

108
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,890
Either he had passed the account to
another King Ben or they truly did arrest

109
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,130
the wrong man, so one's a bit coin that
started getting a lot of bad press.

110
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,970
The Towson I can moto was very upset to
see how his project was being used for

111
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:14,450
evil.

112
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,980
The last nine person to have communicated
with Sitoshi Nakamoto was Gavin

113
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,320
Andresen programmer who
looked up to NAC and motor.

114
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:26,321
It was his mentor and hero when the
FBI and CIA came looking for Sitoshi

115
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,360
Nakamoto.

116
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,990
Gavin Andresen agreed to speak with
them about bitcoin on the mysterious

117
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:33,340
founders behalf because he wanted
to help educate them about water.

118
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,790
Blockchain technology actually is this
must have fries and Dac and motor because

119
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,380
he pick cut off ties with the rest of
the original bitcoin team. Since then,

120
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:46,850
Satoshi Nakamoto is bitcoin public wallet
addresses remained untouched even in

121
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,780
2017 when the price balloon
to $20,000 per coin.

122
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,760
He has never withdrawn his money.

123
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,970
He should be one of the
richest men in the world's,

124
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,270
but he has decided not to spend a
penny of it for people who were paying

125
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:01,580
attention to bitcoin since its inception.

126
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,510
Many founders that they could
turn blockchain technology
into an opportunity to

127
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,650
make their own businesses.

128
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,940
Since the code for blockchain was open
source and free for anyone to use,

129
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:14,180
it could be improved and builds
upon boy genius. Vitalik.

130
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:18,310
Buterin was just 17 years old when he
began to learn how to code blockchain and

131
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,060
founds in Bitcoin magazine.

132
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,710
He gains a loss of respect from people
who were much older than he was and he

133
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,240
proposed a new project called ethereum.

134
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,940
This wasn't just another coin
to compete with bitcoin there.

135
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,520
It was far faster and cheaper runs.

136
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,090
People could build their own
businesses upon the ethereum platform.

137
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,070
These were called ICO or initial
coin offerings. Unfortunately though,

138
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:44,600
the vast majority of these crypto currency
businesses were and still are total

139
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,030
scams,
the government's agencies of the world,

140
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,580
they suddenly had a whole lot more to
worry about than just bitcoin because on

141
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,110
educated people around the world
started to dump their life savings into

142
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,020
fraudulent companies in the hopes
that it would be the next bitcoin.

143
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,831
At the moment,

144
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:02,240
there are very few alternative coins
that are legitimate companies and not

145
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,810
simply scamps. At the
time. This video was neat.

146
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,220
The number two cryptocurrency
in the world is riddle.

147
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,510
This is because there aren't actual
corporation led by the former CEO of AOL,

148
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,860
Brad Garlinghouse.

149
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,610
They have offices in multiple countries
where they have hundreds of employees

150
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,870
working to educate major corporations
about what blockchain can help them do.

151
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,960
They are already working hands in
hands with the Federal Reserve and have

152
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,350
contracts with over 200 banks who have
agreed to use their currency. XRP.

153
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:31,640
You just settled trillions of dollars
in bank transactions in the future.

154
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,031
Well,

155
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:42,260
many of the leaders in traditional finance
and tacker trying to figure out how

156
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:45,830
to incorporate blockchain in the
real wells. There are the purists.

157
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:50,831
You still passionately believe in the
anarchist ideals of the cypherpunks and of

158
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,100
Satoshi Nakamoto.

159
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,890
Many of these original followers were
made multimillionaires by their initial

160
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,580
investments.

161
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,580
While some of these people who are
coders who understood the blockchain

162
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,450
technology, the majority of them had no
background in computer science at all,

163
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,470
and we're supporting bitcoin simply
for the fact that they believed in its

164
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,130
philosophy.
[inaudible] Moto.

165
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,840
It was never the CEO of bitcoin because
it's not even a business entity.

166
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,550
He was never trying to be a leader,

167
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:18,330
but the level of reverence that some
people have for him has been compared to a

168
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:21,840
cult on multiple occasions
without a leader to guide them.

169
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:26,040
Bitcoin believers debate over the
question of what would Sitoshi do?

170
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,820
They created an analyze this
old emails and his publications.

171
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,600
The reddit boards are filled with heated
debates trying to interpret Sitoshi as

172
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,690
words as if they're their Bible.
At this point in time,

173
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,920
bitcoin transactions take several hours
or even days to go through and they cost

174
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,470
roughly $40 in fees per transaction.

175
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,130
It's got to the point where it's almost
as expensive and as slow as the bolt

176
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,610
score banking system. The idea of
saying bitcoin will be around forever.

177
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,210
It's kind of like saying that dial up
internet should still be around to,

178
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,450
even though the TAC has been in
a serious downward spiral ends,

179
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:01,170
other companies like ripple
have drastically improved
upon blockchain technology

180
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:05,100
in recent years. Much of the bitcoin
community is just in total denial.

181
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,630
They continue to have blind faith in
the original bitcoin and is in a man or

182
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,050
group who isn't even around
anymore to give their input.

183
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,800
The original programmer of Bitcoin,
how Finny suffered from als,

184
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,890
also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
If you aren't already aware,

185
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:23,640
this is the same year edge degenerative
disease that immobilized Stephen Hawking

186
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,510
is where someone's brain is fully
functional but they no longer have control

187
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,344
over their body.

188
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,920
The timeline of how Finney's condition
getting worse actually lines up with

189
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,470
Satoshi Nakamoto deciding to disappear.

190
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,260
Andy Greenberg is senior
writer at wired magazine,

191
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,230
made the connection and he believed
that he had cracked the case.

192
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:42,330
So you went to interview him.
At this point,

193
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,060
Pal Finney was in a wheelchair
and he could no longer speak.

194
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,640
He could only answer yes or no questions.

195
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,500
Greenburg asked point blank if it's
true that he was Sitoshi knack and Moto

196
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,370
Finney's eyes. Glistened and
amusements anti promptly responded. No.

197
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,870
Even though how funny has
become a multimillionaire
from mining bitcoin in the

198
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,520
early days of the projects,
no amounts of money,

199
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,140
you could save him from the disease,

200
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:07,980
but maybe he could postpone the
inevitable on the brink of death.

201
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,640
Funding requested that his body be
cryogenically frozen in the hopes that

202
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,180
someday he would be unfrozen
and give them the cure to als.

203
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,950
In 2014 he passed away and his body
was transported to a lab in Arizona,

204
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,020
just two miles away from
health and he's home.

205
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:24,720
The FBI showed up on someone's
property with a warrant.

206
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,960
They dragged out a mountain with black
hair and glasses and the rest of the demo

207
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:30,930
under suspicion of being the
mysterious founder of Bitcoin,

208
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,010
he insisted over and over that he had
no idea what they were talking about is

209
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:38,490
full legal name. Oh, that would
be Dorian. Satoshi Nakamoto

210
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,940
off to the PAP RNC showed up at his
doorstep and he was falsely reported that

211
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,270
Dory institution now can moto.
It was the true founder of Bitcoin.

212
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,270
This sends him into the spotlight of the
media and he had to go on record with

213
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,780
the Associated Press insisting that he
did not have anything to do with the

214
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:03,040
project and that someone had clearly
taken. His name is a pseudonym today.

215
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:07,900
Dorian Nakamoto has been affectionately
titled the Fake Satoshi and members of

216
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,770
the community actually love him.
His face was even turned into a meme.

217
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,150
Many people felt sorry that he was dragged
into this and even donated bitcoins

218
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:21,151
to him as a sort of sorry for the mix up
in 2017 those donations inflated to be

219
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:26,161
worth $273,000 and he quickly
cashed out at just the right time.

220
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,831
Today,

221
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,940
Dorian Nakamoto has actually embraced
the community and he now enjoys being a

222
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,560
celebrity and taking photos with his fans.
Then in 2015 yes,

223
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,020
another potential candidates
emerged in the media.

224
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,830
US authorities raided the home of
an Australian man named Dr. Craig,

225
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:46,831
right in 2016 rise agreed to do multiple
press interviews claiming that he was

226
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:50,620
the real Satoshi Nakamoto.
When he gave his evidence to journalists,

227
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:54,490
they were satisfied not knowing that he
had pulled the equivalent of a technical

228
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,520
parlor trick. Some people will
believe, some people weren't.

229
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,340
And to tell you the truth,
I don't really care.

230
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,480
Most people don't know how easy it is to
fake this kind of proof on blockchain.

231
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:08,700
So it has been published in multiple
venues that here's the real Sitoshi

232
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,710
Nakamoto. But after seeing the likes of
the BBC and the economist of vouching,

233
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:12,040
Fen,

234
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,030
many people in the colors of Satoshi began
to believe that their messiah had for

235
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:20,440
a tans and he was back to
tell them exactly what to
do with that money during a

236
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,161
public interview.

237
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,760
Boy Genius Vitalik Buterin gave a number
of examples of our Craig Wrights could

238
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:29,140
have faked this so-called proof and gave
examples of how he should have proven

239
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,860
that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto,
but he had failed to do so.

240
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,780
Boozer and sandy signaling theory.

241
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,350
It says that if you have a good way to
prove something and do you have a noisy

242
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,184
way to do it,

243
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,850
then the reason why you picked the noisy
way was because you couldn't do the

244
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,750
good way in the first place.
Craig Rice is in fact profiting office,

245
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,100
sudden claim to fame.

246
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,850
He is an outspoken to shame and appearing
before crowds making promises about a

247
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,500
bitcoin's future.
In reality,

248
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,860
he has started his own company and to
the promises he makes her actually not

249
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,230
that impressive where
the tech is concerned.

250
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,280
He made millions of dollars from investors
simply by claiming that he is the

251
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:07,570
real protection Akron Moto in many ways.
He seems to be bike the wizard of Oz,

252
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,670
but many have not been fooled.

253
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,620
In February of 2018 Craig rice with
sued for stealing $10 billion of crypto

254
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:18,340
currency assets from his former business
fondness. The lawsuit is still ongoing,

255
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,190
so at the time we're making this video,
we can't be sure of the outcome.

256
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,150
The journalist named Andrew O'hagan has
done a very deep dive into the Craig

257
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:29,080
right case and here's discovered that
Rice also lost a lot of money in the past

258
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:33,350
from a cryptocurrency farm called Liberty
Reserve in Costa Rica. Right? Awesome.

259
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,340
At face to face with Ross
Ulbricht soon before his arrest.

260
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,790
So why on earth would this millionaire
businessman be associating with a drug

261
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,820
dealer from the Silk Road? Some
people theorize that, right?

262
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,590
Isn't Satoshi Nakamoto at all,

263
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:48,190
and he may actually be the
true dread pirate Roberts.

264
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,320
There are dozens of theories of who at
Satoshi Nakamoto truly is from Elon Musk

265
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,600
to the NSA. One of them asks,
former ends ends at Space X.

266
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,890
Sahil Gupta wrote a comprehensive blog
post on medium as to why he believed that

267
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,470
his former boss was the
real Satoshi Nakamoto.

268
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,490
This caused such a stir that Elon Musk
and to tweets that he was not the founder

269
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,350
of Bitcoin.
Everyone of course,

270
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:19,310
has a very passionate reason for believing
that their theory is the correct one,

271
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,270
whoever he is, we may never have seen
Satoshi Nakamoto in the news at all,

272
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,650
even under another name.

273
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,070
It's very possible that he knew better
than to put himself in the limelight and

274
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,940
it would be impossible to gases identity.
Effie kept in the shadows,

275
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,390
but it's the Toshi neck and moto is
still alive and his, if he is true leaf,

276
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:37,460
just one man or even a group of people,

277
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,690
why haven't they touched those billions
of dollars that are sitting in that big

278
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,533
coin wallet?

279
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,090
Is there really a person on this planet
with the willpower to resist that kind

280
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:51,320
of temptation and what does he think
about the corrupt system that bitcoin has

281
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:55,910
become? In 2012 Satoshi Nakamoto wrote
in an email to one of the original core

282
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,680
developers of Bitcoin by hand.

283
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:01,850
That ripple is interesting in that
it's the only other system that does

284
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:05,840
something with trust beside
concentrated into a central server.

285
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,070
While she is basically saying is that
it's the only other coin he considered a

286
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:14,660
real contender and admits that it's truly
an improvement on bitcoin and his last

287
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:14,901
email,

288
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:18,680
he also rode the dude given up on bitcoin
and wanted to work on another project

289
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:22,520
without giving any details as to
what that new project actually was.

290
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,240
And this leads us to our final theory.

00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,400
who is now the lead cryptographer ripple.

292
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,600
In 1988 Shults filed two patents have
a distributive computing network before

293
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,300
the existence of the Internet.
And in lots of ways his idea,

294
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,950
it was almost identical to bitcoin.

295
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,890
20 years before Sitoshi
Nakamoto appeared on the scene.

296
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,010
Shorts is no stranger to
using alias as either,

297
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:46,130
and he went by the pseudonym Joel
counts online for many years.

298
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,910
There is no denying that
he was intelligent enough
to come up with this on his

299
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,440
own. Shorts is used his
knowledge to turn the rep,

300
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:56,780
the ecosystem into a product that is far
more sustainable than bitcoin ever was.

301
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,160
It doesn't need to be mined.

302
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,960
That transactions are settled within
a few seconds in each transfer costs a

303
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,230
fraction of a penny banks around the
world already beginning to use the ripple

304
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:10,610
network because it's the only one that's
even remotely possible to use in the

305
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:14,570
real world. David Schwartz has an
estimated net worth of $90 million.

306
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,020
If ripple succeeds as much as many
believe it will and he may become a

307
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,670
billionaire at some point in the future.

308
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,120
This would serve as a rational explanation
as to why he hasn't touched the

309
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:26,960
fortune in bitcoin is because he doesn't
want the possibility that it may lead

310
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:31,400
back to him and he became so rich with
ripple that he doesn't actually need it

311
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,730
when presented with this theory.
David Schwartz denies it of course,

312
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:38,780
but that's probably what the
real sitoshi would totally say.

313
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,930
So I really hope you found their video
interesting and it was a little different

314
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:45,950
from our normal video is here with us not
really knowing anything about the man,

315
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,930
but they have it.
I do hope you enjoyed it.

316
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:50,970
