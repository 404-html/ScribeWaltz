1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,800
What if I told you that the world's
first computer program that was born over

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,060
200 years ago, and what if that
programmer was a sheep lady?

3
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:12,830
Ava Lovelace was her name. Man's a genius
was nearly lost. The history daughters,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,620
the famous romantic poet,
Lord Byron Ada,

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,390
was almost relegated as a footnote
and her father's biography in the 19th

6
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:23,540
century. At the height of
the industrial revolution,

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,010
she was pushed into the male dominion
of mathematics and science by her zealot

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,010
mother medsource by the
father of the computer.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,630
She emerged as a woman far ahead of her
time and her ability to see what could

10
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:38,600
potentially be not as your
typical aristocratic lady.

11
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:42,860
Part of [inaudible] story holds a
shadowy secret and on her deathbed,

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,610
her last wish speaks volumes.
Today on biographics,

13
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:50,270
we explore the enchantress
of number Ada Lovelace.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,153
Okay.

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,710
Ada Lovelace was born or Gusta eight a
Byron in London on December the 10th 1815

16
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,630
to the philandering romantic poet,
Lord Byron,

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,780
and strictly religious Annabella Milbanke
Eto was Lord Byron's only legitimate

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,200
child. Lord and Lady Byron were
members of high British society,

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,490
the social status,
and they shed virtually nothing in common.

20
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,660
Annabella was analytical and it's
conformist. While Lord Byron the cat,

21
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,160
little for numbers and logic, true. He
was a celebrated and the door poets,

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,000
yet it's bad behavior raised
more than a few eyebrows.

23
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,770
He was known to drink from a human
skull owner pat to bear and to engage in

24
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,560
numerous love affairs
with both men and women.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,970
One notorious scans are involved in
the fat with his own half sister.

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,150
Let's go on to lover one set
of Lord Byron. He was mad,

27
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,040
bad and dangerous to know and not
surprisingly Annabella and Lord Byron's

28
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:06,041
marriage did not last beyond a year and
a contemptuous splits when Ada was only

29
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:09,230
five weeks old. Lord Byron
left the home. He wrote her.

30
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,500
This parting is my face like my mother's,

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,590
my Fairchild Ada sole daughter
of my house and Heart,

32
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,150
deeply bitter and resentful.

33
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:21,710
Lady Annabella covered his portrait with
a large curtain and four bead Ada from

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,550
ever looking at it for months after
Lord Byron left his infant daughter.

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,380
He left England for good, never to
return when Ada was eight years old,

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
speed died of an illness in Greece while
fighting in the war of independence.

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,140
He was 36 years old,
although I never met her father.

38
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,340
She remained fascinated with him and
just poetry over the course of her life.

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,110
Out of the was determined to steer
her daughter away from developing her

40
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:48,230
father's volatile at poetic
and sanity as she called us.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,440
She truly believed Lord Byron was
mentally ill almost to the brink of

42
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,830
fanaticism.

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Annabella saw to it that Ada received
an education rigorous and and science.

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,140
This was a rather unusual course of study
for girls in British Victorian society.

45
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,020
Even if Annabella herself
was gifted in math,

46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,370
but I referred to her as the
princess of parallelograms.

47
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,060
Popular opinion of the time favored
one of adas later tutors and brilliant

48
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:20,680
mathematician or Gustus
Morgan who believed women
wearing capable of excelling

49
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,550
in the discipline. On the one hand,
Morgan acknowledged a disabilities. Yeah,

50
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:28,360
it's in a letter to her mother. He wrote
the very great tension of the minds,

51
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,110
which they require as beyond the
strength of a woman's physical power of

52
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,944
application.

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,220
Basically what he said was that women
weren't capable because they were not as

54
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:40,150
strong as men. Well, [inaudible],
she was going to prove that wrong.

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,250
As a young girl and into our teen years,

56
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,060
eight it was mostly isolators and did
not spend a great deal of time with our

57
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:46,750
mother.

58
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,640
Still Annabella was committed to her
daughter's education until wellbeing.

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,410
She employed some of the greatest
intellectual minds to tutor Ada,

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,640
including William King, physician,
William Friends, a social reformer,

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,210
and Mary Somerville, a Scottish
astronomer, mathematician,

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,720
and the first woman to be admitted
to the Royal Astronomical Society.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,520
Eight or in Somerville became
close friends. In addition
to Algebra and geometry,

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,330
Ada was taught lessons in
history, literature, languages,
geography, music, sewing.

65
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm shorthands.
These were all common subject areas,

66
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,710
but it mother pound something else.
That was far,

67
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:27,970
far more bizarre in an effort to
protect her daughter from developing her

68
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,260
father's impulses. Ada had to lie
still for long periods of time.

69
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,700
This was a lesson in self control and
it was a bright students and showed

70
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,540
promise from math and science. At the
age of 12 after a long tour of Europe,

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,540
she became obsessed with
birds and with flight.

72
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,800
She researched what she referred to you
as fly ology man's imaginatively and

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,730
methodically. You conceptualize the
flying machine that could flap it's wings.

74
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,660
She rides where mother,

75
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,370
I've got a scheme to make a thing in the
form of a horse with a steam engine in

76
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,120
the inside,

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,620
so contrived as to move an immense pair
of wings fixed on the outside of the

78
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:06,820
horse in such a manner to carry it up
into the air while a person sits on its

79
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,020
back. For her design, she considered the
type of material, paper, silk or feathers,

80
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,970
navigational equipment or compass and
steam the source of power in between

81
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:20,080
throwing herself into intellectual
pursuits, eight of battles, sickness.

82
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,560
She frequently, it complains of
headaches that obscured her vision.

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,450
In 1829 she contracted measles or common
childhood affliction in the 18 hundreds

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,650
the illness resulted in continuous bed
rest for a year and she was disabled

85
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,513
temporarily.

86
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,750
In 1831 at the age of 16 she was finally
able to walk again with the aid of

87
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,920
crutches by the age of 17 eight is
feeling better and in keeping with the

88
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,420
customs of our social class.

89
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,220
She was presented at court and it became
a popular bell of the season she danced

90
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:52,030
with and charms the various
attendees with her brilliant mind.

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,380
The industrial revolution was in full
force by the time Ed was a teenager.

92
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,130
It was a glorious time in history for
the advancement of technology and the

93
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:14,300
perfect time for the inquisitive Ada
to be coming of age. Make no mistake.

94
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,160
She had the makings of a phenom.

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,310
She had inherent abilities
combined with rigorous education.

96
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,350
She also had access to intellects,

97
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,380
investors and influential people empower
all because of her position in society.

98
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,620
All of this was the perfect storm and
meeting the famed inventive Charles

99
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,030
Babbage was eight as a lightening bolts
in 1833 of the 17 year old Dado was

100
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:39,650
among a select group to attend a coveted
party hosted by Babbage known by many

101
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:44,210
today has the father of the computer I
guest wrote at the time one of the three

102
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:47,090
qualifications for those who sought
to be invited where intellects,

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,120
beauty or rank Ada with those requirements
while she fit right in at the soiree,

104
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,070
Babbage unveiled a small
part of his latest machine,

105
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,970
a massive mechanical calculator
known as the difference engine.

106
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,710
The design for Babbage's engine was
revolutionary and it's fully constructed.

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,280
It was perform the work of an
army of men crunching numbers.

108
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,390
The machine would be powered by steam
and would methodically perform complex

109
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:16,310
calculations using only
edition by breaking it into
smaller and smaller pieces

110
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,890
known as the method of finite differences,

111
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,290
then is which printouts that
you values into a table.

112
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,790
Babbage's machine had enormous potential
in the 19th century since tables were

113
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,780
used in many areas, including
navigation, astronomy, and engineering.

114
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,380
With this powerful calculator.
Human error would be erased.

115
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,000
The engine was accurate within 31
decimal places so many guests that night.

116
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,070
Babbage's invention was a hunk of metal
and less or more than a party favor but

117
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,760
not to ada to Morgan's wife was there
and later wrote of the night when most of

118
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:50,930
the guests looked on with the expression
that savages show on seeing a looking

119
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,730
glass.
Miss Byron youngest,

120
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:56,750
she was understood it's working and
saw the great beauty of the invention.

121
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,410
Babbage must have been impressed with
eight as intellect and enthusiasm for the

122
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:05,240
machine from that night on. He remains
her mentor and Lifelong friends.

123
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,980
Babbage's difference engine would not
come to be after a disagreement with his

124
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,980
engineer, Joseph Clemens.
In those days by law,

125
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,710
the engineer owns the drawings
and after they're falling out,

126
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,870
he could not get them back.
Consequently,

127
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,780
the British government also withdrew
their funding for the projects.

128
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,150
This forced manage back
to his original concept,

129
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,180
but he came up with an even better idea
in 1834 a far more complex machine that

130
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,320
he called the analytical engine.

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,850
The analytical engine is considered to
be the world's very first programmable

132
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
general purpose computer.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,830
The basic structure of the engine is
essentially the same as modern day

134
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:52,550
computers. Of course, Babbage's
machine was massive in scale.

135
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,580
His entry level machines would have
been 40 feet long by 15 feet high,

136
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,080
but he's talked about others
that were 10 times that size,

137
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,400
nothing like this had ever been
conceived or attempted before. In fact,

138
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,190
in his lifetime,
only a small trial engine was constructed.

139
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,520
This analytical engine, it consisted
of four components, the mill,

140
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,840
which calculated units,

141
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,190
the store where the data was held for
processing as the reader and printer,

142
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,110
the input and output devices.

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,130
It was truly groundbreaking and
would largely become adas legacy.

144
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,880
Since eight or in Babbage's first meeting,
she became his protege.

145
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,250
He was the teacher and she was the pupil.

146
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,710
After Babbage showed or the
plans for the analytical engine,

147
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:35,460
she eagerly went on a tour of cotton
mills in the north of England to see the

148
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,770
most technologically
advanced machine of the day.

149
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,430
The Jacquard loom the limb automated.

150
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:44,310
It's the weaving of patterned silk and
it was controlled by a series of punch

151
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:47,430
cards. It was fascinating and
it was also controversial.

152
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,540
The cotton mill with a jacquard loom
didn't need skilled workers to weave

153
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,150
intricate patterns while
groups such as the blood,

154
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:58,200
I'd swear protesting against
these machines on account
of replacing workers jobs.

155
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,290
Ada was thinking something else entirely.

156
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,490
She was deeply interested in the genius
behind the punch cards and wanted to

157
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:09,690
know how men were translating
the complicated patterns
into something simple.

158
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,980
She saw the similarities.

159
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,730
Do you have a loved and machine and
later wrote the analytical engine weaves

160
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,910
Algebraic patterns.

161
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Just as the Chicago loom weaves flowers
and leaves for the next 10 years in

162
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,550
between getting married
and having three children,

163
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,930
eight have focused all her energy into
learning everything she could about the

164
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,730
analytical engine she wrote.

165
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,990
I think I am more determined than ever
in my future plans and I have quite made

166
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,230
up. My mind's that nothing must be
suffered to interfere with them.

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,810
I intend to make such
arrangements in town as well,

168
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:43,950
secure me a couple of hours daily with
very few exceptions. For my studies.

169
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,380
After attending one of
Babbage's rare lectures,

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,810
a military engineer in future
Italian prime minister,

171
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,070
Luigi man of Breyer wrote an impressive
article sketcher of the analytical

172
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:55,200
engine invented by Charles Babbage Squire.

173
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,770
The paper was extremely detailed and
mathematical and there was also written in

174
00:10:58,771 --> 00:10:59,460
French.

175
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,120
Ada decided to translate the paper and
since she knew the engines so well she

176
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,220
could add her own thoughts
to us any years later.

177
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:09,240
Babbage claim to have told
data to translate it and
write her own accounts and

178
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:12,090
she responded by saying she
hadn't thought of it either way,

179
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,410
she went about the task like a devil
possessed and when she was finished her

180
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,710
notes with three times as long as the
original paper eight or published or

181
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:23,910
completed article in scientific memoirs
and English Scientific Journal published

182
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:28,170
by Richard Taylor in 1843 a. Dot.
Only used her initials on the paper.

183
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,200
Aal Standing for Augusta,
Ada Lovelace.

184
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,500
The parts of the paper that gives wait
ages creditors first computer programmer

185
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,060
comes in section g and it's eight a
wrote of how the engine could be programs

186
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:42,120
with a code to calculate
Bernoulli numbers.

187
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,320
This was an algorithm to be carried out
by a machine and thus the first computer

188
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:50,220
program along with numbers eight Ada
describes how codes could be created for

189
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:53,130
the device so it could
handle letters and symbols.

190
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,700
She also theorized a method for the engine
to repeat a series of instructions or

191
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,580
looping a process.
Computer programs still used today.

192
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,270
Hey are also offered other other concepts
in her paper such as her thoughts on

193
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,100
artificial intelligence.
She wrote,

194
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,940
the analytical engine has no pretentions
want to have to originate anything.

195
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,520
It can do whatever.
We know how to order it to perform.

196
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,810
It can follow analysis but it has no
power of anticipating any analytical

197
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,460
relations or truths.

198
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,720
Her notes worked significance and that
they captured aiders vision for the

199
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:27,370
analytical engine and this is where she
exceeds her mentor and her understanding

200
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,450
of its full potential.

201
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,080
Babbage's historian wrote eight or saw
something that Babbage in some sense fail

202
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,790
to see in Babbage's weld his engines.
We're bound by number.

203
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,830
What lovely saw was that number could
represent entities other than quantity.

204
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,800
Looking back from the present
high ground of modern computing.

205
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,980
If we are looking and sifting
history for that transition,

206
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,220
then that transition was
made explicitly by Ada.

207
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,540
In that 1843 paper.
Babbage was impressed with Ada and wrote,

208
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,950
the more I read your notes,

209
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:00,250
the more surprised I am Andrew guys
and not having earlier explored.

210
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:02,740
So richer vein of the noblest metal.

211
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,250
The next obvious step for the analytical
engine would have been Babbage's and

212
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,280
adas crowning moments,
but it would not come to pass.

213
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,730
Babbage was known to be a difficult
man and he argued with politicians,

214
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,600
so for his machines, the relationship
with parliaments was particularly salad.

215
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,990
After Babbage fail to deliver his
government funded difference engine,

216
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,610
the loss of money in those days was the
equivalent to two Royal Navy warships.

217
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Ada had a plan to promote the engine,
but it was a sensitive subjects.

218
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,860
One she breached in a letter dated August
the 14th 1843 she asked about Ej if

219
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:36,580
she could take over him for promoting
the analytical engine while he stepped

220
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,680
aside and focus only on building it.

221
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,710
She ended up with you will
won them over this last query,

222
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,700
but I strongly advise you not to
reject us. Vantage though he said no,

223
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,300
refusing all of her conditions that
interest would not give up control and he

224
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:51,790
likely saw her asking
as an audacious move.

225
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,013
Okay.

226
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,850
Depending on the lens you use to evaluate
data, she can be hailed as a genius,

227
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:10,330
say Victorian High Society Lady,
a mother and wife, a Gambler,

228
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:14,140
adulterous or drug addicts and truth.
She may have been all of those things.

229
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,170
She was like most of us complex and
contradictory as one would expect a to

230
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,910
married and had children.
She went William King,

231
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:26,911
not William King who was a tutor in 1835
at the age of 19 he was 30 king seem to

232
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:31,330
be a precise, conscientious and
decent man if somewhat stiff.

233
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,420
Three years after they tied the knots,
king became the Earl of Lovelace.

234
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,560
Ada took the title account
tests of Lovelace. They had
three children together.

235
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:43,590
Byron born may of 1836 and Isabella
called Annabella born in September of 1837

236
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,500
and Ralph Gordon born in July of 1839
four at a time between 1835 and 1839 eight

237
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,520
or focused most of our energy
running the large households.

238
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,950
She found herself time for horse riding,

239
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,510
learning the harp and studying mathematics
after their third child was born,

240
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,140
eight or 10 tev retention back to
maths and the sciences and was Tuesday.

241
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,680
It's by Augustus to Morgan and her
husband. King were supportive socially.

242
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,670
The couple had many prominent friends
and acquaintances including the writer

243
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,750
Charles Dickens.

244
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,870
In addition to you headaches and since
the measles suffered in childhood,

245
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,690
Ada had recurrent health
problems as an adult.

246
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,130
After about of color in 1837 she had
problems with asthma and her digestive

247
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,580
system. She was prescribed a powerfully
addictive painkiller and opiates,

248
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,260
which was to be taken with wine.

249
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,760
The drug altered her personality and she
reported hallucinations and mood swings.

250
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,540
In 1841 ada and Maduro relieve the
daughter of Lord Byron's half sister or

251
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,660
Gustus Lee were told why Adas mother,

252
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,980
that Lord Byron was also Madora his father
in February eight a road to another.

253
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,470
I am not in the least astonished.
In fact,

254
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:49,940
you merely confirm what I have for years
and years, felt scarcely a doubt about,

255
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,410
but should have considered it in proper
in me to hinted to you that I in any way

256
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,340
suspect it. She did not blame the
incestuous relationship on her father,

257
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,620
but instead blamed or Gusta Lee.

258
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,460
I fear she is more inherently wicked
than he ever was in the 1840 [inaudible]

259
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,110
has self flirted with scandals first
with relaxed relationships with men who

260
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,880
went. Also husbands, which led to rumors.

261
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:15,390
She was having affairs and then an
old family vice surfaced. Haters.

262
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,730
Life took a shadowy turn in 1851
when she began gambling on horses.

263
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,990
Perhaps she was trying in vain to raise
funds for her beloved analytical engine,

264
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,620
but no one really knows. Hey
Deb, she did not act alone.

265
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,170
She was part of a gambling
ring and in the spring season,

266
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,020
hot bats went horribly wrong.
It has been said,

267
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,210
I ate a may have devised
a mathematical scheme.

268
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,170
Do you predict the winning horses? If
so, though it didn't work in a fails,

269
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:44,171
battered the EPSOM Debbie Ada ended up
owing the equivalent of roughly half a

270
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,770
million pounds to get out of her dad.

271
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,120
She pawned off some of the family jewels
in 1852 80 became gravely ill man.

272
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,940
She took to her bed.
She died painfully and slowly.

273
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,020
A future in cancer on November the 27th
1852 at the age of 36 the exact age her

274
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,310
father had been a few
months before she died.

275
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,700
She made an unknown confession to our
husbands that made him leave her bad side,

276
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,610
her final wish. Where's an act
of defiance against her mother.

277
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,300
Ada wants to be buried next to the
man who loomed large in her life,

278
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,630
but she never knew her father age.

279
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:17,480
His body was taken miles away from our
home to the buyer and family volts inside

280
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:21,050
the Church and sit and Mary Magdalene and
the small English town of [inaudible].

281
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,823
Yeah,

282
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,250
that's brain of mine is something
more than merely mortal.

283
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,370
As time will show eight his
contributions were buried for 100 years,

284
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,120
discovered by a scientist,

285
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:45,320
Alan Turing in the 1940s during the second
world war during with something of a

286
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:48,350
kindred spirit who was also
interested in the same things.

287
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,330
She was machines that
could act upon instruction.

288
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,750
His work ultimately led to the effort
to build a machine with the code name,

289
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,330
the bomb that deciphered
encrypted messages sent by hit.

290
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,160
This armed forces tierings work had begun
before reading eight his notes on the

291
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:06,510
analytical engine, yet he was
greatly influenced by them.
She, along with Babbage,

292
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,620
essentially paved the way for tiering
who is considered today as the father of

293
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:14,550
theoretical computer science and
artificial intelligence. Consequently,

294
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,080
as notes surfaced for the weld and BV
Bowden's Book Faster Than Thought a

295
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:24,081
symposium on digital computing machines
from 1953 then during the 1970s in the u

296
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:29,250
s department of Defense develops a high
order computer programming language to

297
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,030
supersede the hundreds of different
ones then in use by the military.

298
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,160
This programming language was named Ada.

299
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,300
They is still used around the world today
and the operation of real time systems

300
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,610
in the aviation health care,
transportation,

301
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:45,450
financial infrastructure and space
industries in the present day in

302
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,140
international celebration takes place
on the second Tuesday of October.

303
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,730
That would be Ada Lovelace day founded
in 2009 by sue Sharmane Anderson.

304
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,540
It's aim is to recognize the achievements
of women in science, technology,

305
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,980
engineering and maths.

306
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,340
It also has the goal of increasing the
profile of women in these areas and in

307
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,030
doing so,

308
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,080
creating new role models who will
encourage more girls into these sectors.

309
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,330
Ada is everywhere in our
modern digital wells,

310
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,410
immortalized on the internet forever
in news articles, blog posts, memes,

311
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,460
quotable quotes.

312
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,320
There's even some controversy of whether
or not she deserves the claim of first

313
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,280
computer programmer,

314
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,540
but there is no denying her
vision surpassed any of her
contemporaries including

315
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,110
Babbage in all his 11 volumes of
published writings he never wrote of the

316
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:30,870
aspirations for computing like Ada has,

317
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,950
those who have learned to walk on the
threshold of unknown worlds by means of

318
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:37,380
what's are commonly termed par excellence.

319
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,820
The exact sciences may then with
the fairways, wings of imagination,

320
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,050
hope to saw further into the
unexplored mist which we live.

321
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,590
So I really hope you enjoyed that
episode of biographics. If you did this,
