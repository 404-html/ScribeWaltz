1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,270
Honest hemingway was a man's man.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,290
He was a war hero,

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,570
a big game hunter from
an adventure and bands,

4
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:05,941
a bubble.

5
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:07,460
Laos a storyteller,

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,690
yet his was a leaf.

7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,280
It fills with contrasts.

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,390
During his early years,

9
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:12,224
the future match.

10
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,900
Mom's mother dressed and
treated him as a girl,

11
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,830
met his own son.

12
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,290
Gregory would become made transvestite.

13
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,910
He was also known as Papa Hemingway,

14
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:23,000
but he had a distant relationship
with his own three sons.

15
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,600
In the midst of the glowing tributes
that the world heaped upon him,

16
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,190
he sunk two terrible lows causing
turmoil as he racked up awards.

17
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,480
And then finally,

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,130
in an act of desperation,

19
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,600
he took his own life.

20
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,530
Does say that Hemingway,

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,120
it was a complex individual,

22
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,250
is perhaps the ultimate understatement.

23
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,200
And in today's biographics video,

24
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:47,201
we're going to do our best to discover
the real man behind the veneer of Papa

25
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,253
Hemingway.

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,260
Hmm.

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,830
Honest Miller Hemingway
was born on July 1st,

28
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,150
1899 at two eds and grace.

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,840
Hemingway.

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Ed was a doctor in the
Chicago suburb of Oak Park.

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,100
Grace was he talented opera singer who
had been forced to give up a province in

32
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:24,550
Korea.

33
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,690
Do you deport her eyesight?

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,250
She was to replace the adulation she could
have received by being a star with an

35
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,530
abnormal obsession with her children.

36
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,270
For the first six years of his life,

37
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,900
young Ernie was dressed and
treated as a girl by his mother.

38
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,700
She had always wanted twin girls and
made her son play that role to his older

39
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:46,701
sister Masalin as if FTU counter the
feminizing influences of his wife Ed.

40
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,010
He was a keen outdoorsman,

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,270
would take his son camping alongside
Lake Michigan for two months every year.

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,840
The honest was allowed to dress as a boy.

43
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,450
Ends was introduced to do the
manly arts of hunting and fishing.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,490
Having where he though he remembered
his father is a cruel man edge.

45
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,100
It was often harsh to as children.

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,220
If they misbehaved after
whipping them with a razor strap,

47
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,590
he would make them pray
to God for forgiveness.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,490
The Sun that developed a deep hatred
for his father or eating that he would

49
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:14,350
sometimes go into the shed shoulder,

50
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:17,710
his father's hunting rifle and
line up the old man in his sights.

51
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,280
Still,

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,460
he was able to restrain himself
from pulling that trigger.

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,760
Now in high school and his strive
to be the center of attention.

54
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,750
He was popular with his classmates
throwing himself into every game,

55
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:29,830
activity or prank.

56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,370
Yet,

57
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,750
despite his enthusiasm,

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,490
he was not a very good sportsman,

59
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,960
still wanting to impress.

60
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:38,440
He would make up stories about his prowess
on the football fields and took these

61
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,400
friends and family.

62
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,810
It was in the creation of these tall tales
that Ernest Hemingway was to discover

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,640
his true gift as a writer.

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,080
It was Hemingway's English teacher that
noticed his talents with the pen and

65
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,680
encouraged the boys to try
out for the school newspaper.

66
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,180
He wanted a place on the writing team
and we seem to publish his first story.

67
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,080
The theme of that story would resonate
with Hemingway for the rest of his life.

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,120
Coming to a tragic conclusion,

69
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,350
45 years later,

70
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,250
the short story,

71
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,180
it was cool to a judgement at [inaudible]
and it was about a hunter who ends his

72
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,320
life in a suicide.

73
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,620
The story it was well
received and Hemingway was
spurred on to pursue a career

74
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,700
in journalism against the wishes of his
father who fully intended to become a

75
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,420
doctor.

76
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,290
The boy's uncle.

77
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,420
He was the friends of a tennis
shoe at the Kansas City.

78
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,390
Star arranged an apprenticeship
as a cub reporter.

79
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,570
This 17 year old wants
to handle the crime beat.

80
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,630
Hemingway absolutely threw
himself into this job.

81
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,430
The first task was to
devour the stars style book,

82
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:43,510
which was based upon their
unique abbreviated pro style.

83
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,980
It demands it the use of short sentences
and introductory paragraphs along with

84
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,890
simple language with an
emphasis on vigorous English.

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,060
I think we would recall that this was
the best writing advice that did it ever

86
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,894
received.

87
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,670
The entry of the United States into
the first world war in 1917 was a major

88
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,350
turning point in Hemingway's life.

89
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,130
The patriotic fervor that was sweeping
the nation's youth coupled with his in

90
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,810
his enthusiasm for adventure,

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,860
swept him up as he tried to join the
army rejected because he had defective

92
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,280
vision.

93
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,270
He tried it again this time applying to
the Red Cross ambulance division in SLE

94
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,050
before in us.

95
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,410
Well,

96
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,810
he was on a ship to Europe.

97
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,463
Hmm.

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,140
Who is it easily?

99
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,490
There's Hemingway was to get his first
experience of the madly comradery and

100
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:41,030
freedom.

101
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,770
That was to mean so much to him.

102
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,150
He was able to drink,

103
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,320
gambled Ben's corrals into the
early hours with absolute impunity.

104
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:48,950
Yes.

105
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,480
What do you really longs for?

106
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,300
That was combat far away
from the front lines.

107
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,580
His days were mainly spends in monotonous,

108
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:56,660
dreary tasks.

109
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,280
He confided to her friends.

110
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,300
I'm fed up,

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,270
there's nothing here that
scenery and too damn much of us.

112
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,380
I'm going to get out of this ambulance
section and see if I can't find out where

113
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:07,280
this war is.

114
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,480
Pretty soon the wall,

115
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:08,930
well,

116
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,400
it came to him on July the eighth 1918
he was delivering chocolate rations and

117
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:16,070
cigarettes to Italian
soldiers on the PA river.

118
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,460
He got caught in the middle of a German
offensive from the other side of the

119
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:20,170
water.

120
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,110
A bomb exploded,

121
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,670
throwing Hemingway to the ground.

122
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,500
The soldier alongside him was killed,

123
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,350
but honest escaped with
shrapnel wounds to his leg.

124
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,041
Despite this,

125
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,490
he managed to carry a wounded soldier
to safety before collapsing into

126
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:32,760
unconsciousness the way.

127
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,090
Well,

128
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,920
he now became a patient at the Red Cross
hospital in Milan and it was in this

129
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,250
hospital where he found his
first glove lying in bed.

130
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,350
He became captivated with an American
volunteer nurse by the name of agonist,

131
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,920
savant neuroscape during
his month recuperation and
it's an agonist explored the

132
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,030
sites of Milan together,

133
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,810
I think weight.

134
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,080
He became a numbered with a dark haired
beauty who was seven years his senior

135
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,891
huffy things.

136
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:55,341
However,

137
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:58,010
they were not so strong
despite to marry him.

138
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:59,690
At the war's end on New Year's Eve,

139
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,980
1918 having way it was discharged from
the Red Cross and returned to the family

140
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:04,850
home in Oak Park.

141
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,050
He took on the persona of a returning
war hero telling the local paper that he

142
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,560
was a soldier in the Italian army and
relating how we had been personally

143
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,900
decorated by the Italian king for bravery.

144
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,750
Something that totally never happens.

145
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,413
Okay.

146
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,590
Hemingway's postwar high,

147
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,680
it was shattered by a breakup
letter from agonists in it.

148
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,603
She wrote,

149
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,040
I am now and always will be too old,

150
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,460
and that's the truth as I can't get away
from the facts that you're just a boy.

151
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,593
A kid.

152
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,580
This through earnest into a tailspin,

153
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,700
he spends months loafing around
the house until it's fed up.

154
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,770
Mother finally tired
of just moping around,

155
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,520
threw him out,

156
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,940
grace while she gave him some
sounds and sobering advice.

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,140
Unless you my son,

158
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,320
earnest CCR,

159
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,250
lazy loafing or trading on
your handsome face to food,

160
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:57,000
gullible little girls and neglecting
your duty to God and your savior,

161
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:57,870
Jesus Christ.

162
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,700
Unless you come into your manhood,

163
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,490
there is nothing before
you but bankruptcy.

164
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,240
Whether this jolt of reality woke
him up or not is still uncertain,

165
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:10,860
but what we do know is that it was enough
to get earnest out of his funk and on

166
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:15,810
his way to Chicago there he wrote articles
for the Toronto Star and worked odd

167
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,970
jobs to support himself as a party.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,590
One night,

169
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,150
honest Matt,

170
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,660
a young woman by the name
of Hadley Richardson,

171
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,900
oddly was on a visit to the
big city from Saint Louis.

172
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,350
Having led a sheltered life under the
influence of a domineering mother?

173
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,890
Yes,

174
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,310
she had Ernest hit it off immediately
and despite the fact that she was eight

175
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:34,170
years older than him seems young army.

176
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,340
How do you think for older women,

177
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,500
the relationship blossomed?

178
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,553
Nine months later,

179
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,450
earnest and Hadley,

180
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,313
they were married,

181
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,540
I guess down to the wedding was show would
Anderson and up and coming writer who

182
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,020
a friend it Anderson encouraged
the newlyweds to move to Paris.

183
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,920
He gave out us.

184
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,990
That is an introduction,

185
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,290
so you literary friends,

186
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,460
he resided on the left bank managing
it to secure a position as a foreign

187
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:58,350
correspondent for the Toronto Star.

188
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,280
Having weight took his bride and
departed for a new life in Europe.

189
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,673
Hmm.

190
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,570
I think,

191
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,900
wait.

192
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,190
He quickly inserted itself into the
litter recess on Paris's left bank.

193
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,170
The couple moved into a small flat,

194
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:25,040
which sat next to a poppy that dance
Saul Bass drawing on Hadley's trust funds

195
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,260
adding.

196
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,370
We also rented a room on the
top floor or they shatty hotel.

197
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:28,760
Yeah.

198
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,340
He spent his mornings
perfecting the craft of writing.

199
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,550
He told himself that all he needed to
do was write one true sentence bars for

200
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:37,424
understanding way.

201
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,110
Being a writer meant seeing,

202
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:39,711
tasting,

203
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,544
and doing.

204
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,590
He spent hours observing people in Paris.

205
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:46,580
Cafes chatted freely with strangers
and spent long hours drinking with this

206
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,170
writing buddies in Paris.

207
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,620
Hemingway,

208
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,090
he was to come under the guidance of
celebrated author and playwright Gertrude

209
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,120
Stein.

210
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,420
She helped him to Paris words down to the
essence of the idea and to perfect the

211
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:01,800
style for which he would ultimately
become famous in 1923 they're having ways

212
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,610
that they took a trip to Spain that
sparking a lifelong love affair with the

213
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,444
Spanish culture.

214
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,730
Then people honest also fell in love with
the national obsession of bullfighting

215
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,750
in Pamplona.

216
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,860
The took his six month pregnant wife to
watch the running of the Bulls while she

217
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,980
hit her eyes from the spectacle
of a husband was spousal
bounds by the power and

218
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,030
the passion of the events.

219
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,110
I think we would return to the running
of the Bulls in Pamplona in the coming

220
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,230
years,

221
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,960
bringing a succession of
literary friends with him.

222
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,013
Okay.

223
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,190
These excursions.

224
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,680
They forms the backdrop
to his first novel.

225
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,180
The Sun also rises through his association
with F Scott Fitzgerald having boys

226
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:49,780
work came to the notice of Charles
Scribner publishers who published the Sun

227
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:53,670
also rises in 1926 this was
Hemingway's real breakthrough.

228
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,830
You're proving to be
both a commercial bands.

229
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,890
The critical success.

230
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,400
It's actually a day in a new minimalistic
writing style for which the world was

231
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,270
more than ready.

232
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,080
However,

233
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,780
not everyone was so
impressed by this book.

234
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,060
His mother sent him this scathing notes.

235
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,530
Surely you have other words in your
vocabulary besides dam and bitch as having

236
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:12,850
ways to start elevators.

237
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,220
His private life began to disintegrate.

238
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,690
He had frequent fallings out with his
or pals as he assumed the role of master

239
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:20,890
to their apprenticeships.

240
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,903
His temper,

241
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,990
it was volcanic,

242
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,660
sometimes lead to fist fights and things.

243
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,590
Unfortunately,

244
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,640
they are no better at home and threw
himself into a passionate affair with a

245
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,070
friend of his wife by the
name of Pauline Pfeiffer.

246
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,010
Hadley feeling deeply
betrayed by both sides.

247
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,160
Gave her first 100 days to
decide who you wanted to be with.

248
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,280
He chose the more cosmopolitan
Pfeiffer walked out.

249
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,550
I mean,

250
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,383
it's wifey son.

251
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Okay.

252
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,180
Hemingway the also walked
out on Paris in Pauline,

253
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,590
who had made a second wife,

254
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,340
moved to the island of
Key West Florida here,

255
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:56,801
honest,

256
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,960
reinvented himself as
a deep sea fishermen,

257
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,430
integrating himself with a group of hard
working and hard drinking seafarers who

258
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:07,330
were a world away from the
gentle intellectuals that
had left behind in Paris.

259
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,643
Okay.

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,690
Fishermen Hemingway reveled in
the machismo of his new lifestyle.

261
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,500
During the day he fished along the Cuban
coast and at night he smuggled rum for

262
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:28,610
his local hangout with the
proceeds rolling in from
the sun also rises and does

263
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:29,241
next novel,

264
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:30,290
a farewell to arms.

265
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,670
He built his own boat,

266
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:35,210
calls the pillar and set about to
becoming the world's greatest deep sea

267
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:35,990
fishermen.

268
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,170
He proceeded to win every
fishing contest on the Atlantic.

269
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,730
When the locals became upset,

270
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,070
he told them that they
could win their trophy back,

271
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,210
but first they have to last three
rounds in a boxing ring with m and s.

272
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,760
Well,

273
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,593
nobody could,

274
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,970
but still during all of this time,

275
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,920
Hemingway's love it was writing.

276
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,770
He rose at 5:00 AM each day and it's
worked at his typewriter until midday.

277
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,890
During this time,

278
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,240
he would give his total
focus to the rest and worse.

279
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,330
Then after lunch,

280
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:03,430
he would throw himself into his
other life that have the hard living,

281
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,120
heavy drinking man of action.

282
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,463
Okay.

283
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,290
During the key west is instant.

284
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,470
Pauline has two children of their own.

285
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,100
Both of them putting Pauline through
marathon myriads of labor tabs.

286
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:20,491
Then well,

287
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,480
she proved to be a pretty terrible mother,

288
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,100
a woman who clearly did not like the
inconvenience of having children.

289
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,300
Hemingway himself.

290
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:27,451
Well,

291
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:28,920
he was also a lousy father.

292
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,400
He would have periods of intense interest
in his boys and then completely ignore

293
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,510
them for months at a time.

294
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,040
In 1933 having weight discovered a whole
new world of adventure when he set out

295
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,750
on a hunting safari in Africa,

296
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,280
he was mesmerized by the natural
beauty of the Serengeti plain justice.

297
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:45,510
He was getting into the hunt.

298
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,060
He was struck with a
terrible bout of dysentery.

299
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,530
He was flown to a hospital then Nairobi
to recover the plane that flew over the

300
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:53,430
majestic mountains.

301
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:58,260
Kilimanjaro providing the inspiration for
his most celebrated short story of the

302
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:02,640
it snows of Kilimanjaro after his recovery
having returned to the hunts where he

303
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:06,270
managed to bag buffalo out to low
pans and lions during all this time,

304
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:10,080
he was soaking up the atmosphere for
inclusion in the later works of fiction

305
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,190
back in key west.

306
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,410
Hemingway continued his
heart living lifestyle.

307
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,220
During the early thirties he began an
affair with an American woman who lived in

308
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:18,180
Havana honest,

309
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,730
would spend increasing amounts
of time with her in Cuba.

310
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,220
While this frustrated why I've
struggled to cope with the children.

311
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,990
Then in 1936 he began an affair with
Martha Gellhorn need journalist and writer

312
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,590
Gellhorn that had the same sense of
journalistic adventurous Hemingway.

313
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,330
And in 1937 they made the decision that
to cover the Spanish civil war together,

314
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,680
I think we arrived in Spain as a reporter
for the American newspaper Alliance.

315
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,250
However,

316
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,130
he seemed became involved in
a Dutch film production goals,

317
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:47,820
at least Spanish earth
when the screenwriter quit
need took on the duties for

318
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:48,300
himself.

319
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,021
After a few months,

320
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:50,130
seat returned to America,

321
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,570
showing the film in Hollywood and to
raising at $20,000 for the Spanish

322
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:55,380
Republicans.

323
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,250
His month in Spain provided the basis
for Hemingway's best selling novel about

324
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:03,420
the civil war for whom the bell tolls
those months while they also fueled the

325
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,520
flames of passion with Martha Gellhorn.

326
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,860
A short time after returning to key west,

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,491
he divorced.

328
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:09,410
Pauline said that tea.

329
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:10,380
Good Mary Martha.

330
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,050
In 1939 the newlyweds Steve moved to Cuba.

331
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,740
They settle into a beautiful villa on
the outskirts of Havana and he has a

332
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:20,040
couple of what to write to during the day
and to then explore the nice life that

333
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,030
Havana had to offer.

334
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,580
Cuba was also a sportsman's paradise,

335
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:24,401
allowing Hemingway,

336
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:27,330
do you indulge his great
passion for deep sea fishing,

337
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,840
having weight when he soon Matt and
aging Cuban fisherman by the name of

338
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,060
Gregorio Fuentes,

339
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,300
they became fishing buddies with Hemingway
basing the character of Santiago in

340
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,800
his Pulitzer Prize winning novel,

341
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:38,880
the old man and the sea,

342
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,420
a prominent Gregorio during the hurricane
season to Cuba that you Hemingway's,

343
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:44,190
they decided to live in Sun Valley,

344
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,160
Idaho.

345
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,480
Here.

346
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,200
Honesty was able to partake in the
hunting and fresh water fishing that he'd

347
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,640
done with his father as a boy.

348
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,090
During this time he became
close friends with stars.

349
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,070
Gary Cooper runs Marlene Dietrich.

350
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,650
He took on the life of something
of a celebrity himself.

351
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,371
Errol Flynn,

352
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,001
Jane Russell,

353
00:14:59,001 --> 00:14:59,990
and Ingrid Bergman,

354
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,540
regular visitors to Sun
Valley back in Cuba.

355
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,930
He would in stain the likes of Spencer
Tracy and the Duchess of Windsor at the

356
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,580
Floridita bar in Havana.

357
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,410
It was Hemingway himself,

358
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,690
who was the acknowledged star of Havana.

359
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,480
The locals think we're always
delighted to have it in their midst.

360
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,110
They were just as impressed with his
ability to drink anyone under the table

361
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,210
Bosley where with this literary fame.

362
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,511
Yes.

363
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,150
Even as his wild nights on the town in
Nevada became more decadent and then

364
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,331
weight.

365
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:27,170
It never strayed from his
disciplined writing regimen.

366
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,530
He continued to produce quality
work with religious zeal.

367
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,690
One true sentence at a time,

368
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,260
and it was during this time that
international accolades began at showering

369
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:40,640
Hemingway in response to for whom the
bells toll this was widely regarded as a

370
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,840
literary masterpiece.

371
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,681
Ernest Hemingway,

372
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,950
the writer was transforming
himself into Papa Hemingway,

373
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,200
the white whisker literary genius,

374
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,580
who was also the big,

375
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,810
loud and burly Alpha male.

376
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,230
When World War Two they organize it has
also created tensions in far off Havana.

377
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,800
Martha Gellhorn Hemingway protect career
ahead of her family and set off to

378
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,221
Europe.

379
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,210
There's a war correspondent
novel Hemingway.

380
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,710
It was furious telling everyone within
earshot or that he had a good mind to

381
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,600
follow after her and kick her ass.

382
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,220
Good.

383
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,290
Tell her she should either come
home or go to military school.

384
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,800
Meanwhile,

385
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,740
Martha was becoming politically
active in support of the allies.

386
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,280
She encouraged Hemingway to use
his influence to rally support.

387
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,390
He ignored her pleas,

388
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,960
but finally I left for London as a
correspondence for Colliers magazine.

389
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,630
He joins the ref on
bombing missions and Holly,

390
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,330
the fourth infantry across
Normandy in the week of the d day.

391
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:44,260
Invasion on returning from the water
to form that having where greatly

392
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:48,220
exaggerated the party played in defeating
the Germans just as he had done at the

393
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:49,480
end of World War One.

394
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,120
The military got word
of his claims and again,

395
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:53,410
looking further into them,

396
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,470
they discovered that Hemingway had
violated his status as a noncombatant

397
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,110
reporter bond many occasions,

398
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,240
and he was charged with numerous rule
violations when it came to his defense of

399
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:07,150
number of high ranking officer's testified
with one stating that Hemingway was

400
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,260
without question.

401
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,540
One of the most courageous
men I've ever known.

402
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,400
Fear is a stranger to him having weight.

403
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,440
He was cleared of all charges and later
awarded a Bronze Star for bravery as a

404
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:18,490
war correspondent.

405
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,873
Okay.

406
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:29,860
Oh,

407
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,460
was ends.

408
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,510
Martha left the marriage,

409
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,090
fed up with our husbands
shamanistic tendencies,

410
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,931
but Hemingway,

411
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:35,201
well,

412
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:37,150
he already had a replacement in the wings.

413
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,290
It was a fellow walker respondents
by the name of the Mary Welsch.

414
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,160
Mary would be by his side,

415
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,240
right until the end.

416
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,320
In the late 1940s Hemingway's excessive
drinking began taking a toll on his

417
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,180
physical and mental health for the time
the quality of his writing began to

418
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:51,720
suffer,

419
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,670
which was hugely frustrating for him.

420
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Finally after a trip to where to lead
during which he engaged in a passionate

421
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:01,290
affair with a gal in our twenties they
published across the river and into the

422
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:01,950
trees.

423
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,550
The critics,

424
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,310
they absolutely slammed it
and for the first time having,

425
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:07,530
we felt the sting of literary rejection,

426
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,720
the consensus as well as that the old man,

427
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,090
he no longer had the gift for having well.

428
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,520
This was like a red flag to a bull.

429
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,370
He completed his next
novel in just eight weeks.

430
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,510
That novel was the older man of the sea
and to became the defining work of his

431
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,230
career,

432
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,070
the aging champ,

433
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,230
he had regained his title
and with a vengeance,

434
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,940
silencing the critics and claiming Veem
1953 Pulitzer Prize for literature.

435
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,760
Then in 1954 Hemingway,

436
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,270
he was on safari in Africa.

437
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,310
When his light plane
went down in the jungle,

438
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,560
smashing his head against
the door to a furnace.

439
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,030
He saved the life of all onboard but
suffered permanent head injuries in the

440
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,290
wake of the Cuban revolution.

441
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,670
Hemingway's left Avanir in July
of 1960 and to move to Idaho here,

442
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,271
his health,

443
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,530
both mental and physical,

444
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,820
rapidly deteriorated.

445
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,900
He was admitted to the Mayo Clinic and
it's given electroshock therapy to treat

446
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:55,620
his depression.

447
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,281
This rob,

448
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:00,270
to the master wordsmith off his
greatest rating tool is memory.

449
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,500
And without that you have
nothing understanding why
he committed suicide with

450
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:08,160
his favorite hunting rifle on July 2nd,

451
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,440
1961 so I really hope
you found that video.
