1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,380
There's the group at the center of major
conspiracy theories have been accused

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:07,620
of pulling the strings of major
governments around the world for inserting

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:09,650
symbols into such prominent places.

4
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:13,740
As the US dollar bill and conspiracy
theorists have claims that everyone from

5
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:18,741
the Beatles to Tom Brady to Kanye West
are more recent members of the centuries

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,770
old society.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,630
There's no doubt the Illuminati have
impacted welder fast even if just by being

8
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,490
at the center of conspiracy theories.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,250
But where did this group get it start?

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,640
Well,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,220
let's take a look at the man
behind the secret society.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,690
Johann Adam.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,673
Why stopped

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,650
Johann Adam Weishaupt,

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,350
who was born into an academic
household in Bavaria.

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,300
He came into the world
on February the sixth,

17
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:49,811
17,

18
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:51,670
48 is the son of a law professor.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,800
When she was only five years old,

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,910
his father passed away,

21
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:57,130
leaving him to be raised
by his grandfather.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,180
Also a law professor,

23
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,750
Weiss helps grandfather kept caps,

24
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:01,960
the Boeing engaged in
scholastic activities.

25
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,410
His grandfather was a proponent of the
enlightenment movements and the thoughts

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,470
and philosophies promoted
by enlightenment thinkers,

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,850
came to greatly influence Weiss hops
during the 17th and 18th century.

28
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:13,830
Enlightenment movements.

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,250
Intellectuals emphasized the importance
of reason and individualism over

30
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:18,940
tradition.

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,320
You might also hear the enlightenment
referred to as the age of reason among the

32
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:26,860
movements most famous thinkers with
John Locke and Isaac Newton when he was

33
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:27,580
seven years old.

34
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,850
Ice Helps Education expanded
beyond his grandfather's teaching.

35
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,240
The family was Catholic and why sap
to began attending a jesuit school.

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,870
He was a voracious reader and
by the time he was 20 years old,

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,030
he has and his doctorate in law.

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,740
He began teaching law bars.

39
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:46,390
Within a year he became the beneficiary
of the dissolution of the very religious

40
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,040
order that had educated him.

41
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,490
Political maneuvering coupled
with cultural changes made.

42
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:55,480
The jesuits are a threat to the
power of some European leaders,

43
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,220
at least in their eyes.

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,790
The order was suppressed in several
countries and even the pope issued a brief

45
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,450
suppressing the jesuits because of
the order suppression in Seventeen,

46
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:09,451
73 wise helped was able to move from being
a professor of secular law to being a

47
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:13,600
professor of Canon law at the University
of English start before the suppression

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,200
only jesuits towards Canon Law now waste,

49
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,200
which could be a professor,

50
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:21,190
but he nonetheless found himself as
the only non clergy member serving.

51
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,000
As such,

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,070
although the order has been suppressed,

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,630
they still wielded considerable power
at the university and Weiss hubs and his

54
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,940
enlightenment influenced ideas well.

55
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,980
We hit some roadblocks as a result,

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,230
helped grew to dislike clerics.

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,040
He was frustrated and he wanted a way
to spread the words of the enlightenment

58
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,170
without being stonewalled by the chair.

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,780
Ouch.

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,070
So he decided to start his own society
about what was the goal of this society.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,780
This is the great object held down by
this association as the means of attaining

62
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:59,440
it is illumination enlightening the
understanding by the son of reason which

63
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:04,360
will dispel the clowns of superstition
and prejudice initially why sobs didn't

64
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,060
want to start his own secret society
he had wanted to join the free masons,

65
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:12,490
is a group that he thought would line up
nicely with his passion for reason over

66
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,324
religion,

67
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,530
but ultimately he decided that the free
masons weren't exactly what he wanted

68
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,310
and so he took the leap and
started his own society.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,110
He didn't look to the freemasons for
inspiration in rituals and organizational

70
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:26,591
structure,

71
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,820
though overtime,

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,000
especially after I stopped,

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,550
ended up joining the freemasons.

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,430
The two groups became more
linked in the minds of many,

75
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,730
especially conspiracy
theorists to start a society.

76
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,980
Why Sampson began reaching
out to like minded men.

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,570
He had befriended at university,

78
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,220
but they had to be young men.

79
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,370
Anyone over 30 was just too unlikely to
be influenced by new ideas and I tapped.

80
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,480
He wanted the men who joined to be true
believers in the enlightenment ready to

81
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,320
start spreading the ideals of reason
and spreading them as high up as they

82
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:56,800
could.

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,230
The group of men first match in May of 17,

84
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,040
76,

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,830
only five of them arrived in the forest
that first night carrying torches and

86
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,230
ready to embark on their quest to
spread their ideas to the world to be

87
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,760
initiated into the Illuminati.

88
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,020
Why Sally wanted his members to
experience being reborn this way,

89
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,310
they would be leaving behind their lives
before joining the Illuminati and to be

90
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:23,140
able to fully immerse themselves in their
commitment to the new secret society.

91
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,790
The initiation rights included sacrifices
and mystical elements who did men

92
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,690
unknown identities in darkened
rooms are hallmarks of such rights.

93
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,630
Games have been made that the
Illuminati initiation rights.

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,690
I've taken the sacrifice element
to its most extreme stage,

95
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,810
the sacrificing of an actual human
being to be initiated and reborn.

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
The idea is that the new member would
have to experience death and be reborn and

97
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,720
actually killing someone would give
them an insight into the experience of

98
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:53,200
death,

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,280
but the initiation rite is also sent to
have given many members the experience

100
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,370
of death and rebirth through
the killing of an animal.

101
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,340
The illuminati would put an
animal on top of the new member,

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,900
kill the animal and just let it bleed to
death on top of the new member soaking

103
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:08,860
in the animal's bloods,

104
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,680
encouraged rebirth and
the understanding of life,

105
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,840
death and knowledge overall.

106
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,430
Why Sally did not want the Illuminati
to remain just a small academic society

107
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,380
that operated in an echo chamber,

108
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:25,381
though he wanted it to reach the highest
echelons of society with members both

109
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:29,920
influencing political leaders and even
the coming political leaders themselves,

110
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,040
but he also didn't want the
society to grow full of men.

111
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,060
He couldn't trust until you weren't
truly dedicated to the course.

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,970
So the men that mets that first night,

113
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,970
we'd have to be agreed to by the five
members present at night as well as prove

114
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:46,030
themselves to be from families
of high standing and wealth.

115
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,280
The latter two requirements
would help with myself,

116
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,870
skull to get his ideas moving up the
societal ladder and into the minds of

117
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,180
intellectual families and society.

118
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,601
Now,

119
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,770
the order's famous name.

120
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:59,310
It didn't to ice out right
away the first name boy,

121
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,780
his secretive group was the perfect lists,

122
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,130
a name that they actually
stuck with for two years.

123
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,450
The idea that a man is perfectible
was part of the group's ideals.

124
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,170
Even American founding father Thomas
Jefferson appreciated this trait of ice

125
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,370
arts and design ideas,

126
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,360
stating why Sam's seems to be
an enthusiastic philanthropist.

127
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,470
He is among those,

128
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,921
as you know,

129
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,360
the excellent Richard price and priestly
also are who believe in the indefinite

130
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,590
perfectibility of man.

131
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,910
He thinks he may in time be rendered so
perfect that he will be able to govern

132
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,740
itself in every circumstance,

133
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,870
so as to engine none to do well,

134
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,010
the goody can to leave.

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,270
Government had no occasion to exercise
their powers over him and of course to

136
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:42,950
render political government useless
before the name Illuminati was officially

137
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:43,580
adopted.

138
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:43,800
Why?

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,200
Sam's also thought about naming the
group the be order that's in the Nazi was

140
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,430
ultimately decided upon.

141
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,130
And why Sam's took the
owl as the group symbol.

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,210
So now you might be wondering,

143
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:53,361
well,

144
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,230
why did you choose now?

145
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,690
What exactly is the
significance of this bird?

146
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,890
Now Minerva,

147
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:00,920
the goddess of wisdom was
accompanied by an owl.

148
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,210
The Owl was away for ways,

149
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:06,680
helped to indicate the intellectual
basis for the secret society while still

150
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,990
keeping its symbolism just to be coded.

151
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,100
The new name was a callback to the
occult beliefs within the Spanish culture

152
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,120
during medieval times,

153
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:18,290
alchemists and magicians were believed
to be imbued with a light that signified

154
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,400
the presence of a higher power
within within the society.

155
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,990
The members took nicknames.

156
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,241
Why?

157
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:26,870
Subs as the head of the
order was spartacus,

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
while other adopted names
from members included,

159
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,550
a Jackson Tiberius in 17,

160
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,450
77.

161
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,760
Why's helped found a new
avenue for recruiting.

162
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,560
He was accepted into a free masons group
in Germany and use their society as a

163
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,630
place to find well connected society.

164
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:46,631
Men who were already acquainted with
and interested in secret societies.

165
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,070
The men who were welcomed
in were told the following.

166
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,920
Should you see might power
false honor excess seek vote.

167
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,090
We would work for you to provide
your temporal advantages.

168
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,470
We will bring you as close to the throne
as you wish and then turn you over to

169
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,060
the consequences of your folly,

170
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,000
but our inner sanctuary
remains closed to such,

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,990
which who do you want to learn?

172
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,960
Wisdom wants to learn to
make mankind's more clever,

173
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,700
better free and happy,

174
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,100
then be thrice welcomed by us.

175
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,390
The men who joined new found order found
themselves a part of a group that was

176
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:22,070
split into distinct levels as much as
waste helped refine the principles of

177
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:25,550
rationalism and individualism related
to the enlightenment movements,

178
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,380
the men who were a part of his fault,

179
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,890
where restrictors in their knowledge
about what was going on within their own

180
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:31,724
organization.

181
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,000
The illuminati had a hierarchy within
the structure and the members at the

182
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,710
bottom reported to those.

183
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,660
At the top there were three ranks of men,

184
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,890
novice minerval and illuminated minerval
eliminate them interval where at the

185
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,730
top of the Illuminati is pecking order
than I am inspired by the Roman goddess

186
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:47,540
of wisdom.

187
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,710
They spied on each other
and on the political and
economic goings on in society.

188
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,740
Bringing news back to the order and to
helping the Illuminati move forward and

189
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:58,560
its goals of influencing
the top tiers of society.

190
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,580
Do you realize sufficiently what it means
to rule to rule in a secret society,

191
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,240
not only over the lesser or
more importance of the populace,

192
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,450
but over the best of men
over men of all ranks,

193
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:14,100
nations and religions to rule without
external force to unite them in

194
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:17,190
dishonorably to breathe one
spirit and soul into them.

195
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,850
Men distributed over all parts
of the world in his first year,

196
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,490
so they'll even ask.

197
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,070
It didn't grow by leaps and bounds.

198
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,700
Initially,

199
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,910
they found only a few dozen
interested in qualified men to join.

200
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,700
They know that it's just 60 by 78 80,

201
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,541
but that year,

202
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,960
why stopped added amendment to the
Illuminati who proved himself to be

203
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:38,520
especially helpful in gaining new members
and he also attracted a new level of

204
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,190
respect for the secret
society and this new member.

205
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:42,090
He came from.

206
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,610
Why Sampson recruiting
grounds in the freemasons,

207
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,640
baron adult Conega had been
a member of the freemasons,

208
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,430
but he had risen as far as he
could go within their ranks.

209
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,010
So when he heard of y soft
and his new smaller group,

210
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,490
he saw an opportunity to have real
sway over what was going on in the

211
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,324
organization.

212
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,530
He also likes the Illuminati
is relationship with
mysticism and forming the

213
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,010
order why Sam's had relied
in part on mystic texts.

214
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,060
He read the mysteries of the seven sages
of Memphis and the Kabbalah and the two

215
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:09,421
tanks.

216
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,030
It's made an impact on how he
viewed the world around him.

217
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,130
Baron Canoga was also a students of
such ideas and liked that why salvage

218
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,980
brought their influence
into the Illuminati when
he joined gonna get eagerly

219
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:22,110
read the texts required of new members,

220
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,980
most consistent of works that were banned
in the conservative Catholic Bavaria.

221
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,730
In fact,

222
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,150
contigo read the text so quickly
that we had to stall for time.

223
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,080
He didn't want can I get to reach the
illuminated minerva level so quickly?

224
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,400
So he put off Grenada.

225
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:35,790
Well,

226
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,510
he tried to come up with new ideas
for readings and required actions,

227
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,560
but kinda figured out that y sub two is
trying to delay his achievements of the

228
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,510
highest level when he
brought this up to wise,

229
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,111
help wise,

230
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:46,411
helped,

231
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,460
was willing to listen.

232
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,430
It was also willing to
listen to Canadians.

233
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,450
New ideas for the order for one Canadian
said the order needed a rearrangement

234
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,620
of its hierarchy.

235
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,520
He suggested bringing in new levels
under the existing three levels.

236
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,410
The end result of this was 13 ranks of
Illuminati members each subdivided within

237
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,970
the original three levels.

238
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,630
The three new overarching levels
have the names of the nursery,

239
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,980
the messianic grades,

240
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,790
and the mysteries can also
used his influence to change.

241
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,021
Why?

242
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:18,300
How strong messaging about
the church and about religion.

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,620
He realized that such a strong stance
might be hampering the group's ability to

244
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:27,621
grow and recruit new and powerful members
after the church wielded much power in

245
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,340
Bavaria in the 18th century,

246
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:33,900
and even the promise that our society
with secrets might not be strong enough

247
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,410
assurance for men from powerful
families to risk joining.

248
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,030
Why subs listens to you.

249
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,570
Can you get.

250
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,770
And the Illuminati,

251
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:43,680
they benefited from an
organization of just 60.

252
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,110
They grew to 200 by 17,

253
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:46,740
82,

254
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,580
then the group group to
3000 members by 1784.

255
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,150
The illuminati or Dorsey spread beyond
varia membership now included Hungary,

256
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,810
Poland,

257
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,643
and Italy.

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,730
But having that many members spread
throughout a number of countries made it

259
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:03,280
harder and harder to keep things quiet,

260
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,790
and if they're very purpose was to
infiltrate and influence political thought

261
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,624
and actions,

262
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,690
then of course the upper echelons of
society would start to notice them.

263
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,230
In 1794,

264
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,850
that group became a problem.

265
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,780
Then members of the Illuminati were
sending correspondence back and forth and

266
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:27,560
the governments have their eye out for
his writings with internal Illuminati

267
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,900
ideas and policies were
intercepted in Bavaria.

268
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,600
It's also been thought that this
interception was set up by this point wise

269
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,250
helped handsome,

270
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,870
disgruntled members within his ranks.

271
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,600
When we first started the organization,

272
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,920
he told some members that
would be a supernatural
communication if they achieved

273
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,110
the highest level within the society,

274
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,540
but plenty of people who
had achieved this by 17,

275
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:52,541
84 and there was no supernatural
communication to be hat
baron can Nigga and why

276
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:53,990
Sam's.

277
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,510
They also had a major disagreements.

278
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,590
They didn't have the same idea about
some of the societies rituals and their

279
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:03,710
arguments culminated in Canoga
leaving the secret society.

280
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,720
The same year he left the Illuminati.

281
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,930
The Bavarian government
banned all secret societies.

282
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,580
That was in 1784,

283
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,890
which was the same year that
the membership had exploded.

284
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,963
By the next year.

285
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,040
The Bavarian government
took it a step further.

286
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,120
They banned the Illuminati specifically
as part of the Illuminati banishment.

287
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,580
The government began reading.

288
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:26,090
The documents have known Illuminati
documents started to be published,

289
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:28,010
and it's this secret
society and its membership.

290
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,510
It wasn't so secret anymore.

291
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,320
Public officials became known as members
putting that livelihoods and societal

292
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,310
rankings on the line.

293
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,880
The illuminati simply couldn't
function with its membership.

294
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,260
Being known throughout all of this society
building and government influencing

295
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,990
why sapped had still been working as a
professor at the University of English

296
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,520
stocks,

297
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,470
but when the government
banned the Illuminati,

298
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,640
he was forced to flee his home
and leave behind his job wise,

299
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,300
it wasn't kind to the governments,

300
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,430
to governments of any
sorts of not just Bavaria,

301
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,200
so it is not surprising that they
were not pleased with his writings.

302
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,340
So just how strongly did he
feel about the governments?

303
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:01,760
Well,

304
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,690
take this quote,

305
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,230
when man lives under government,

306
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,120
he has fallen,

307
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,860
is worth is gone and his nature tarnished
when the illuminati were bands from

308
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:10,460
Bavaria.

309
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,000
Why Sandra was forced to fleet
to go to another part of Germany.

310
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,141
That waste helped,

311
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:17,060
was protected by a sympathetic duke.

312
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,340
Duke Ernest not only provided
political protection for Weiss ops,

313
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,320
but he also gave him a pension that's
allowed him to live without working.

314
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,620
Even though the Illuminati had been
disbanded in various [inaudible],

315
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,730
kept pushing the ideas that had led him
to start the secret society in the first

316
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:32,300
place.

317
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,570
He began rising ultimately publishing
for books about the history of the

318
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:36,980
Illuminati and defending.

319
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:37,880
It's existence.

320
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,380
The books were intended both to defend
himself and to perhaps encourage new

321
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,190
growth for the Illuminati
and the province of Gota.

322
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,750
There's one way helped
passed away in 1830.

323
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,810
The illuminati had all but
disappeared from the world.

324
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,230
It's not easy to operate
even as a secret society.

325
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,910
When major world powers,

326
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,110
they simply want you gone.

327
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,330
While the Illuminati may have disappeared,

328
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,010
at least in membership in Europe.

329
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,140
The group by no means disappeared from
the world's imagination and conversations

330
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,280
based on today's conspiracy theories
and the prevalence of the Illuminati and

331
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,114
pop culture.

332
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,440
It can be argued that why south succeeded
in creating a secret society that had

333
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,030
an influence on the world.

334
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,110
Dan Brown's massively popular novels
feature the Illuminati in angels and

335
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:21,680
demons.

336
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,160
Brown pits the Illuminati against the
Catholic church in a modern setting.

337
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,121
Throughout the book,

338
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,970
they use churches and
artwork to commit atrocities,

339
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,850
relying heavily on
coded symbolism benders.

340
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:35,960
The illuminati trilogy books that claim
George Washington was actually replaced

341
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,610
by a member of the Illuminati.

342
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,240
They claim that this imposter
actually ran the United States.

343
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,700
People even suggest that the ion,

344
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,520
the American $1 bill is an indication
of Illuminati interference and American

345
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:50,930
governments why stops and the Illuminati
are also used in video games and comic

346
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,460
books and even rap songs.

347
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,150
There are regular feature on history
channel shows and mysterious shows about

348
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,400
conspiracies from all around the world.

349
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,620
When major events happen,

350
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,940
think that JFK assassination
and nine slash 11,

351
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,320
the Illuminati name still gets tossed
around as a possible course and there's

352
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:10,630
even a theory that the
modern day Illuminati and now
headquartered in Bavaria or

353
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:11,464
where it was founded,

354
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,120
but right in the heart
of the United States.

355
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,470
I was in Washington DC,

356
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,490
not in New York,

357
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,600
not in Los Angeles,

358
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,740
but in Denver,

359
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,670
hidden beneath the airport
and the Colorado city is
said to be the headquarters

360
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:27,020
for the modern day incarnation of the
most powerful secret society in the world.

361
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,340
Everything from the airports,

362
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,510
runway design to its underground tunnels
have been pointed to as evidence for

363
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,750
why it's a perfect site for
the societies operation.

364
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,080
It seems that 250 years after we first
launched his idea for a secret society is

365
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,130
influenced,

366
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,270
is still felt from pop culture
to events of historic magnitude.

367
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,760
The illuminati is still a factor,

368
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,940
at least in terms of people
bringing up their name.

369
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,451
Now,

370
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,810
it might not be exactly what he
was planning or maybe it was,

371
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,310
do we really know how a secret
society operates and has influence,

372
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,900
I mean by south did plan for
the Illuminati to operate
in the backgrounds after

373
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:06,410
all,

374
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,960
