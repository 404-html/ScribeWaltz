00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,220
Just before you get
cracking with today's video,

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:05,260
do you want to say there's obviously going
to be a lot of Japanese pronunciation

3
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:05,501
in it?

4
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,180
As always,

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,120
I am doing my best.

6
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:08,330
If you'd like to have a good me anyway.

7
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,340
Do you use the comments?

8
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,420
That's what they're for.

9
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,800
So Hirohito,

10
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,380
he was the longest reigning
monarch in Japan's history,

11
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,660
serving as emperor for 63 years,

12
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,280
vested with Supreme Power
and viewed as a deity bias.

13
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:20,711
People.

14
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:25,711
He presided over a nation that's unleashed
a war savagery that shocked the world

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,480
is unprecedented radio
address to his nation,

16
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,180
announcing Japanese
surrender in World War Two,

17
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,110
you start all of the people only to be
followed with the bombshell that he was

18
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:36,130
not in fact a god,

19
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,800
but just a fallible man dress
like the people in this week,

20
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:40,840
spine graphics video,

21
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,310
we go beyond the pump,

22
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,510
the ceremony to discover the
man who was emperor Hirohito.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,090
By the middle of the 19th century,

24
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:07,630
the emperor of Japan had
become a title in name only.

25
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,640
The emperor was merely a figurehead with
no real say in matters of states been

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,470
changed with the ascension to the throne.

27
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,270
If he 120 seconds,

28
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,560
Emperor Meiji,

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,210
Meiji embarked upon a series of political
reforms that brought about an era of

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,970
enlightened rule by the
time of his grandson,

31
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,090
the future Emperor Hirohito his birth,

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,480
the cult of the emperor.

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,220
It was already well established.

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,150
Laws had been inactive for bidding
any criticism of the emperor.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,980
The birth of Emperor Meiji First
Grandson on April the 29th,

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,290
1981 was a time of rejoicing
throughout the empire.

37
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,480
The infant was given
the title Prince Michi.

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,110
He was named Hirohito,

39
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,540
which comes from a Chinese saying that
roughly translates to when society is

40
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,200
wealthy.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,940
The people are content area.

42
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:52,150
He did.

43
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,180
His father was the 21 year
old Crown Prince Akihito.

44
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,240
It was slightly built and
he was constantly unwell.

45
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,440
His mother was the 16 year olds princess,

46
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:03,310
so docker as was the custom
among Japanese royals.

47
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:06,540
The child was taken from his
parents and raised by a surrogate.

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,750
It was decided by the emperor that his
grandson be raised by a retired military

49
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:15,100
officer in order to provide the mental
toughness and discipline that would be

50
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,530
needed for his future of role as emperor.

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,290
The man that was chosen was
counts cower Mara summit,

52
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:20,801
Yoshi,

53
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,150
a retired vice admiral.

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,190
The emperor told tomorrow to raise
Hirohito as if he were his own grandson,

55
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,001
Carramar right,

56
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,300
raised the infants that is mentioned in
the hills outside of Tokyo when he was

57
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,170
14 months old.

58
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,210
Hirohito was drawings
by his younger brother,

59
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,380
Prince Yasuhito.

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,850
Every aspect of the children's lives was
carefully overseen including the foods

61
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:42,010
they eat and the clothes that they wore,

62
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,470
but then in November of Nineteen,

63
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:43,571
oh,

64
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:47,920
four calmar had died and suddenly the
two boys were reunited with their parents

65
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,500
that the crown princess I Yama Palace.

66
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,320
The boys were now attended
by a series of nurses.

67
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,220
The main carer,

68
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,160
if Hirohito was a woman
named at that sheet Tako,

69
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,660
who became his surrogate mother.

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,460
Hirohito,

71
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,030
develops into a sedate,

72
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,900
retiring,

73
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:04,450
and insecure Charles as would be expected.

74
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,960
He was fostered over and pampered
from the moments he work each morning.

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,530
This did nothing to develop
resilience and independence.

76
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,423
Even in play.

77
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,690
He was to be shown the Osmos reverence
when he ends up the children of the royal

78
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,920
palace played war games.

79
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,570
He was always to take the role of the
conquering general from the age of four

80
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:22,931
onwards.

81
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,100
Hirohito and his brother
were indoctrinated into the
military heritage of their

82
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,700
nation.

83
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,660
They will often taken some military
parades and war museums to gaze upon the

84
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,030
swords of former heroes Hirohito.

85
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,510
His worldview was builds upon
the belief that the entire past,

86
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,260
present,

87
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,930
and future of the great empire of Japan,

88
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,000
dependent on the wisdom of the emperor.

89
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,260
And so those few advises
that he surrounded himself
with at the age of seven,

90
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:52,120
Hirohito straining was put in the hands
of a hero of the Japanese war named

91
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,020
General Nogi.

92
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,300
Nogi insisted on strict
military discipline,

93
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,390
refusing to show any deference
for the princess position.

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,900
Instruction centered on things that
were considered essential in a future.

95
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,250
Emperor frugality,

96
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,970
patients,

97
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,720
diligence,

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,670
selfcontrol and manliness.

99
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:06,901
No,

100
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,030
he quickly made the young Hirohito
come to the realization that he was

101
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,481
physically,

102
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:13,630
we can tap to work hard to
develop physical strength.

103
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,451
As instructors,

104
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:14,521
uh,

105
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,191
Pierce College,

106
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,790
we're also told him to give special
attention to guiding him in military

107
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,420
matters.

108
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,290
By the age of 11,

109
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,250
Hirohito had been imbued with a strong
sense of reverence for his ancestors.

110
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,640
It was at that age that he
officially became a crown prince.

111
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,570
He was also given the rank of second
leftenant in the army a few months later,

112
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,060
and per meg died at the
age of 61 and Hirohito.

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,170
His father in Paris had the supreme
position in contrast to his own father,

114
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,511
Yoshi.

115
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,290
He's proved to be a weak
and indecisive emperor.

116
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,190
As a result of visors came to have
more and more sway in the royal court.

117
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,610
Yoshi did not involve
himself in state affairs.

118
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,090
His grandfather's death marks a turning
points in the life of the future.

119
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,570
Emperor,

120
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,310
a new phase of his training.

121
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,540
It was undertaken with the appointments
of a military aid to come to chamberlain

122
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,150
between the ages of 13 and 19.

123
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,070
He was given a military
and liberal arts education.

124
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,570
There's a school that had been specially
built for him within the confines of

125
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:08,800
the tech and now a palace.

126
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,610
It was instructed by the brightest
military minds in the lands.

127
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,550
Hirohito graduated from
the school in Nineteen 21.

128
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,301
By this time,

129
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,460
he had developed a
fascination with biology.

130
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,790
He liked nothing better than collecting
seashells and small insects during the

131
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,550
school years as teacher
of natural history.

132
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,580
It was a professor Hattori
for the next 30 years.

133
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,080
The story acted as his sermons and
all manner of scientific pursuits.

134
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,190
In 1921 hirohito visited Europe and
making him the first Japanese crown prince

135
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,330
do travel abroad.

136
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,290
He was out of the country for six
months visiting the United Kingdom,

137
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:41,741
France,

138
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,130
Italy,

139
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,640
Belgium,

140
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,440
and the Netherlands of this period.

141
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,303
He later wrote,

142
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,200
I knew freedom for the first time in
England's every move that the young prince

143
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:51,670
made while on tour was covered.

144
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,420
Fever initially by the world's press
having just returned from his overseas

145
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:55,991
excursion.

146
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,460
Hirohito was further into the limelight.

147
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,400
When his father retired his
office due to mental illness,

148
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,140
the future emperor was now the regions
he was to retain that this position until

149
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,270
his father died at the age of 23.

150
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,070
Hirohito married his distant cousin,

151
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,600
Princess Aco Cooney.

152
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,170
He did so against the advice of his
advisors who considered her to be an

153
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,730
unsuitable match for the future.

154
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,930
Emperor two years later,

155
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,950
with the death of his father,

156
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,250
his regency ended and
he became the emperor

157
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,630
Hirohito inherited the
throne on December the 25th,

158
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:35,021
19,

159
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:35,601
26.

160
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:39,580
The 25 year old was now
the 124th emperor of Japan.

161
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,880
This automatically meet him.

162
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,680
The commander in chief of the armed
forces is able to give orders directly

163
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,570
without consulting the cabinets.

164
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,660
He also became the chief
priest of the Shinto Religion,

165
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,760
guiding him in his new political life.

166
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,840
Hirohito was attended to by a seven
member palace entourage of men,

167
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:56,950
much older than himself.

168
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,731
These gathered,

169
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:00,700
filtered and disseminated political
information to the emperor.

170
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,690
Hirohito quickly established a vast
network of informants who relayed

171
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,200
information to him on the going
ons in every corner of governments,

172
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,220
even has a spy regularly reporting to
him on the political activities of his

173
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:12,820
brother,

174
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,870
Prince Chichibu.

175
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,830
The new emperor was keen to stamp his
footprints on the political landscape is

176
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:21,550
first acts was to announce a public
holiday in remembrance of his grandfather.

177
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,150
Then in an effort to show solidarity
with the peasantry during a time of

178
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:26,380
agricultural hardship,

179
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,640
he received at rice plants from all
over the empire and staged a ritualistic

180
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:33,730
rice planting events within the
palace grounds throughout the year.

181
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,061
Nineteen,

182
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:38,710
28 enthronement ceremonies and rituals
were carried out in honor of the emperor.

183
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,310
The celebrations climaxed in November and
December when hundreds of thousands of

184
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,150
people participated in banquets and
awards ceremonies in the emperor's name.

185
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,140
Millions of men were given to the needy
and thousands of prison sentences were

186
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:50,860
commuted.

187
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,040
The reign of Herod was
designated as show up,

188
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,580
which means enlightened piece
from the moments of as ascension.

189
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:00,760
The emperor was no longer to be
referred to you by his given name,

190
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,170
but rather by the title,

191
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,190
His Majesty,

192
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,420
the Emperor Hirohito came to power
during a time of economic hardship.

193
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,050
The crisis had led to the
rise of political power of
the military who now had

194
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:12,580
veto power over his cabinets.

195
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,160
Incidents of political
violence were not uncommon.

196
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,090
In 1932,

197
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:19,990
the prime minister in your kit was
assassinated and there was an attempt on

198
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,070
Hirohito his own life.

199
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,300
In 1932,

200
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,190
this incidence led to a
dramatic curtailing of the
emperors availability to the

201
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:27,820
public.

202
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,670
As Emperor Hirohito followed
a disciplines routine.

203
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,810
He rose at 6:00 every morning to prepare
for an English breakfast at seven.

204
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,740
Throughout the morning,

205
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,850
he would receive visitors,

206
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,320
enjoy a light lunch at midday,

207
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:41,350
and then spend the afternoon
pouring over and signing documents,

208
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,090
everything to his marriage and the GEICO.

209
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,720
It was a happy one with their only
source of anxiety being the failure to

210
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:50,020
produce an APP is advisors
urged him to take a concubine,

211
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:51,700
but he resisted this advice,

212
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,400
the couple of ball three daughters
before the heir to the throne,

213
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,234
Naca Hito.

214
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,640
In 1933,

215
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,631
the couple of wind zones,

216
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,910
you have a total of seven children.

217
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Japan had enjoyed a level of unprecedented
growth and prosperity during the 19

218
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:14,620
twenties.

219
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,131
In essence,

220
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:18,250
the country existed as a
democracy during this period,

221
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,200
which lessens the
influence of the military.

222
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,860
This came to an ends with the onset of
the depression and during which time the

223
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,610
strong measures advocated by the military
leaders began to gain ascendancy.

224
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,440
The unification of neighboring China
also fed into the call for a strong

225
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,790
militaristic hands.

226
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,803
In 1931,

227
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,700
the military moved
against civilian leaders,

228
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:41,200
but first they devised a plan to go
to war with Manchuria by blowing up a

229
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:45,160
portion of the south Manchurian
railway and they made on the Chinese.

230
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,130
This gave the pretext for
an invasion of Manchuria.

231
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,730
The emperor Nazi mentioned the government
was completely in the dark about any

232
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:52,600
of these goings on.

233
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,940
This set the scene for the 19 thirties.

234
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:58,840
This was a period during
which the military pretty
much accepts in an arbitrary

235
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:03,490
fashion when the army began a full scale
invasion of China Hirohito orders that

236
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:04,240
they stop.

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,601
However,

238
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:09,070
the cabinet managed to persuade
the emperor to acquiesce
and allow this invasion

239
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,030
to proceed.

240
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,180
Hirohito felt powerless
to reign in the army,

241
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:16,090
ever a fearful that doing so
would result in his assassination.

242
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,290
In 1932,

243
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,050
he gave the go ahead for
the bombing of Shanghai.

244
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,590
The assault was also approved by
the Chinese leader Chiang Kai Shek,

245
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:28,210
who saw it as an opportunity to put
down a rebel group who were based in

246
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,044
Shanghai.

247
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,590
The bombing and subsequent invasion
led to tremendous loss of life,

248
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,750
unleashing worldwide condemnation.

249
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,070
Hirohito was worried that the Americans
might respond militarily and told the

250
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,870
army to withdrawal again.

251
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,910
They ignored the commands
of their emperor.

252
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,770
The Japanese went onto
completely subjugate Shanghai
by now mentioned area was

253
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:50,440
completely occupied and had
become a Japanese state.

254
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,770
Many Chinese were simply put to
death by the occupying force.

255
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,281
Once again,

256
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:57,400
this broad public condemnation with
the League of nations condemning the

257
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:00,460
Japanese in response Japan
resigned from the League,

258
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,460
despite the emperor is
designed to remain within it,

259
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,380
unable to stop the withdrawal.

260
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,460
He insisted that his foreign minister
of stress that Japan was determined to

261
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,630
work to achieve world peace throughout
the 19 thirties spurred by the flexing of

262
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,660
its military muscle.

263
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,670
A sense of nationalism grew in Japan
that saw a reverence for the Samurai

264
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:19,181
traditions,

265
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:19,780
volts.

266
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,090
All of this feeds into the
worship of the emperor,

267
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,750
which was especially strong among the
rank and file of the armed forces.

268
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,310
These soldiers viewed Hirohito as a god
and pledged their lives to serve him.

269
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,500
In 1934,

270
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,860
Japan began to enlarge its navy and
direct violation of the Washington Naval

271
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,570
Treaty of Nineteen 22 which had restricted
it's science to three fifths of the

272
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,403
United States and Great Britain.

273
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:41,650
Yes,

274
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,040
again,

275
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,480
Hirohito was against the move,

276
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,760
but it was not strong enough
to stand up to the military.

277
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,620
The flexing of military muscle came to
a head in February of 1936 when their

278
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,790
records and uprising led by army officers.

279
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,421
Finally,

280
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,190
Hirohito acted decisively.

281
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,480
He ordered the immediate suppression of
the revolts along with the execution of

282
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,470
its instigators,

283
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:09,790
Aaron.

284
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,680
He said it was powerless,

285
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:11,160
however,

286
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,620
to stop the growing power of the military.

287
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,880
By 1937,

288
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:19,440
the situation with China had developed
into all out war era who had agreed to a

289
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:23,100
buildup of forces in occupied China in
order to stem the tide of communism.

290
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,360
But he soon realized that hostilities
were escalating uncontrollably and he

291
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,610
insisted that the army pulled back.

292
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,971
However,

293
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,050
the military bras,

294
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,943
they were not listening.

295
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,160
A full scale attack was made on
the Chinese capital of Nan King.

296
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,320
In the wake of the subjugation of Nanking,

297
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:41,820
the Japanese Army unleashed an orgy of
rape and murder that shocked the world

298
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,260
known as the rape of Nanking.

299
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:47,010
It resulted in the death of as
many as 200,000 Chinese men,

300
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,170
women and children worldwide.

301
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:52,680
Condemnation for the atrocities of
Nan King were heaped upon Japan,

302
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,640
still the armed forces forged on
in their attempt to conquer China.

303
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,151
However,

304
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,840
the country was simply too large with
the result of the Japanese military was

305
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:03,450
tied up in a hopeless
mission on foreign soil.

306
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,250
For the next four years,

307
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,960
by the outbreak of the Second World War,

308
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:08,970
the combination of nationalism,

309
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,950
emperor worship and military control had
forged a Japan into a nation that was

310
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:16,920
ready and eager to enter
hostilities with other nations.

311
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,330
After all going to war was seen
as doing the will of the emperor.

312
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,810
The reality was that Hirohito was opposed
to the idea of his country going to

313
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:25,230
war.

314
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,650
He was a pacifist as heart
since was cautious by nature,

315
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,630
but he was simply too weak.

316
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:35,130
Wills to control the reigns of a military
that was chomping at the bit to exert

317
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:36,870
its controlled throughout the far east.

318
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,730
In September 19,

319
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:48,061
40,

320
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:51,660
Japan entered into a threeway
alliance with Germany and Italy.

321
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,490
This gave the military leaders
the confidence do extend
its conquests in the Far

322
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:56,550
East.

323
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,720
The first victim would be the
French colony of Indochina
with the French already

324
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,340
having been beaten by Germany.

325
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,540
It was easy pickings.

326
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,050
The emperor,

327
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,411
however,

328
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:09,270
was opposed to the move on
principle considering it to
be like acting as a thief

329
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,313
in a fire.

330
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,280
In 1941,

331
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:14,850
Japan signs a nonaggression
pact with the Soviet Union.

332
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,780
This gave the military the confidence
do extend its occupation into southern

333
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,770
Indochina in response to the United
States imposed tough sanctions on the

334
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:23,580
Japanese.

335
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,910
They also put an embargo on
all oil exports to Japan.

336
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,020
This move forced Japan's hands with the
results that the decision was made to go

337
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,940
to war with the United States.

338
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,601
As usual,

339
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,001
the emperor,

340
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:38,760
I felt powerless to stop this military
juggernaut with the attack on Pearl

341
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,660
Harbor on December seventh,

342
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:40,141
19,

343
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:45,090
41 war was declared between the
United States and Japan Hirohito,

344
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:46,420
though not opposing the plan,

345
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:51,030
the attack has always intended that
Japan would declare war before striking.

346
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,910
You considered the surprise attack on
Hawaii as dirty tactics and was extremely

347
00:14:55,911 --> 00:15:00,170
upset with the military for the manner
in which this attack was carried out with

348
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,160
a much longed for war now upon them all
of Japan put their shoulder to the wheel

349
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,360
in support of victory.

350
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,051
Ironically,

351
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:09,920
the emperor who had never been an
advocate of the war was looked to as the

352
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,170
champion of the Japanese war efforts.

353
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,270
During the first few months of 1942,

354
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,980
Japan won victory after victory.

355
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,360
Malaya Singapore at time,

356
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,070
but then a heavy blue was inflicted when
an American bombing raid was unleashed

357
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,140
upon a number of key Japanese cities.

358
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,310
The Battle of midway was the
first military defeats and things.

359
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,600
They simply never recovered.

360
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,130
By the end of 1944,

361
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:35,720
Japan's lost hopes rested with the
kamikaze pilots who vowed to die for their

362
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:39,110
emperor by crashing their planes
into American aircraft carriers,

363
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,540
but this was simply too little,

364
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,480
too late.

365
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,670
Hirohito was by now eager to see an
end star civilities for the first time.

366
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,880
He involved himself in
the planning of a battle.

367
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,090
If one would force,

368
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,820
the Americans do propose
a peace settlement,

369
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,560
the resulting battle of Okinawa,

370
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,770
so some of the fiercest
fighting of the entire war.

371
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,400
However,

372
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,140
the emperor has planned it backfired.

373
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,490
The American casualties were so high that
they despaired that the Japanese would

374
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,300
ever surrender with American
bombs decimating his key cities.

375
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,820
Hirohito was ready to put
an end to the carnage,

376
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,170
but once again,

377
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,910
he was overridden by his military
commanders who vowed to never surrender.

378
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,710
On August the sixth and ninth,

379
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,041
19,

380
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,850
45,

381
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,320
the Americans dropped atomic bombs on
the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

382
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,780
Despite the terrible loss
of life that resulted,

383
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,470
half of the prime minister's
cabinet were opposed to a surrender.

384
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,393
The deadlock.

385
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,900
It was broken by the emperor.

386
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,530
On August the 15th.

387
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,010
The people of Japan heard the voice
of their emperor for the first time.

388
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,510
He told them that Japan was surrendering
to the allies in stating his reasons

389
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,344
for the surrender.

390
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,540
He said with reference to the atomic bomb,

391
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,690
that a continuation of the struggle would
lead to the total extinction of human

392
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:03,730
civilization before most
surrender took place on September.

393
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,800
The second is on board the USS Missouri,

394
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,720
Arizona did not have to suffer.

395
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:11,530
The indignity of attending Japan was
now an occupied country under the

396
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,510
management of General Douglas Macarthur.

397
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,110
The emperor expressed
a desire to advocate,

398
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,730
but he was persuaded to
remain in place by macarthur.

399
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,480
Giving him on the throne would help to
provide some semblance of normality.

400
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,550
As Japan emerged from the ashes of war,

401
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,720
the allies drew up a list of 28 top
wartime leaders who are culpable of

402
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,120
committing crimes against
humanity during the war,

403
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,530
and they put them on trial.

404
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Hirohito,

405
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,510
though it was not among them,

406
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,000
still many pointed the
finger at the emperor.

407
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,740
Surely if he was a god,

408
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,810
he could have stopped the atrocities

409
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,070
with announcing pressure.

410
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,230
Hirohito spoke to his
people for a second time.

411
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:57,740
Over the radio or Lydia
state in 1946 this time,

412
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,240
what he had to say was even more
shocking than his announcement of the

413
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,000
surrender.

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,980
He was not a god he told the nation,

415
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,960
but just an imperfect human being just
like them in the way of this bombshell

416
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:09,680
announcement.

417
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,940
His title was officially changed from
imperial sovereign to constitutional

418
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:14,600
monarch.

419
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,650
Throughout the next few years,

420
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:17,690
Hirohito made many public appearances.

421
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:18,200
He taught,

422
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,810
bombed out cities and
inspected new factories.

423
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,200
Now he dressed in a suit and tie and
looking more like a prime minister from an

424
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,390
emperor Hirohito.

425
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:30,240
His image was now reshaped into the
symbol of the wells to do Japanese middle

426
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,580
class success story.

427
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,660
He was what the ordinary Japanese man
could strive to be if you worked hard

428
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,550
enough free of his imperial duties.

429
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:41,300
The former emperor now had time to
indulge his passion for biology.

430
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,590
In the ensuing decades,

431
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:45,800
Sarah Hito faded into the
backgrounds of Japanese significance.

432
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,650
He was increasingly seen as
a symbol of the old Japan,

433
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,610
the new Japan.

434
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,710
It was focused on industrialization,

435
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:52,580
consumerism,

436
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:53,930
and a strong work ethic.

437
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,580
His value was now as a public relations
figure who was occasionally wheeled out

438
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,220
and sent around the
world on goodwill tours,

439
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,780
still the specs of the passing of
the emperor in the mid 19 eighties,

440
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:19,810
so an outpouring of grief and profound
respect among all classes and all ages in

441
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:20,690
Japan,

442
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,750
but also there was the
question of war responsibility,

443
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,470
but the consensus was and remains
that Hirohito bore a measure of moral

444
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:31,820
responsibility for the atrocities that
were committed in China and through the

445
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,920
Far East in the 19 thirties and forties,

446
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,590
the ends.

447
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,350
It ultimately came on January the seventh,

448
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:36,651
19,

449
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:37,161
89,

450
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,130
the result of God,

451
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,983
no cancer.

452
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,980
The funeral was attended by
representatives of 163 nations.

453
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,520
Many have mixed feelings about being
bad because of the war responsibility

454
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:47,780
question great persons.

455
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:52,190
Prince Philip later said that he overcame
his conscience by not bowing before

456
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,551
the emperor.

457
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:55,250
His casket simply nodding
his head slightly,

458
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,160
so I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

459
