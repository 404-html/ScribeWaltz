1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
He was billed as the eighth wonder of
the welds are legitimate as a giant of a

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:05,240
man,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,860
seven foot four inches tall,

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,930
then more than 500 pounds.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,440
Andre the giant was the
greatest attraction the wells
of professional wrestling

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,830
has ever seen yet his appeal.

7
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,460
It went far beyond the ring.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,340
With this humble manner
in his boundless trauma,

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,090
Andrea became one of the most famous and
recognizable athletes on the planet and

10
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,130
a genuine cultural phenomenon.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,611
Yes,

12
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,780
behind the celebrity.

13
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,070
Andrea was a man trapped inside a wells
he never created and one that would

14
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:32,690
ultimately destroy him.

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,890
The man we know is Andre the giant entered
the world as Andre or one of them off

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,381
on May,

17
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:54,880
the 19th of 1946.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,810
His father had migrated from
Belgium to France in 1934,

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,480
settling in more just outside of Paris.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,500
In 1938,

21
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:06,400
Boris had married Marianne Petite
Polish women who seemed began producing

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,000
offspring.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,330
Andre became the middle of five children.

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,670
Flores was a strong stout man who
stood just over six feet tall.

25
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,880
He works at the end as a farmer
and seen put his children to work,

26
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,930
cutting firewood,

27
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,010
tending the stock,

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,080
and otherwise getting their hands
dirty as Andre was 11 pounds,

29
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:27,190
but there were no signs of abnormal
growth during his first six years known as

30
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,590
Dt as a result of a system
is pronouncing his name.

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,230
He was a healthy good
looking and charming child's,

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,700
but as he grew older,

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,850
his rate of fiscal growth
outstrips that of his peers.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,170
This was especially noticeable in his
face were his drawer and foreheads became

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,430
unusually pronounced.

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,420
Andrea,

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,970
it again is ending school nearby.

38
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,910
It will see some mall.

39
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,150
He loved the social interaction
and proved to be a good students,

40
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,030
especially excelling
at mathematics already.

41
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,320
He towered over the other children,

42
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,700
not only those in his grades,

43
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:57,970
but also those in any great
he dominated in most sports.

44
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:01,300
Invariably finding himself in the position
of goalie on the soccer field where

45
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:03,310
there's large hands and long limbs.

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,890
It was virtually impossible
to get the ball past him.

47
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,910
By the age of 10,

48
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,710
Andre stood at six feet tall and
tip the scale at around 200 pounds.

49
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,400
He looks,

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,890
ends move like a full
grown man on the farm.

51
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,740
His father discovered he could do
the work of three boys his age,

52
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,280
so Boris took it out of school and
put him to work full time on the farm.

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,250
There is some office had little in
the way of material possessions.

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,520
They were a close family and the children
were raised with love and dignity,

55
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,200
though they simply learned to accept.

56
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,880
Watch came without complaints.

57
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,510
So when Andrea was taken
from school though he missed
the mental stimulation and

58
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,110
the association with the school mates,

59
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,410
he threw himself into
the life of a farmer.

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,010
Sure.

61
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,510
That this was to be his lot.

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,530
The physical labor coupled with Andres
on natural growth potential allows him to

63
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,210
develop a level of physical
strength that stunned on look,

64
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,550
it's by the age of 15.

65
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,480
He was able to lift a car so that his
brother could change the ta without having

66
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:53,410
to worry about a wheel.

67
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:54,040
Jack.

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,000
It was around the age of 16 though that
Andres growth spurt went to a whole new

69
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:58,570
level,

70
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,230
is high too.

71
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,550
Approach seven feet and his weight
went into the three hundreds.

72
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,573
But his parents,

73
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,790
they will also really concerned about
his growth spurts and Andre was never

74
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,950
taken to see a doc sap
during his mid teens,

75
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,250
Andrea,

76
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,520
again,

77
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,810
a woodworking apprenticeship.

78
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,220
After two years of diligence,

79
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,270
application and study,

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,990
he decided that the trade was not for
him and went to work at a factory that

81
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,330
made hay baling entrance,

82
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,640
but the monotony of working on an
assembly line was worse than what it had

83
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,990
previously been doing.

84
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,780
Andre had dreams of doing
something different.

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,490
He just didn't know what that was.

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,690
With no other options.

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,960
He went back to work for his
father on the farm by now.

88
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,890
His incredible size was constantly
drawing attention and he became known as a

89
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,940
local curiosity.

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,170
By the time he was 18,

91
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,630
his fame had spread as far as Paris.

92
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,980
That was a wrestling promotion,

93
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:46,180
so he'd gone to hear about the teenage
giants who was stronger than three men.

94
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300
He took the trip to car
and knocks on the door.

95
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,670
He told Boris and Marianne.

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,060
There's some at a future in wrestling and
the potential to make many Franks with

97
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,930
his parents consent.

98
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,200
Andrea began learning the fundamentals
of wrestling and was taken under the wing

99
00:03:59,201 --> 00:03:59,891
of Montreal.

100
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,270
Born wrestler runs promoter,

101
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,961
Frank Fowler,

102
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,500
war.

103
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,480
He began on the parisiene wrestling sac.

104
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:08,890
It's under the name of Joel in
honor of a mythical French giants.

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
Okay.

106
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Laundry worked as a furniture mover
during the day in order to cover his

107
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:23,610
expenses in Paris.

108
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,391
After work,

109
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:28,650
he could be found in a
wrestling gym slowly developing
his craft even though pro

110
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:31,710
wrestling then as now was
more entertainment than sport.

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,950
It was still necessary for
Andre to learn the basic moves,

112
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,580
falls,

113
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,910
and holds that would create the illusion
of violence while keeping him from

114
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:39,540
injury.

115
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:39,961
However,

116
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:40,890
with is intimidating,

117
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:41,730
size and strength.

118
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,880
It was hard to find an opponent who
was willing to share the ring with him.

119
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,750
As a result,

120
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,430
progress was slope despite this,

121
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,470
his sheer size and power insured,

122
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,000
but he never lost in the ring.

123
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,260
In 1965,

124
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,120
Andrea received a notice to
report to the army's draft board.

125
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,790
When he turned up for his physical exam,

126
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,430
the recruiters could hardly
believe what they saw.

127
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,550
A 19 year old who stood over seven
feet tall and weighed 350 pounds.

128
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,650
Despite his incredible
strength in good health,

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,850
he was deemed unfit for service for the
simple reason that the army did not have

130
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:15,600
any uniforms or shoes that were
big enough for him back in Paris,

131
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,120
only mess Eduardo Cop,

132
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,670
NCA,

133
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,050
a popular Montreal days,

134
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,450
Canadian wrestler all asking
the old man to train him.

135
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,750
Andre spent the next two months learning
valuable ring tips from the veteran

136
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,010
before leaving for home
called Pansy advised Andre
to get in the ring as much as

137
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,200
possible and to build experience.

138
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,770
He also promised that he would one day
bring Andre over to North America were

139
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:37,230
wrestling was much bigger
than it was in Europe.

140
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,800
Meanwhile,

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,460
Andre continued paying his
dues on the European seconds.

142
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,240
He traveled around Europe and even as
far as Africa developing a huge following

143
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,930
crowds were overwhelmed by
his sheer physical size.

144
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,310
Then as the match began,

145
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,040
they were delighted to see how
he overwhelmed his opponents.

146
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,200
In 1969,

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,220
Andrea ventured off the European continent
to wrestle in new where he was billed

148
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,200
as Monster Eiffel Tower.

149
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,120
Then he went to Japan where he competed
with an American partner in the Iwf

150
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,260
World tag team champs.

151
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,860
They've had one this isol and suddenly
boundary was a world champion.

152
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,240
It was while he was in Japan.

153
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:11,610
There's Andrea.

154
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,260
It was diagnosed by a doctor with the
condition that had caused his unusual

155
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:15,890
growth.

156
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,660
This condition was acromegaly.

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,790
It's a rare disorder of
the pituitary glands,

158
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,310
which leads to the overproduction
of human growth hormone.

159
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,870
It was caused by a benign tumor,

160
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,450
which if it develops before
bone growth was complete,

161
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,860
would lead to gigantism.

162
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,580
The doctor also informs Andre that life
expectancy for people with the condition

163
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,110
was 40 years.

164
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,360
Andrea told no one about his diagnosis,

165
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,860
keeping the secret that at 20 his life
was more than likely already half over,

166
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,250
but there's knowledge undoubtedly spurred
him on to reach the top of his chosen

167
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,380
profession as quickly
as he possibly could.

168
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,360
Having now won a world wrestling title,

169
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,380
he felt he had sufficiently paid his dues
and was ready to take on the Americans

170
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,080
from Japan.

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,980
He traveled to Canada where he
messed up with Eduardo carpentier.

172
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,530
Very became part of the
Montreal based crumb.

173
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,860
Pre Wrestling circuit quickly making
a name for himself on the basis of his

174
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,430
size,

175
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,850
charm,

176
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,380
and surprising agility in the ring.

177
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,550
He would often be paired against two or
even three opponents at a time in one on

178
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,031
one matches.

179
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,750
He took on undefeated such Canadian
luminaries as Calico while ski and butcher

180
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,240
[inaudible] on at the same time
as he was wrestling in Canada.

181
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:18,500
Andre made frequent trips back to Japan
where he was immensely popular that he

182
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:21,110
won the international wrestling
federations weld series,

183
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,230
defeating established stars like
Karl Gotch and Billy Robinson,

184
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:28,190
and the process Andrea hard work in
the ring was establishing him as a top

185
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,950
international draw cart in 1971.

186
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,950
He was named rookie of the
year by the wrestling yearbook.

187
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,090
Nineteen 72.

188
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,130
His biggest match today's came in May
1972 when he was pitted against the six

189
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,750
foot nine Mormon giants,

190
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,650
Don Leo,

191
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:46,940
Jonathan in what was built as the match
of the century with 20,000 people on

192
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:47,210
hands.

193
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,700
The match set an indoor
wrestling attendance records.

194
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,880
Now this match was going Andre's
way until he lost his temper.

195
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,170
And thrust is giant.

196
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,490
Hands around Leo's neck.

197
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,850
When his locker room guys ran into stop
him from choking out his opponents,

198
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,420
Andre,

199
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,060
toss them aside like ragdolls.

200
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,190
Eventually order was restored
and Andrea was disqualified.

201
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,330
He had lost the match,

202
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,030
but it also established
one of his key gimmicks.

203
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,680
He wants a lovable giants,

204
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,030
but if you make him mad,

205
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,380
he would turn into a killer.

206
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,920
After the bout with Don Leah,

207
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,780
Andrea began adventuring south to the
United States where he would appear as a

208
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,990
special attraction on the American
wrestling association carts.

209
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,980
Now it was time to reach out to
the biggest player in the market,

210
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,810
Vincent j Dot Mcmahon.

211
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,880
If the world wrestling federation,

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,160
Vince Mcmahon,

213
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,570
was first introduced to the man who
became his greatest superstar in June of

214
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:45,620
1973.

215
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,520
Until then,

216
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,580
Andre had been wrestling
under the name of Joel Fap.

217
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
Mcmahon's first move was
to rebrand the trials.

218
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,860
No one in America knew
who's your fair was,

219
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,630
but they could all relate
to Andre the giant.

220
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:57,841
Now,

221
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,580
as well as changing the name Mcmahon,

222
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,920
also modified Andres onstage approach.

223
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,820
Up until now,

224
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,100
he had shown remarkable athleticism.

225
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,930
Now he was to rely solely on his
overwhelming size and bulk to defeat his

226
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:10,764
opponents.

227
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,230
Andres first maps onto the wwf banner,

228
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,150
took place on March the 26th,

229
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,601
19,

230
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,320
73.

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
He easily defeated buddy wolf
at Madison Square Garden.

232
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,860
The American audience had never seen
anything like this giant of a man,

233
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,920
and he was immediately a
sensation mcmahon well,

234
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,690
he knew a good thing when he saw it.

235
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,410
Booking Andre to perform night
after night all over the country,

236
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,850
but keeping the big man moving,

237
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,900
Mckinnon was able to prevent the novelty
of the gentle giants from wearing off

238
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,190
everywhere he went.

239
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,260
Andrea shattered box office records.

240
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,340
Mcmahon was capital,

241
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:41,760
however,

242
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,930
not to pin him against other top drawers
for fear of damaging their prestige as

243
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:48,750
his popularity extended beyond
the wrestling community.

244
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,130
Andrea,

245
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,920
you began to receive offers for TV
appearances in the late 19 seventies.

246
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,160
He appeared on the tonight show.

247
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,530
When's the Merv Griffin show,

248
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,130
and was featured in such magazines
as sports illustrated and people.

249
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,390
In 1976,

250
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,080
Hollywood came calling the writer of
the most popular show on television.

251
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:08,490
The $6,000,000 man had decided to
capitalize on these string of Sasquatch

252
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,860
reportings that had recently been made.

253
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,970
They knew that there was only one man
who could realistically play the eight

254
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:16,470
foot tall forest creature,

255
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,590
and so it was that Andre Day covered suits
and prosthetic makeup and battles and

256
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,400
Lee majors has millions watched on
television to the horror of his legion of

257
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,181
preteen fans.

258
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:31,050
These $6,000,000 man was treated
like a ragdoll by the sasquatch.

259
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,430
Andrea followed up his first acting role
with a mixed discipline match fighting

260
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:35,880
boxer,

261
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,050
Chuck Wepner in June of 1976
at New York's share stadium.

262
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,890
The actually was a knockoff of Mohammed
Ali's famous matchup with Japanese

263
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:46,010
wrestler Ren Tonio and Gnocchi weapon,

264
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,550
or had one famous the only man to knock
down Ali and to be Sylvester Stallone's.

265
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,750
Inspiration for rocky.

266
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,040
The magic began with weapon,

267
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,760
a taunting Andre while seconding him
and throwing out a few jabs which the

268
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,440
towering restless and but he ignored.

269
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,740
It was well aware that he could
drop weapon at any moment,

270
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,780
but wanted to give the
audience their money's worth.

271
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,410
However,

272
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,430
in the third rounds weapon,

273
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,450
no managed to get a shot in that connects
it with Andres face and it was this

274
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,770
that got the big man's attention,

275
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,060
Andre Snort it,

276
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,450
and then his wepner with an inverted
atomic it drop and to headbutt.

277
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,410
He then picked the six foot three inch
weapon are up like a ragdoll and threw

278
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,550
him over the top rape.

279
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,890
The match with weapon had been a fast,

280
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,750
but it further cemented the legends
of Andre's invincibility in 1977.

281
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,960
He was listed as pro
wrestling illustrated.

282
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,530
Most popular wrestler promoters from all
over the welds pleaded for him to come

283
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,510
over and face off with our champion.

284
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,710
Okay.

285
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,830
Andrea had many hypes
rivalries and it's matchups.

286
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,060
During the period of
the late 19 seventies,

287
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,450
perhaps the greatest was
with Ernie big cat lat,

288
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,291
the six foot nine,

289
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,580
315 pounds.

290
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:01,990
Labs was a four time all star defensive
tackle who went on to become a career

291
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:02,500
wrestler.

292
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,420
He developed a very arrogant persona.

293
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,360
It has a pension for sticking his
thumb in the eyes of his opponents.

294
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,170
As a result,

295
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,010
he was hugely unpopular and
the perfect foil for Andrea.

296
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,360
The two wrestled regularly across the
country and matches build as battle of the

297
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,170
giants.

298
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,881
In 1988,

299
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:21,670
Vince Mcmahon had Andrea up with an up
and coming wrestler who had formerly been

300
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,420
a bodybuilder.

301
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,530
His name was terry.

302
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:28,531
The layer that is wwf stage name was
Hulk Hogan Mcmahon paired him up with a

303
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:32,770
theatrical easy manager by the
name of classy Freddie blassie.

304
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,970
Hoagie blassie were marketed as the
ultimate cheat team and the ideal

305
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,220
antagonists for the by the book Andre.

306
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,270
The tactic worked a treat with Hogan
becoming the most hated bad guy in wwf

307
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,400
history at 330 pounds.

308
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:45,700
So again,

309
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,340
marched his way through the
federation's Lesser Stars.

310
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,140
The fans demanded to match up with Andre
and in March of 1980 mcmahon made it

311
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:53,800
happen.

312
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,540
Despite his character bravado,

313
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,150
Hogan was terrified to
match up against Andre.

314
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,450
The very thought of working match with
the giants made him physically ill.

315
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,150
The matchup that resulted
seriously injured Hogan.

316
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,520
He recalls that Andre
messed up my shoulder,

317
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,630
screwed my neck out,

318
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,370
and Suplex to me on the head.

319
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,030
It soon became clear that Andrea
has a personal dislike for Hogan.

320
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,600
They traveled together to Japan for a
series of mattress as they went around the

321
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,020
country.

322
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,120
Andre continued to talk
to the young wrestler,

323
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,750
sitting in the back of the bus so that
he could bounce is empty beer cans off

324
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,040
the back of her head.

325
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,570
Hogan excepted the humiliating treatment
as something of a rite of passage by

326
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,530
the age of 34.

327
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,320
Andre had become the biggest
thing in the world of wrestling,

328
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,120
but to those outside of that world,

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,450
he was generally seen as little
more than a side show freak.

330
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,980
He was constantly subjected to the stairs
and jeers of the public and then there

331
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:45,190
were the discomforts imposed by his
guard down and she went frame and he

332
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,510
suffered from agonizing back pain and
joint elements and he could never find a

333
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,410
chair or a bed.

334
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,600
The provided anything approaching compass,

335
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,460
and of course always in the back of his
mind was the knowledge that his time was

336
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,270
running out.

337
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,520
He wasn't meant to make it past 40.

338
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,241
Andres.

339
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,160
Appetite for food was impressive,

340
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,150
but it was nothing compared to his liking.

341
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,830
Alcohol,

342
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,400
he loved French wine and would often
drink an entire case before lunch,

343
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,500
during more than one all
night drinking session,

344
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,600
he would knock back in excess of 100
handles of beer and even after this he

345
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:18,250
would show this little
sign of drunkenness.

346
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,030
Andrea and Hogan continued in their
[inaudible] through the end of 1980,

347
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,500
drawing huge crowds,

348
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,460
but by the next year,

349
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,050
Hogan had left the wwf over a disagreement
with mcmahon over his role in rocky

350
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,060
three as an 1981 began.

351
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,440
Andre was at the top of his game.

352
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,090
His rivalry with Hogan was soon replaced
with an ongoing feud with the Mongolian

353
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:41,950
giant killer Khan and I'm actually in
1981 con broad Andre to the canvas,

354
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,510
leaving vaginas unable to get up.

355
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,010
His ankle had snaps.

356
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,421
Andrea,

357
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:49,510
it was out for several weeks in the
storyline was that he was out for revenge.

358
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,160
Vein as again on July the 20th,

359
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,010
1981,

360
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,440
but the match ended in a
double disqualification.

361
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,500
Andre ones owns and dominates
through the early to mid eighties.

362
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,370
On April the seventh,

363
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,151
1986,

364
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:04,100
he prevailed in a 20 man battle royale
to come off the fixer at wrestle mania to

365
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,290
following Wrestlemania to Andre,

366
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,920
took a break from wrestling after a
decade and a half in the ring his body,

367
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,060
it was breaking down the health
effects of his disease where I'll say

368
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,903
compounding.

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,870
During this period,

370
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,450
he was given a pause in the
Rob Reiner directed movie,

371
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,410
the princess bride.

372
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,980
He played the role of the lovable drudge
physic and what has become a cult movie

373
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:24,110
classic rezonings to the WWF.

374
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,520
In 1987,

375
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,530
Andre faced up to his old nemesis,

376
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:28,310
Hulk Hogan,

377
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,560
who was also back in the wwf fault.

378
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,850
At wrestlemania three,

379
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,420
Andre weighed in at 520 pounds.

380
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,980
This puts a huge strain on his joints
and his lower back causing constant pain

381
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,060
in the final match shop.

382
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,350
Hogan defeated Andre with what became
known as the body slam heard around the

383
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:45,980
wells.

384
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,870
Hogan tourism has Dorsi muscle in the
monumental effort required to hoist the

385
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:51,510
giants over.

386
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,370
Had Andre though he got his revenge and
a rematch that was ed on the main events

387
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,050
in February of 1988.

388
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,760
He defeated Hogan and took the wwf
world heavyweight championship from him.

389
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,780
Andre went on for another four years,

390
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,850
but he wasn't the wrestler
that he had been in the past.

391
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,690
His body was racked with pain sometimes
to the point that he couldn't stand

392
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,980
without leaning on the ropes.

393
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,880
Andre owned a ranch in North Carolina
and spend more and more time.

394
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,440
There is this health deteriorated.

395
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,580
He was there and then January of 1993
when he heard that his father had died

396
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,450
back in France.

397
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,030
He helps on the next plane in
order to attend the funeral.

398
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,930
After the funeral,

399
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,330
he stayed on to spend time
with his mother and siblings.

400
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,190
On the night of January the 27th,

401
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,370
he died in his sleep as a result
of congestive heart failure.

402
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,070
His mother intended to bury
him alongside his father,

403
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:50,300
but Andre had recently revised as well
stating that he wished to be cremated in

404
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,410
accordance with his wishes.

405
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,610
His ashes were returned to the United
States and scattered on the grounds of his

406
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:56,200
ranch hotel,

407
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,940
be back in America and around the world.

408
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,960
Millions of fans mourns the loss
of the biggest and baddest man.

409
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,060
