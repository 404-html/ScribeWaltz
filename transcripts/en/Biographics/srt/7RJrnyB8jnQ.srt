1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,230
Belle starr has come down through time
is one of the great Amzie heroines of the

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:07,350
old west. She is the bandit
Queen, the female Robin Hood,

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:12,351
who was quick with our fists and even
quicker with a Colt 45 the reality though

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,410
was quite different.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,400
Develop history was a battler
who made some bad choices in men.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,540
Ended up twice widowed with two children
and made the most of the cards she was

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,000
dealt only to me, it's the most
violence events in today's biographics.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,270
We go beyond the legends to
reveal the Real Belle Starr

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,830
myra mayor bell Shelly.

10
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:48,480
The future bell star was born on
February the fifth 1848 in Jasper county,

11
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,070
southwest Missouri.
With that fact,

12
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,940
establish drilling down on the rest
of her life becomes far less. Certain.

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,050
Much of what is accepted is the
stuff of dime novel fiction.

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,920
Sorting out the fact from
the fiction here, it's been
a bit of a major challenge.

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,870
Now we do know that her father,

16
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:07,650
John Shirley was onto his third
wife when Myra came along.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,120
That third wife was named Eliza Pennington
Hatfields and she was a member of the

18
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:16,240
Hatfield family. Who famously feuded
with the Mccoy's or the couple.

19
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:20,610
I had three other children, all of them
boys with Myra being the second oldest,

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,880
John Shirley.
He was a wheat corn and hog farmer.

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,890
When Myra was six years of age,

22
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,210
he sold the farm for a tidy profit
and relocated the family to Carthage,

23
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,044
Missouri.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,860
He invested in real estate managing to
take possession of an entire city block

25
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,010
that housed a livery stable
blacksmith shop, a tavern,

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,020
and to hotel John Shelly.

27
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,700
He was a slave owner who is ardently pro
slavery in the explosive years before

28
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:45,870
the civil war.
Tensions.

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,610
They were high between pro and anti
slavery forces in Missouri when his oldest

30
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:55,611
son budge joins an infamous gang of
confederate sympathizers known as Quantros

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,040
Raiders John. He was extremely
proud. Meanwhile, Myra,

32
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,330
who insisted that she be
called bell whizzes growing
into a fine young lady. Uh,

33
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,930
parents were among the most prominence
in Carthage and she was able to enjoy

34
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:08,280
your life of semi privilege.

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,000
She attended the Carthage Female Academy
doing well in her studies where she

36
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,340
studied languages,
mathematics, and grammar.

37
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,180
She was also a talented piano player who
would entertain guests in the lobby of

38
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,200
the family owned hotel when he was
home from his rating expeditions bells,

39
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,270
older brother Bud taught her how to shoot.

40
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,890
She became an excellent shot developing
a reputation as a markswoman that would

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,890
later fuel her reputation
as the bandit queen.

42
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,780
So bell was 13 when the Civil Water
Apttus Carthage founds itself as a central

43
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,560
point of hostilities with no fewer
than 13 battles being waged in the

44
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:44,610
surrounding area during the four years
of the conflict with the war right on

45
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,270
their doorstep. Every person in
Carthage was forced to choose sides.

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,330
Pro and anti confederacy factions develops
with tensions escalating every single

47
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:53,820
day.

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,840
It has been reported that a teenage bell
acted as a spoiler for the confederacy

49
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,640
and even that she joined controls Raiders.

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,790
Both suggestions are unlikely.
However,

51
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,880
any news that she may have gotten about
a union treat movements she would no

52
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,730
doubt have passed onto.
But in June,

53
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,300
1864 bud was shot and killed by union
soldiers in [inaudible], Missouri.

54
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,570
When they surrounded the house that he
was in desperate to prevent any further

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,540
tragedy, the family packed
up and then move to Texas.

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,900
It turns out they got out of Carthage
just the right time. Three months later,

57
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,230
it was burned to the grounds
by confederate rebels
determined to drawing of

58
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,710
union soldiers out of the town bell jury
of one of the families wagons as they

59
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,080
wound their way down from
Missouri to a small town,

60
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,420
10 miles southeast of
Dallas called [inaudible].

61
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,200
Things doesn't go nearly as well for the
Shelley's in Texas as they had gone in

62
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,230
Missouri.
John had hoped to reinvest in a hotel,

63
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,620
but those plans didn't work out since
he was forced to return to farming.

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,850
Conflict arose with the locals who accused
John of taking more than his share of

65
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,030
water from the communal well,
bell was enrolled at the local one room,

66
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,880
school house, her attendance.
However, it was pretty erratic.

67
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,970
This was probably just cause she was
bored of the material having already

68
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,620
covered this when she was in college.

69
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,680
While that can cough edge bell had come
across a boy by the name of John Reed

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,140
Reed's who was two years older than bell,

71
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:16,760
joined quadrilles Raiders when he was
17 he was told and stocky and visibility

72
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:20,270
with his fists and a gun had and have
the respect of the other members of the

73
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:22,230
gang that admired him from afar,

74
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,430
but that family moved away before
a relationship could develop.

75
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,560
Bell was ecstatic to learn that
sometime around 1865 the reads that also

76
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,460
relocated to Texas, they quickly became
a couple ends on the 1st of November,

77
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,860
1866 they were married. Belle
was 18 at the time, Jim and bell,

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,660
they moved in with the Shirley family
where Jim helped out on the family farm.

79
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,790
Jim didn't take to farm work and see,

80
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,450
tried to sound as a salesman who worked
for a saddle maker in Dallas selling

81
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:50,990
saddles and bridles for a time
by the ends of 1867 however,

82
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,800
Jim's family had moved back to
Missouri and bell decided to join them.

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,890
Threads set themselves up
on a farm in Bates County.

84
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,690
Jim worked the lands with his brothers.

85
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,130
Then in September of 1868 belot gave
birth to a daughter Rosie leap from the

86
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:07,730
starch bell took to calling the baby
her little Pelle. Soon after this,

87
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:09,320
everyone was calling the maybe pile.

88
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,310
The first opportunity that John and Eliza
Shirley had to see their granddaughter

89
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:17,360
was when they'll rezone to Texas to attend
the funeral of a younger brother Ed.

90
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,370
The events surrounding
the murderer cloudy,

91
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:23,450
but it appears that he was involved in
horse theft following the funeral and

92
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:26,750
reunion with a parent's belt,
returns to the read farm in Missouri.

93
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,220
Her relationship with Jim,

94
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,910
it was strained as he spent less and
less time on the farm and more and more

95
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:35,570
time at the horse racing track.
It was one of the races that Jim ran into,

96
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:37,220
a man named Tom Star.

97
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,330
The star was a half Cherokee outlaw
who made a living by selling whiskey in

98
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:44,860
Indian territory. A practice which
happened to be a federal crime stall,

99
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:49,100
ran the enterprise with his sons and
they were soon joined by Jim read Jim's

100
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:50,420
foray into the outnet welds.

101
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:53,540
It escalated dramatically when
his brother Scott was murdered.

102
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,340
Jim vowed revenge and hunted down the
killer dispatching both and his brother

103
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,910
Bell, no founder stuff with a husband
who was being hunted by not just the law,

104
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,340
but also the friends of
the man who had killed.

105
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,650
We don't know what he did
that to support the family,

106
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,990
but suspicions are strong that it was
through such nefarious means a stagecoach

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,320
robbery and gambling.

108
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,980
On February the 22nd 1871 bell
gave birth to a second child,

109
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,390
a boy who they named James Edwin
nicknamed Eddie only a month laser.

110
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,460
Jim was accused of accounts of it,
money scam,

111
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,920
and was forced to gains
or relocate his family.

112
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,200
When the La authorities
began looking into his case,

113
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,050
they discovered that he
was also wanted for murder.

114
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,440
Jim Skips down and made us
wear on horseback to Texas
bell and the two children.

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,740
They followed him by stage coach in March,

116
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,540
1871 bell turns up at the family farm
in Texas with to your kids and to wanted

117
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,150
husbands.

118
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,750
Belle's father helped them set up on a
small fan near coon creek and boss county,

119
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,720
but Jim Reed had already
proven that he was no farmer.

120
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,630
Soon the farm was attracting a
regular assignment of vagabonds.

121
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,990
He would sit around with Jim and
plan out their various crimes.

122
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,400
Jim became involved in livestock russling
when he learns that a local man by the

123
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,090
name of Dick Crave,

124
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,920
he had $4,000 in cash stashed at his
home and his brother soul couldn't resist

125
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,150
the temptation.
However,

126
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,020
the robbery was botched and they ended
up murdering craving. A few months later,

127
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,180
the brothers were accused
of murdering another man.

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,650
This man whose last name was wheeler,

129
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:16,010
had apparently reported to the authorities
what he knew about the read mobs,

130
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,460
illegal activities he was
found with his tongue cut out.

131
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,560
This latest outrage resulted in both Jim
and soul having a $500 reward placed on

132
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:28,640
their capture that are alive and is of
course it was time to move. Once again,

133
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,590
leaving the children with bells.
Parents,

134
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,980
the couple of heads headed into Choctaw
Indian territory where the authorities

135
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,010
would be unable to follow them.
Jim was unable to stay out of trouble.

136
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,360
Like on November the 19th 1873
along with two accomplices,

137
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:44,120
he wrote to the farm of a wealthy retired
judge who live near the south Canadian

138
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,380
river,
the judge and his wife.

139
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,340
They were hung from a tree and forced to
divulge the location of the cash in the

140
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,600
house,
the bandits,

141
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,890
they got away with a huge
sum of $30,000 by now.

142
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,020
The strain on the marriage,
it was simply too much.

143
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,890
Mel was fed up with the life of crime
that her husband had forced her into.

144
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,640
She packed up and she took the children
back to the family farm in [inaudible].

145
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,080
Reid's headed for San Antonio where
he took up with a woman named Rosa us.

146
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,810
He continued his outlaw ways,
but fate caught up with him.

147
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:16,430
When the former associate shot him
in the back on August the sixth 1874

148
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,990
bell was now a widow and she had
two young children to take care of.

149
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,240
She stayed on the family
farm with our parents.

150
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,250
In 1876 John Shirley died this Forster
laser to sell the farm and relocate to

151
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,920
Dallas Bowel and the children.
They went with her.

152
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,950
Allegedly Bell was briefly married
for three weeks to Charles,

153
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:43,951
a younger uncle of coal younger in 1878
but this is not substantiated by any

154
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,580
evidence.
It's just a robot.

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,080
On during the fifth 1880 Bell Married Sam
Starve the son of her husband's former

156
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:51,430
associate Tom Star pins.

157
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,150
They settled in the Indian territory
there she learns ways of organizing,

158
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,591
panning,

159
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:59,970
and fencing for the rustlers horse thieves
and bootleggers as well as harboring

160
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,310
them from the law. Uh,
23 the half Cherokee,

161
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:05,100
Sam was nine years younger
than his new bride.

162
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,970
They moved into Cherokee nation
territory and settled into a homestead,

163
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,610
some 760 miles southwest of Fort Smith.

164
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,300
They cleared three acres of land and
planted corn that were plenty of fish in

165
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,790
the nearby river and gain results.
Also Pencil.

166
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,370
It seems like the ideal existence,

167
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:25,320
and it could have been if bells past
hadn't gotten in the way for associates of

168
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:28,530
Jim Reed, they began to learn the battle
had a hideouts in Indian territory,

169
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,600
which was safe from the reach of the law.

170
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,550
So many of these analogs
started showing up.

171
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:36,510
The bell was forced to convert and nearby
cave into a sort of robbers roost with

172
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,300
three log cabins in the interacted.
I've been zone now.

173
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,380
Bell had managed to keep herself from any
actual involvement in illegal activity.

174
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,620
This changed in 1882 when
she and Sam Austin neighbor,

175
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:49,230
if they could put some horses in
his pen a prior to selling them.

176
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,370
The neighbor agreed,

177
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,780
but it's on inspection pointed out that
at least two of the horses belonged to

178
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,990
other local farmers.

179
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,010
Salmon Bell ignored the claims and
went ahead and sold the horses when the

180
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:02,250
original owners of the start and horses
found out, so they press challenges.

181
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,061
Some of Bell,

182
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,270
they were handwritten and indictment to
appear before the court on the charge of

183
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:11,220
larceny. Sam's father Tom, he put up
bail for the couple, both bell and Sam.

184
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,730
They were found guilty. Sam was given a
years prison time in Detroit, Michigan.

185
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,520
Well, Bella was sentenced to
two concurrent, six months,

186
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:21,120
spells at the same facility with their
mother and stepfather in jail that

187
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,120
children were farmed out to
family and friends, Salmon Bell.

188
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,720
They were model prisoners
turning themselves in early
release, often nine months.

189
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,620
They sent a little back,
ends a life on the farm and things.

190
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,310
They were pretty quiet for a few months.

191
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,170
Then in December of 1884 a former
associate of Jim Reed by the name of Jim

192
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,200
Middleton, turns up looking for
a place of refuge from the law.

193
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,840
Middleton was wanted for murder,
runs the law.

194
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,100
They were pretty hot on his trail middles
and hung around the area for several

195
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,821
months.
Then one day,

196
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:51,840
Bellin Sam's ranch was rated by law
enforcement offices from Lamar County.

197
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,560
The offices had received permission from
the Cherokee nation lead is to conduct

198
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:58,560
the rate. Middleton was not
hat the residents at the time,

199
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,680
but the raid scad him enough to
make him want to make a run for it.

200
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,750
But with the law so close on his trail,

201
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,170
he couldn't figure out a way to get
out of the area without being detected.

202
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,520
Bell came to his rescue though,

203
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:12,450
suggesting that she drive a wagon with
the children in tow to visit relatives in

204
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:16,470
Arkadin soul Middleton, which hide
in the wagon God make his getaway.

205
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,660
When they were clear of
prying eyes the plan,

206
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,620
it was working well and then
off to sometime Middleton
was ready to light out on

207
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,310
his own. However, 17 year old pal
refused to let him take a horse.

208
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,860
This led to 14 year old Eddie heading
off to the nearest farm and an attempt to

209
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:33,660
do by a horse. He came back
with a broken down offline map.

210
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,590
It was hardly the ideal
getaway transport about is.

211
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,930
It was all the Middleton Hagins when
he sat out on his own with bells.

212
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:43,210
Colt 45 is only protection five days days.
Uh,

213
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,920
the horse was found in some scrub on
a riverbank not far from Fort Smith.

214
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,390
Then on May the 11th,

215
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,900
1885 Middleton's body was found a
couple of hundred yards downstream.

216
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,630
The authorities soon traced the gun
that was in his holster back to bell.

217
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,410
They also discovered that the horse
they legitimately purchased by Eddie had

218
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:00,700
previously been stolen.

219
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,780
The end result was that bell was
once again up on charges of larceny.

220
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,470
This time around Bella was found not
guilty. However, she returned time.

221
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,770
I need to discover that a husband Sam
had been wounded in a shootout with the

222
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,550
Indian police sound that now become
ensconced in his own life of crime.

223
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,240
Fearful of the rough justice that Indian
police were likely to dish out to.

224
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,390
Bell convinced him to hand himself
in to the federal authorities.

225
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,160
Sam was indicted for trial in February
of 1887 and then released on bail on

226
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,000
December the 17th.

227
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,570
Sam Bell and the children attended a
party at a neighbor's house. Everything.

228
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,410
It was laughter and Merriman's until Frank
West, the local law office, a town job.

229
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,670
He and Sam got into an argument and that
soon devolved into a gun battle in a

230
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,040
minutes.
Both of the men with debt,

231
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,550
Belle Starr was now widowed
for the second time.

232
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,210
Sam's death made possession of the ranch
on Cherokee land. A bit of a problem.

233
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,260
They had not bought the land.

234
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:58,590
It was in their possession because of
Sam's Indian blood. Now that he was dead.

235
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,120
How I've I bells right of possession.

236
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:03,210
It was disputed with pressure mounts
are going to have to get out of Cherokee

237
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,700
territory.
She decided there was another solution.

238
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,480
She married sounds brother
Bill, July ATS, Jim's star,

239
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,780
and we've actually was once again
married to a Cherokee and so she had

240
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:14,220
possession rights to the land.

241
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,700
Now 39 bell was 15 years
older than her third husband.

242
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,170
The marriage of convenience.

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,200
It was not pleasing to Pearl age 19 or
Eddie age 17 both of them constantly

244
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:25,200
argued with Jim,

245
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:29,230
which was a source of ongoing frustration
for bell around this time pole fell in

246
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:33,630
love with a young man who in the course
of time approached bell to Oscar consent

247
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,300
to marry her daughter Bell flatly refused.

248
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,690
Giving the reason that she had long told
pell that she could only marry a man

249
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,860
who had at least $25,000 worth of
property she needs or trying to trick the

250
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:47,130
young men by sending them a letter
with poles forged signature on it,

251
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,130
stating that she had married someone else.
The young couple of though,

252
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,490
they soon figured out the reason,
continued to see each other behind bells.

253
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:57,480
Back before long pellet became
pregnant bell, she was not happy.

254
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,370
You're giving her daughter two options,

255
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,600
have an abortion or never bring the
child into her presence. Pell Chase,

256
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,970
the latter option giving birth
to a girl called philosophy.

257
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,380
On April the 22nd 1887 she took the
babies and live with her paternal

258
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:15,060
grandparents. In 1987 Jim was arrested
for horse theft. By this time,

259
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,730
however,
bell was making an effort to go straight.

260
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,640
She had stopped allowing fugitives
to use a places, a hideouts.

261
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,420
When it came time for Jim's trial,
she refused to assist in his defense.

262
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,180
Meanwhile, young Edie stone
was having his own problems.

263
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,260
He was shots while trying to steal a
horse belt. Fears that he would die.

264
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,740
She sent a message to Paul telling her
that she had better come back to see how

265
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,020
brother for the last time she added,
however,

266
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,040
she was not to bring the baby pillow
returned to see Eddie who recovered from

267
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:41,700
his injury.

268
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,090
Bell put pressure on a daughter to give
up philosophy for adoption during the

269
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:48,780
visit. Po outrightly refused,
but val was a stubborn woman.

270
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,270
She maneuvered things behind the scenes
and philosophy was taken from and placed

271
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:57,440
into an orphanage in November of 1888
I think it was now up on horse theft

272
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,090
charges of his own again,

273
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:02,450
belt refuse to participate in the Defence
Eddie's trial that was scheduled for

274
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:06,380
March of 1889 he returned to the family
homestead and reportedly threatened to

275
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,770
kill his mother.
He then took off never to see belt again.

276
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,610
Bells problems escalated when a couple
of the Watsons turned up at the farm

277
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,180
looking for sharecropping work. Bell
decided to take them up on their offer.

278
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,660
Keens and some extra money. Bell
became quite friendly with Mrs. Watson.

279
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,800
On one occasion.

280
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:24,710
The woman revealed that in a husband's
was as actually wanted for murder.

281
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,060
This scores warning bells in bell's minds
if the Cherokee tribal council found

282
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,160
out that she was again
harboring fugitives,

283
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,380
they would surely kick her off the land.

284
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,010
Bell offered to give the Watsons there
sharecropping feedback and we'll just to

285
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:40,310
get them to leave, but
I'd go Watson. He refused.

286
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,910
It was only when bell revealed that
she knew that Watson was a wanted man,

287
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,600
that he left taking up with his
wife in a nearby tenant. Kevin,

288
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,090
on July the second 1889
bell as a young husband Jim,

289
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,600
they left on horseback to meet Jim's
trial appointments at Fort Smith.

290
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,090
Bells intention was to
accompany them halfway,

291
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,390
pay a debt to the store on King's
creek and then return home.

292
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,570
They stayed the night with friends
and 20 miles from Fort Smith.

293
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,850
The next morning bell town for home while
Jim carried onto the fort bell stopped

294
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,470
off at King's creek.
We actually had lunch at the local store.

295
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,310
Further along the trail, she stops at
the home of a man named Jackson. Wrote.

296
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,850
This was a popular meeting place for
locals. She hoped to see our son Eddie,

297
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:24,900
who had been staying there,

298
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,560
but he left before she arrived
though was Edgar Watson,

299
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:32,220
the sharecropper who forced off
her land as his doorbell arrive.

300
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,760
He promptly left after a short time
eating and conversing with friends.

301
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:40,080
Bell got back on her horse and continued
towards time. However, she never made it.

302
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,870
She was blasted from
ours by a shotgun blast.

303
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,160
The killer then approach the dying figure
on the grounds and blustered again,

304
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,560
bells panic, toss it. Gallup's for home.

305
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,900
That concern to pal set
out to find her mother.

306
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,640
At the time she got to the murder site,

307
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,750
a young boy had already found the
body bell mistaken to a farmhouse,

308
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,613
barely alive.

309
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,360
Pell was just in time to be alongside
the moment that her mother took her last

310
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:03,960
breath.

311
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,490
The question of who killed Belle Starr
has intrigued historians for well over a

312
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,340
century.
Both of our children have been suspects.

313
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,670
Eddie has threatened his
mother at least one selfish.

314
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,140
She had disciplines in with a bullwhip
that the most likely candidates is they'd

315
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:19,290
go Watson. Watson was actually put
on trial for the murder. However,

316
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,380
the evidence was deemed as
circumstantial and he was acquitted.

317
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,830
He eventually returned to Florida where
he was killed in a shootout with a posse.

318
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,850
No other efforts were ever made to
track down the killer of Bell Star.

319
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,280
There were several other
potential suspects besides Watson,

320
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,050
including July himself,
and I don't really,

321
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,970
July had been caught with
the young Cherokee girl.

322
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:40,200
End Bell had been making his life hell
just a few weeks after bell's death.

323
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:43,440
July was mortally wounded by a deputy.
It was on his trail,

324
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,500
so the facts of bell's does
life not exactly as exciting
or as outlandish as the

325
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,230
fictionalized version that began
with a dime novel, Belle Starr,

326
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:57,231
the bandit queen or the female Jesse
James in 1889 in summarizing how life or a

327
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:01,170
Fort Smith Elevator report there about
a year before her death, Bell said,

328
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,770
I regard myself as a woman
who has seen much of life.

329
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,800
The reality was that she was
not the female Jesse James.

330
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,960
She wasn't even a bandit queen.

331
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,610
What she was was a twice widowed woman
with two children who did what she could

332
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,030
to survive.
Only today to be shot down in cold blood.

333
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,650
This is a story of hardship and
tragedy in the real old west,

334
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,880
her grave site,
isn't it?

335
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,360
If our naked Oklahoma or horse
was engraved on our tombstone,

336
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,620
along with these words shed not
for her, the bitter tier, no,

337
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,210
give the heart to then regress.
Tis, but the casket that lies here,

338
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,860
the gem that filled it sparkles yet,
so I already have you found in that video.
