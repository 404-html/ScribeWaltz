1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,030
He is the most bankable star in Hollywood
and action hero with a massive ripped

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:09,860
physique who has impeccable comedic timing
and a never ending supply of charm is

3
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:13,490
also one of the greatest
wrestling superstars to ever
emerge from the stables of

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:17,840
the wwe and the only third
generation wrestling star in history.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,910
The story of Dwayne Johnson,

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,130
the rock is a tale of dedication,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,890
gris and old fashioned hard work.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,510
In this week's biographics,

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,240
we chart the rise and the rise of 2016,

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,760
the sexiest man alive.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,900
Dwayne Johnson,

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,340
Wayne Douglas Johnson was born on May,

13
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:52,180
the second 19,

14
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,770
72 in Haywood county,

15
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:54,604
California.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,630
His mother after was Samoan origin
while his father wade was a black Nova

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Scotian Wade's ends living
as a professional wrestler
under the name of Rocky

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,360
Johnson.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,450
To further entrenched the
wrestling gene in his blood.

20
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,770
Dwayne's maternal grandfather also
had been a professional wrestler,

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,350
promoted as high chief Peter Maivia.

22
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,650
He was the first simone wrestler
to break into the big time.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,610
A generation later rocky became the
first black champions who conquered the

24
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,810
state wrestling scene.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,930
Rocky hustled as a wrestler
taking on bouts web ever.

26
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,820
He could in order to support his family,

27
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,090
times were tough with the family moving
from state to state in order to keep

28
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,530
pace with the wrestling venues.

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,071
In fact,

30
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,450
during Dwayne's formative years,

31
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:39,190
the family of three lived in 38 of the
50 states as they became entrenched in

32
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,170
the gypsy wrestling lifestyle.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
The only time Dwayne got to see his dad
was when he went on the road with him.

34
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,760
He cherished these times and quickly
fell in love with everything to do with

35
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:49,930
professional wrestling.

36
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,120
His Dad taught him some basic moves,

37
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,190
including the sleeper hold when he was 11.

38
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:55,750
Dwayne was playing wrestling one school,

39
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,201
lunchtime.

40
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:56,710
When you put the,

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:56,950
uh,

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,030
hold on a classmate,

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,160
the kids immediately parsed out.

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,210
Unfortunately,

45
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,420
rocky had him showing his son how to
bring someone out of the sleeper hold.

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,840
The ambulance and the police were called
and rocky has to come down to revive

47
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:08,530
the students.

48
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,510
The Johnson House became
a hangouts for Dwayne.

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,260
Schoolmates knew that they were going
to have to do several rounds with their

50
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,950
host.

51
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,460
Dwayne would turn these events into
mock TV shows where he would pretend to

52
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,510
interview the restless.

53
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,090
He would even interview himself
as he portrayed the bad guy.

54
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,110
His chairmanship was immediately
evidence as he came out with all sorts of

55
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:29,640
outrageous pronouncements
against his intended victims do.

56
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,780
I excelled in a number
of sports physically.

57
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,520
He was miles ahead of his classmates.

58
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,830
He had his first weight
workouts when he was 13.

59
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,460
He had been tagging along with his down
to the gym since he was five years old,

60
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,510
as he sounds quietly on a bench and
watched proudly as rocky pounded out pset

61
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,400
after pset with Gargantuan weights.

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,660
Dwayne breathed in the gym atmosphere
and marveled at the sight of huge men

63
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:53,250
doing seemingly impossible things
with massive loads of iron.

64
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,890
While other deans took their
kids to the playgrounds at rocky,

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,110
took Dwayne to most of the
hardcore gyms in the country.

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,730
It was here that the future superstar
learns that there was no replacement for

67
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,280
pure gut wrenching hard work.

68
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,211
At the age of age,

69
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:19,610
rocky allowed Dwayne to
participate in sports.

70
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,451
He tried baseball,

71
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:20,870
soccer,

72
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,561
martial arts,

73
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:22,430
and gymnastics.

74
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,230
What he really longed
to do is lift weights,

75
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:27,020
but it'd have to wait a few
more years to get into that.

76
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,771
Finally,

77
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,120
on his 13th birthday,

78
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,710
his dad took him to a local gym for his
first ever weights workouts and obvious

79
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,420
place to start was the bench press,

80
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,540
which had studied for years as his dad's.

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,230
Now this Preston,

82
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,190
massive amounts of steel from their chest.

83
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,340
Rocky had his son start
with an unloaded bb.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,800
He pumped out 10 reps with no problem,

85
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,080
so rocky added a 20 lbs plates to eat.

86
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,740
Jens.

87
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,620
This time dwayne pushed
out eight easy wraps,

88
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,191
impressed,

89
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:52,431
rocky,

90
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:55,280
asked his son if he wanted
to try the 45 pounders.

91
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,570
Dwayne nodded his head,

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,780
his dad stood behind him and
lifted the bar off the supports,

93
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,290
and Dwayne got buried
under the 135 pound weight.

94
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,950
He felt embarrassed and ashamed
as if he had let his dad down.

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,160
That feeling fueled and intense desire
to get better at the bench press.

96
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:15,050
And within a few years he would be
benching 400 pounds between the ages of 14

97
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:15,740
and 15.

98
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,360
Dwayne excelled in the gym.

99
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,620
By the time you entered high school,

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,680
he had grown it to a towering six foot
three inches and tip the scale at 225

101
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,970
pounds is imposing physicality,

102
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,490
gave him a great deal of self confidence,

103
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,440
which sometimes bordering on arrogance,

104
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,160
but his unstable home life that of
his father constantly traveling,

105
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,250
left him directionless when he
wasn't pounding the weights.

106
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,450
As a result of this,

107
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,920
he started to get into trouble.

108
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,490
It came to a head when he was 15
and he got arrested for check fraud.

109
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,670
His parents had to come and collect them
from the police station when he looked

110
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:50,390
at his mother and father and he realized
that despite living from paycheck to

111
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,020
paycheck,

112
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,660
he was the biggest source
of stress in their lives.

113
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,680
In that moment,

114
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,860
he vowed that he would never cause
problem for his parents again.

115
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,080
Although that was the last
time that Dwayne got arrested.

116
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:03,560
It wasn't the last time he caused worry
for rocky and data and facts of that

117
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:04,520
very next day at school.

118
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,800
He goes into a fight and it's
knocks the other kid out.

119
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,900
It sounds in a two week suspension.

120
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,040
Upon returning to school,

121
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,400
he decided that the students bathrooms
was not good enough for him and so we

122
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,630
decided to use the teachers.

123
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:15,860
One when asked to leave,

124
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,980
he was rude to the teacher and trying
to intimidate him with his physical

125
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:19,670
presence.

126
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,910
That Nice Dwayne felt pangs of guilt
at the way he had treated the teacher,

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,690
so the next day he marched into the
deepest class and holding out his hand,

128
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,240
said that he wanted to apologize
for the way he had acted.

129
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,200
The day before the teacher stared at
Dwayne's hand for a moment and then grabs

130
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:37,210
this and told Wayne that he appreciated
the apology then still holding the boy's

131
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,044
hand and he said,

132
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,680
I want you to play football for me.

133
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,620
Football proof to be a positive
outlet for Dwayne's frustrations and

134
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,221
aggressions.

135
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:58,770
Providing him with a renewed sense of
focus under the eye of coach Judy Swick.

136
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,360
He steadily improved both as
students and as an athlete,

137
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,250
but at the time he was
a high school senior.

138
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,330
He was ranked as one of the
top 10 defensive tackles
in the country and it was

139
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,120
offered a scholarship to
the University of Miami.

140
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,350
The number one college team in the United
States that Miami Dwayne's combination

141
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:15,950
of size,

142
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,491
strength,

143
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:19,280
and athleticism coupled
with his strong work ethic,

144
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,350
makes him a standout
from the very beginning.

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,100
Practice was going great and he was
primed to be the only freshman on the

146
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,970
varsity team,

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,690
but then tragedy struck on the
last day of practice with pads.

148
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,390
He crushed the grounds with his
full weight on his shoulder.

149
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,840
It was dislocated and the number
of ligaments were torn that night.

150
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,980
He had reconstructive surgery and was
told that it need a year to recover.

151
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,220
He was not able to play before
the season had even begun.

152
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,000
Dwayne,

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,850
he fell into a deep depression and
not even bothering to go to class.

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,760
Then without even attempting
and eve as midterms.

155
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,830
He hopped on a flight and returned home,

156
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,240
which at that time was in Tampa,

157
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:53,870
Florida.

158
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,720
After a couple of weeks,

159
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:56,480
he got a call from Miami's head coach,

160
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,410
Dennis Erickson.

161
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,640
He told Duane that he wants to be back
at school in two days because he wants

162
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,450
you to talk to him when they mess up.

163
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,130
Erickson was furious with Johnson.

164
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,150
He told him that he had embarrassed
himself and the team Erickson had trusted

165
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:11,690
him with a position of responsibility
and leadership and he had completely let

166
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,350
him down.

167
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,290
Ericsson then placed Dwayne
onto academic probation.

168
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,940
He was to attend every class,

169
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,990
every practice,

170
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,600
and every game simply
sitting on the sideline.

171
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,250
However,

172
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,580
to get it into daily practice,

173
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,390
he had to get the signatures of every
one of his professors attesting that he

174
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,740
had been to class that day.

175
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,633
If he didn't,

176
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,930
he would lose his scholarship.

177
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,080
Dwayne dug deep and did
what had to be done.

178
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,980
He eventually became academic captain
in his junior year and was preseason all

179
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:37,810
American.

180
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,360
He graduated from Miami University in
Nineteen Ninety five with a bachelor of

181
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,790
general studies and
criminology and physiology.

182
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,270
It was at the University of Miami
that Dwayne first met Danny Garcia,

183
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,260
his future wife.

184
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,860
They were married in 1997
and divorced 10 years later.

185
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,630
After a years injury recovery,

186
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,900
Dwayne wasn't quite as fast or mobile
as he was on the football field.

187
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,890
He was taken from the team and replaced
by Warren Sapp after graduation from

188
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:01,460
Miami.

189
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:01,791
Dwayne,

190
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,451
when to Calgary.

191
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:05,450
Canada is a practice squad
player for the stampeders.

192
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,250
Things were tough am in Canada.

193
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,830
You had hardly any money
and very few prospects,

194
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,180
but things got worse when he
was cut from the stampede.

195
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:14,360
A squad after just two months

196
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,140
arriving back at his parents'
tiny apartments in Tampa,

197
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,330
Dwayne was now at rock bottom.

198
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,350
It his football career,

199
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,730
whereas effectively over at do,

200
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,350
you needed to look in another direction.

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,580
He thought deeply and realized that his
life and his passion had always been

202
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,750
professional wrestling.

203
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,310
If he never turned his hand to it,

204
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,540
he would ever be unfulfilled and if
he was going to step into that wells,

205
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,220
well now is the time.

206
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,090
His mother runs.

207
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,090
Girlfriends encouraged him to go for it,

208
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:51,620
but Dwayne's dad had major reservations.

209
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,950
Rocky knew firsthand just how tough the
life of wrestler was and he wanted more

210
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:56,710
for his son,

211
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,590
but he vowed to stands behind his son.

212
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,520
So long as he put in 110 percent
effort into becoming successful.

213
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,220
Rocky now became Dwayne's
fulltime wrestling coach.

214
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,143
From the start though,

215
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,580
he talks him much more than
simple wrestling moves.

216
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,350
He taught him how to be a showman.

217
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,150
After a few months of intensive work,

218
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,460
rocky felt his son was
ready to take the next step.

219
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,250
He goes in touch with a former
wrestler named Pat Patterson,

220
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,730
who was now a talent agents.

221
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,810
Patterson came to check out what's
Dwayne looks like in the ring,

222
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,620
impressed.

223
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,990
He arranged for a signing with the wwe.

224
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,220
Dwayne was put into the minor leagues
and it was given the name rocky Maivia in

225
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,560
homage to both his father
and his grandfather.

226
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,680
He started wrestling and
smaller arenas for $20 a pop,

227
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,870
but it didn't take long
before he got his break.

228
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,930
The 1996 wwe survivor series was televised
live on tv from Madison Square Garden

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,210
and to the new kids on the
block was rocky Maivia.

230
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,190
He made an immediate
impression establishing
himself as a rising wwe star by

231
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,840
becoming the last man standing.

232
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,200
Rocky took on a charismatic
in your face persona,

233
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,910
which proved to be too loud and too
arrogant for many diehard wwe fans.

234
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,500
His character was rejected for being too
tacky and fans came to see rocky Maivia

235
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,630
as an extremely unlikable character.

236
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,411
When he wrestled,

237
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,450
the stadium would be listed with signs,

238
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,180
reading rocky socks and a die rocky die,

239
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,390
but his perseverance and the
constant refining of his character.

240
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,320
Eventually one of the fans over fans
getting to appreciate the much of rocky's

241
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:19,981
narcissism,

242
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,090
was tongue in cheek,

243
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,950
much in the mold of Muhammad Ali,

244
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,520
and they began to enjoy his over the
top sense of humor when he shortened his

245
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:27,420
name to with the rock.

246
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,251
Fans embraced this,

247
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,540
and within a year he had
transformed the wrestler.

248
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,940
Everyone loves to hate
to the People's champ

249
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,360
from 1997 and 1998.

250
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,540
So the rock had ongoing battles
with stone cold Steve Austin,

251
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,480
triple h and mankind's throughout 1999,

252
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:55,620
the wwe championship belts pause between
the Rock and mankind several times

253
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,360
during a series of epic encounters.

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,160
Then towards the end of 99,

255
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,110
the two team dumped it,

256
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:04,230
become the rock and socket connection
and went on to win the tag team

257
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:09,120
championship three times the Rock and
mankind also performed comedy skits on wwe

258
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,170
live telecasts.

259
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,220
One of them was a take of this is your
life in which mankind interviewed people

260
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:17,520
from the rocks past the segment drew
in eight point four Nielsen Rating,

261
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,720
one of the highest ever
for a wwe segments in 2011.

262
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,680
Though the Rock was
suspended indefinitely.

263
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,050
During the airing of raw is war.

264
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,070
He used the suspension as an opportunity
to move into the action and Rena still,

265
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,610
he would return again and again
to the wrestling ring in 2011.

266
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,020
He was the host of Wrestlemania.

267
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,420
He spent a large part
of the promo buildup,

268
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,570
insulting and taunting John Cena,

269
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,190
who he had already been
calling out on social media.

270
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,600
A few develops between the two,

271
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,460
which continued for another two years.

272
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,680
When he finally stepped away
from the wrestling ring.

273
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:47,910
In 2016,

274
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,810
the rocket established himself as one
of the great pro wrestlers of all time.

275
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Hulk Hogan himself dominating wwe figure
refer to him as the biggest superstar

276
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,600
in the business of sentiments,

277
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,200
which was echoed by John [inaudible].

278
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,800
One of his many catchphrases.

279
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,710
Lay the smack down,

280
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,540
inspired the title of televisions.

281
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,920
Second longest running series smack down
the rock is also entrenched himself in

282
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,390
the wwe record books.

283
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,480
He was the first wrestler to win the WWF
wwe championship seven times and it's

284
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,140
intercontinental championship reign of
265 days is the longest in the modern

285
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:20,974
era.

286
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,540
Dwayne's huge popularity as a wwe
character allows him to crossover into

287
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,650
mainstream media.

288
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,120
His first acting job was in the 1999
episode of that seventies show in which he

289
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:44,960
played his own father in 2010 period
and star Trek Voyager isn't alien.

290
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:45,680
Wrestler,

291
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,730
his first movie appearance was a small
role in 2000 and one's the mummy returns.

292
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,300
The movie was a smash hit leading
to a reprisal of this role.

293
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,160
This time as the lead in the movie,

294
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,390
the Scorpion King Johnson was paid
five point $5,000,000 in that role,

295
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,470
ending in a spot in the Guinness Book of
Records as the highest paid actor in a

296
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,140
debut disliked it actually
being his second movie.

297
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,980
This movie established Johnson as a
bonafide star with his comedy credentials,

298
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,930
clearly established through
his wrestling career,

299
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,771
his next film,

300
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,461
the action comedy,

301
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,680
that rundown was the natural next step.

302
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,410
This was followed with a
remake movie walking tool.

303
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,970
This role cemented Johnson's position as
the ultimate hard as nails action hero

304
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,400
with a heart of gold
over the next few years.

305
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:30,080
Dwayne skip between comedies and action
movies with such films as be cool doom

306
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,060
to theory of film,

307
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,100
which was originally written
for one of the rocks heroes,

308
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,130
Arnold Schwartzenegger,

309
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,080
and the fast and the furious.

310
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,160
His debut in the foster and the furious
came in the fifth movie after fans

311
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:43,070
demanded to see a showdown
between Johnson and vin diesel.

312
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,850
The movie was the most successful
in the entire franchise,

313
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,360
making more than $86,000,000
