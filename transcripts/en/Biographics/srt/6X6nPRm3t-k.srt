1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,390
There have been many brilliant
minds who have lent their talents,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,340
the committing and the solving of crime,

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:10,341
but none stands as supremely as that
of Sherlock Holmes with is unequaled.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,540
Powers of reasoning deduction
and scientific application
homes was able to solve

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:20,130
the cases that are baffled the best of
Scotland Yard with his tweed suit cloth

6
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,780
cap and his black clay pipe.

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,350
The world's greatest sleuth has become
familiar to a new generation through

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:29,680
television and movie adaptations of
his many adventures in this week's by

9
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:30,090
graphics.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,090
We have dug deep to uncover the private
world of the notoriously secretive Mr

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,820
Sherlock Holmes may well have been the
greatest detective living or dead is to

12
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:50,350
investigate the criminal minds,

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,840
but he was an extremely private genius
as a result of the study of his early

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,220
years as an exercise in
frustration for biographies.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,000
On one of the few occasions that he
did open up about his family origins.

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,250
He mentioned to his ever loyal sidekick,

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,113
James Watson,

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,680
that his ancestors were country squires
who up here to have that much the same

19
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,410
life as it's natural to
people of that class.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,510
He also revealed that his
grandmother was the sister of Mlg,

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,550
Horace Vernay,

22
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,940
the renowned French artist who
specialized in the military paintings.

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,060
His final familiar revelation
was that he had an older brother,

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,840
Mycroft,

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,250
who according to show lock in self
possessed even greater powers of deduction

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,233
than he did.

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,190
Apart from those few tidbits,

28
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,070
we are left to work out
the details of homes,

29
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:36,970
his early life from circumstantial
evidence and deduction.

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,640
Something of a coincidence I might think.

31
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,750
Holmes was born and raised in the
county of Sussex on the south coast of

32
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:44,290
England.

33
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,240
The homeless family seat was that Linford,

34
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,210
a few miles from portion sherlock's.

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,700
Father,

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,410
a gentleman named roderick
homes was born around 18,

37
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,170
15.

38
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,400
Roderick was a man's man who delighted
in such outdoor pursuits as fox hunting,

39
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,180
trout fishing and pheasant shooting
in sharp contrast to his two sons.

40
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:04,420
He didn't put much credence in book
learning and affairs of the minds.

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,200
Shallock's mother was 13 years
younger than her husband's Charlotte.

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,910
Aircraft came from Lancashire,

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,450
but origins were French from her
mother's to see all their names.

44
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,730
She inherited not only artistic leanings,

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,610
but a flighty self-absorbed personality.

46
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,451
The marriage,

47
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,420
it was not a happy one,

48
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,360
and with such disparate personalities,

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,310
it could be said that it
was doomed from the start.

50
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,110
Their first child was born in 18,

51
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:29,680
46 and given the name
of John Microsoft homes,

52
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,850
the name gives us an insight into the
state of the parent's mental processes.

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,430
Roderick hated his own name and wanted
to give his firstborn son a plane on

54
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,340
complicated name,

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,500
but Charlotte has quite the opposite view.

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,150
She wanted to name that was different,

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,800
striking and memorable.

58
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,520
Of course,

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,370
Roderick one,

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,650
Charlotte managed to squeeze her choice
and Amalgam of possessive nature,

61
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,850
my with the last syllable of her maiden
name cropped in as a middle name.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,570
It was only because he spends more of
his formative years around his possessive

63
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:03,010
mother that the boy came to be known
as Mycroft a name which grated on his

64
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,610
father.

65
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,780
Every time he heard it,

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,770
it took Roderick and Charlotte seven
years to produce another child's no

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
surprise considering the
deteriorating state of their union.

68
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,611
By now,

69
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:17,050
roderick has given up entirely on trying
to control his wife's autistic or as he

70
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:18,640
sort irrational site.

71
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,330
He left anything up to her and she even
out did a creativity the first time

72
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:22,960
around,

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,490
she named a second son,

74
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,450
Sherlock.

75
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,900
The name wasn't entirely her own
invention in order to escape from the

76
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,170
increasing abuse of our husbands who
had taken more and more to the bottle,

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,280
she began making trips to London where
she would visit art galleries and theater

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,143
performances.

79
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,100
She became enamored with a father and son,

80
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,510
pair of English artists,

81
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,080
both who were named William Sherlock in
the hopes that our seconds would prove

82
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,100
to be a great artist.

83
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,110
She gave him the Monica Sherlock

84
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,370
was the customer of the day to
send sons away to boarding school.

85
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,590
Roderick didn't believe
in higher education,

86
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,380
and so the two brothers
endured a succession of tutors,

87
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,490
some of whom were good,

88
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,900
while others were terrible,

89
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,460
even when they did have a good teacher.

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:03,790
Now,

91
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,050
volatile environments cost by the parents
losing for one another did not make

92
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,460
for conductive learning.

93
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,230
However,

94
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,790
Microsoft and sherlock
educated themselves,

95
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,320
despite their environments,

96
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,230
it seemed became apparent
that both boys were brilliant.

97
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,250
Sherlock instantly fell in love with
books later referring to himself as an

98
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,330
omnivorous reader.

99
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,110
His brother,

100
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,770
meanwhile,

101
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,030
was obsessed with numbers even though
there was a seven year gap in age,

102
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,430
the two boys were extraordinarily close.

103
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,820
They drew up on each other for mutual
support and mental stimulation,

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,761
Microsoft periods,

105
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:35,650
or an overweight child.

106
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,500
You avoided any type of
exercise or physical exertion.

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
Instead in his early teens,

108
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,850
he became fascinated with
electricity and chemistry.

109
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,340
This soon caught the attention
of his younger brother.

110
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,620
He began saving as pocket money to
buy scientific Kratos shut look,

111
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,580
escapes the unpleasant
environments at home.

112
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,130
By finding interests outside the house,

113
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,250
he developed a friendship with a man who
was in charge of his father's hunting

114
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:57,790
house.

115
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,500
This man named Sherman was a taxidermist
and shell expense many hours watching

116
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,170
him at work.

117
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,190
The boy also spends a lot of
time in his father's stables.

118
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,430
Rate.

119
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,470
Develops a great acquiring knowledge.

120
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,483
Unlike his brother,

121
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:09,970
Sherlock,

122
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,900
enjoyed sports.

123
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,250
He became a talented young boxer winning
a number of matches against local boys.

124
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,761
Roderick,

125
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,020
during his sober periods,

126
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,010
tried his best,

127
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,190
send the boys into country.

128
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:19,900
Squire's,

129
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,900
though they both became possible
shots with fouling pieces.

130
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,600
Neither of them had any
stomach for fox hunting.

131
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,320
Furthermore,

132
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,180
Mycroft was a poor horse rider.

133
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,050
One Constellation for Roderick though
was that they both took to fishing.

134
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,100
What they really relished was the
consultative nature of the activity,

135
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,430
which provided plenty of
time for planning overall.

136
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:39,910
However,

137
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,520
Roderick was disappointed in
how his sons were turning out,

138
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,520
unsurprisingly then he very
rarely showed them any affection,

139
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,840
preferring to cast aspirations on their
manhood and their physical prowess.

140
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,070
This lack of physical display was more
than compensated for by Charlotte who

141
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:57,310
would shower the boys with hugs
and kisses at every opportunity.

142
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,730
This only served to further strengthen
roderick's conviction that he had raised

143
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,340
a couple of cities when
our sons were old enough.

144
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,360
Charlotte took them to London where she
introduced them to concerts and opera

145
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,540
and guided them through the picture
galleries of the metropolis.

146
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,190
The brothers found out chatter,

147
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,100
tiresome and their behavior
sometimes embarrassing,

148
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,980
but they were grateful to
get away from their father.

149
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,660
As a result of these London visits,

150
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,940
shallow developed a strong love of music.

151
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,580
This inspired Charlotte to hire
a violin teacher for the boy,

152
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,560
but the lessons they didn't last long.

153
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,180
When Roderick found out about it,

154
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,050
he put an immediate stop to the lessons
Mycroft and Charlotte Gossett and spends

155
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,940
a lot of time with other
boys in the community.

156
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,430
They found them not to be up
to their intellectual level,

157
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,650
and so I've spent most
of their time together.

158
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,190
However,

159
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,750
they did make one great friends and
that would be Charles Edward Howard.

160
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,850
Vincent Charles was the son of Sir
Frederick Vincent Rector of the parish of

161
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:50,510
slim fit.

162
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,880
This boy was just as
brilliant as the homes boys.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,690
He was sent off to boarding school at age
12 that spends most of his time during

164
00:06:56,691 --> 00:07:00,140
the school vacations in the company of
Mycroft and Sherlock Charles Howard.

165
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,410
Vincent winds onto four j
distinguished multifaceted Korea,

166
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,130
which fills two pages in Britain's
dictionary of national biography.

167
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,180
Roderick refused to send his oldest son
to university when Microsoft reached the

168
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,014
age of 20,

169
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,560
but by now the older brother had enough
of his father's abusive ways and team

170
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,950
moved to London where he secured a
position as an assistant to a member of

171
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:19,784
parliaments.

172
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,260
When his brother moved away.

173
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,180
Sherlock was 13 years of age.

174
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,840
He spent an unhappy few years as
a loner in an unhappy household,

175
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,620
is only bright spots being the regular
letters that he received from his brother

176
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,170
in London and surprisingly at age 18,

177
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,990
Sharla convinced his father to
send them to Cambridge University.

178
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,460
During his first semester,

179
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,350
he was invited by a fellow students by
the name of Victor Trevor to spends the

180
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,590
vacation with him that his family's
estate and Norfolk not jeans.

181
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,220
You returned to his fueling parents.

182
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,130
He gladly accepted the
invitation following this visit.

183
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,440
Sherlock did not return
home for future holidays,

184
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,190
but took rooms in London where he
buried himself in chemical research.

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,050
He had his mind set on becoming a chemical
analyst while the university homes

186
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:03,980
played no part in team sports which would
have required cooperation with others.

187
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,760
Instead,

188
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,260
he focused on boxing.

189
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,270
The only friends he had
at college was Victor,

190
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:08,810
trevor,

191
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,930
just as the only friends he
had as an adult was Dr Watson

192
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,210
in the autumn of 18,

193
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:20,210
74 shallow to be on his third
year of study at Cambridge,

194
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,740
but he left before the year was out.

195
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,603
With no degree.

196
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,200
The details have never been revealed,

197
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,630
but it is clear that some
sort of trauma afflicted,

198
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,070
both sherlock and Mycroft during these
months and left psychological wounds on

199
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,820
both of them.

200
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,840
Biographers have speculated that the
situation may have involved members of the

201
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,680
opposite sex.

202
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,680
Dr Watson later shed some
light on the homes mindset.

203
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,720
His aversion to women and
is disinclination to form
new friendships were very

204
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,950
typical of his unemotional character,

205
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,820
but not more so than his complete
suppression of every reference to his own

206
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,540
people.

207
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,710
Homes himself once said,

208
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,070
I am not a whole sold
admirer of womankind.

209
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,780
Women are never to be entirely trusted,

210
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,070
not the best of them.

211
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,790
Despite this homes was always
courteous and considerate to women,

212
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,110
is hostility to the other.

213
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,500
Sex was confined to the
areas of love and marriage,

214
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,860
so whatever the precise
nature of this emotional blow,

215
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,820
it resulted in sherlock being
a lifelong user of narcotics.

216
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,870
This addiction was in sharp contrast to
his temperance and otherwise clean mode

217
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:23,190
of living at the time the use of narcotics
in Britain was neagle still have.

218
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,600
It was alarming to Dr Watson.

219
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,860
He wanted more than one occasion,

220
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,570
tried to reason with the great detective,

221
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,250
but it was a mind of destroying completely
wasteful and individual practice.

222
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,680
Homes usually brushed him
off about it over the years,

223
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,580
but with Watson's help,

224
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,200
he was able to have limited success in
shaking off the habits whether the tragic

225
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,180
events was separate to the death of homes.

226
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,740
As parents is not clear,

227
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,410
those passings surely would have
been horrific in themselves.

228
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
They have in the autumn of 18,

229
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:51,390
74 when Microsoft was in
London and Shallow Cambridge.

230
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,283
On hearing the news,

231
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,510
both boys returned immediately to Sussex.

232
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,400
That father had been killed by a pistol,

233
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,020
shot to the head of their mother,

234
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,980
had been strangled.

235
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,860
The police immediately
ruled out murder suicide,

236
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,200
but Microsoft in sherlock knew better.

237
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,970
A lonely and depressed Charlotte,

238
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,190
but found release in
the arms of another man.

239
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,460
I'm discovering the affair.

240
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:09,781
Roger.

241
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,410
He had strangled his wife in a frenzy
and then stagger to the stables where you

242
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,090
attend the pistol on himself.

243
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,931
The two sons.

244
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:16,850
Did you still have this room,

245
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:20,580
a capital examination of the scene
coupled with that inside knowledge of the

246
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,380
state of their parents' marriage,

247
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,800
the man who had been the subject
of Charlotte's affection,

248
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,280
and therefore the indirect cause of the
tragedy was a man of privilege by the

249
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,750
name of Lord Tap Clinton.

250
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,510
He discretes the left the
area after the deaths,

251
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,660
but his actions left a deep
seated resentments of titles,

252
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,370
men in the heart of Sherlock,

253
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,480
this family tragedy,

254
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,070
his homes at the age of 20.

255
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,220
I left him with a deep seated
business against his mother,

256
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,330
apart from his brother.

257
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,840
She was the only person who had ever
shown him love and affection and from all

258
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,410
of this,

259
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,020
what he decided he needed was
a complete change of scenery

260
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,630
from earliest boyhood.

261
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,300
SHELLAC had been fascinated
with the American west.

262
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,450
They wanted to travel to America
and payers way for some time,

263
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,630
so mycroft advanced him some
money from his father's estate.

264
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,670
He left for the new world in early 18,

265
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,450
75.

266
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,680
When he arrived in New York.

267
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,350
He became fascinated by the
theater scene in Manhattan.

268
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,360
It provided the escape that he needed.

269
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:15,811
In fact,

270
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,750
he loved the scene so much that he
drifted into a theatrical troupe in the

271
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:22,230
autumn of [inaudible] 75 because
Victorian society in America,

272
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,110
as well as in England,

273
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,190
considered acting less than
reputable occupation homes,

274
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,480
chose not to tarnish his family,

275
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:29,310
named by calling himself Mr Sherlock.

276
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,200
After a brief running in Manhattan,

277
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,560
the three went on tour that
took them as far as Chicago.

278
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,710
Those Korea on the American stage
lasted for less than a year.

279
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,850
Homes found the work absorbing and soon
became adept at the professional skills

280
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,140
of makeup and disguise.

281
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,730
Disability benefited him greatly and later
cases where he recreated himself into

282
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:50,610
everything from an Italian
priest to an old woman

283
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,120
to obtain realistic details for the
working class and criminal roles.

284
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:02,080
He played on stage homes ventured into
dangerous neighborhoods in New York and

285
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:02,711
other cities.

286
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,700
That is true visitors.

287
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,530
There's often proved hazardous,

288
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,870
requiring the cooperation
of the local police.

289
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,670
These excursions also gave homes,

290
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,331
contacts,

291
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:13,510
and information that he was able to
draw on during his later professional

292
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,110
career.

293
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,930
As he followed police investigations
in the cities he was touring.

294
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,080
He began to realize the practical
value of the scientific knowledge.

295
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,800
You had gains from his boyhood
experiments and his cambridge education,

296
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,560
bloodstains poisons mud caked on shoes,

297
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,880
liquid left in glasses,

298
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,540
his scientific way of looking at
such as revealed forensic evidence,

299
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,480
which he was able to pass on to
the police for the first time.

300
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,810
He began to seriously consider taking
up detective work professionally.

301
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,230
He imagined himself something
entirely new to the Victorian era,

302
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,670
a scientific detective.

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,880
This motive was to power him
through the rest of his life.

304
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,620
After 18 months of traveling around,

305
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,550
the United States almost decided it was
time to return to the country of his

306
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,050
birth on resends in London.

307
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,900
He founds lodging just around the
corner from the British Museum.

308
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,040
He began running errands for private
detectives carrying out such distasteful

309
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,830
duties as gathering
evidence for divorce cases,

310
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,120
but all the while he was picking up the
basics of detective work to further this

311
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:07,480
work.

312
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,510
He revived his study of science
with a focus on chemistry,

313
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,320
botany,

314
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,490
and anatomy

315
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,820
offer a year also,

316
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,070
Hamza was ready to branch off and
start his own detective agency.

317
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,330
His first cases were domestic and routine
revolving around minus civil disputes.

318
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,120
He walked onto cultivate his
relationship with the police,

319
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,840
passing on information that would
help them crack a case in return.

320
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,660
The police past clients
onto him the year 18,

321
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,120
88 was a fortunate one
for Sherlock Holmes.

322
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,870
Scans will have left the London police
in a situation that then they were open

323
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,470
to the up and coming to tax if the case
which has become known as the musgrave

324
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:48,900
ritual was his first high profile case
establishing his superior powers of

325
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,140
deduction ends for us to investigation
to a fascinated public case.

326
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:55,930
Got underway when Holmes
was cooled by a university,

327
00:13:55,931 --> 00:14:00,010
Acquaintance Reginald Musgrave to have
musgraves domestic staff had disappeared

328
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,340
following their dismissal for
reading a secret family documents,

329
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,940
calls of the musgrave ritual
items not only solve the case,

330
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:11,320
but uncovered the crown of Kenny Charles
the fest which had been missing for 200

331
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:15,310
years as a result of the fame garnered
from the musgrave ritual homes was

332
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:19,240
invited to give a series of lectures
to instruct the newly formed criminal

333
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,590
investigation department.

334
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,420
Won't cid the brilliance.

335
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:26,830
Twenty four year old now found himself
in lightening hard bitten Korea cops on

336
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,610
anatomy,

337
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,080
chemistry and botany.

338
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,591
He also,

339
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:30,020
at this point,

340
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,340
knew enough about geology to
identify soil on clothing and shoes

341
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,070
and

342
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,170
more and more detectives now goes into
the habits of consulting with homes when

343
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,480
they reached an impasse
in their investigations,

344
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,560
even though they hated to admit this,

345
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,390
the young Pii would invariably provide
them with the breakthrough that they

346
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,100
needed in order to crack a case.

347
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,621
In 18,

348
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:55,880
81 homes began lodging with a man who
would become inextricably tied to himself.

349
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,110
Dr John Watson.

350
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,310
The address was two t one b Baker Street
Watson was a young medic who had just

351
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:05,150
returned from Afghanistan and was looking
for a cheap place to live on the first

352
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:05,511
meeting.

353
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:08,480
Once it was fascinated that homes
deduced that he had recently been in

354
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,580
Afghanistan without him having profit.

355
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,880
That information from that
moment on Watson was perks,

356
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,630
fares part home seemed delighted to share
his home with the affable Dr Watson,

357
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,170
the two men would go onto for the
partnership that has been an equals in the

358
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,380
annals of criminal investigation
as same as his reputation grew.

359
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,430
He attracted more and more
affluent clients and was
able to charge higher fees.

360
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,300
These hyphae cases subsidized others in
which he helps people who could only pay

361
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,070
a small fee or no fee at all.

362
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,641
He wants,

363
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:38,720
says that the status of my clients is
of less interest to me than the interest

364
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,680
of his case.

365
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,730
What he was after,

366
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,530
what cases that challenged him.

367
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,140
His greatest challenge came and his
ongoing hunt for London's master criminal

368
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:51,280
Professor Moriarty.

369
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,250
In order to avoid Moriarty's
criminal organization.

370
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,800
Holmes was forced to
flee Europe in late 18,

371
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:57,634
91,

372
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,880
but the criminal masterminds pursued
the great detective and it's a climactic

373
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:01,714
struggle occurred.

374
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,030
Top Theater Reichenbach
falls in Switzerland.

375
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,660
It appears that both men fall to their
death and the funeral is held for the

376
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:09,010
world's greatest detective.

377
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,660
However,

378
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:09,970
homes,

379
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,030
his body was never recovered
and indeed he was not.

380
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,110
Debt for three years,

381
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,370
though he allowed the world,

382
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,400
including Dr Watson to
believe that he was dead.

383
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,900
This period is known by biographers
as the great hiatus in 18,

384
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:23,560
94.

385
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,640
He was suddenly back on
the scene explaining to a
bewildered Dr Watson that he

386
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,640
had faked his death to get
moriarty's henchmen off his back.

387
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,733
Ten years later,

388
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,820
homes retard to a small farm in Sussex
downs where he took up beekeeping in

389
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:40,391
1908.

390
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:44,170
He came out of retirement in order to
aid his governments working as a double

391
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:44,570
agents.

392
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,840
He masterminded the
capture of a German spike.

393
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,470
It is believed he kept
busy with intelligence work
during the first world war.

394
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,200
There is no record of homes
is activities after the war.

395
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,360
So when did Sherlock Holmes die?

396
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,740
The answer is obvious.

397
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,840
Just consider the Plethora of TV shows,

398
00:16:58,841 --> 00:16:59,381
movies,

399
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:03,520
and books on the man and he will surely
agree that Sherlock Holmes had never

400
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:04,210
died,

401
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,710
just as he had never lived.

402
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,670
Sherlock Holmes.

403
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,870
He's a complete work of fiction,

404
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,880
the creation of a writer by
the name of Arthur Conan doyle.

405
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,870
That's if you've spent the last 20 minutes
believing that you are learning the

406
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,370
history of a real life human being,

407
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,290
you're certainly not alone.

408
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,250
In a recent poll,

409
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,060
21 percent of respondents thought that
the greatest sleuth of Baker Street

410
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,500
really did exist,

411
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,460
which just goes to show that sometimes
fiction is stranger than truth.

412
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,530
That's you might notice that this video
is published on April first April fools

413
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:33,364
