8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,690
Queen Victoria Earl's.

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,080
I have a Great Britain for 63 years and
she has still remembered as being one of

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,220
the most influential monarchs in history
when it comes to the life of Queen

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,221
Victoria.

12
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,300
Biographers are actually very lucky
because she wrote journals and letters

13
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,290
documenting her daily life from the
time she was a teenage girl all the way

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,700
through to our death.
Therefore,

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:51,540
we know exactly what she was
experiencing in her own words. However,

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,330
when she was close to death,
she also said doors,

17
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:57,900
a bare trust at edit and rewrite many
of our journals and destroy much of the

18
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,470
original text that might offend
members of our family. After her death,

19
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:04,770
the children took it upon themselves
to burn certain chunks of our life that

20
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,980
they were embarrassed of. Because
of that, we have the image of her.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,630
That's how children wanted us to see who
was known as the widow of Windsor and

22
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,140
spent her entire life mourning the
death of her husbands, but our life.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,350
It was far more interesting than
she's often given credit for

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,950
Victoria.
His grandfather was George the third.

25
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:30,710
He was the reigning King of
England's during a youth.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,240
Pat Father was Prince Edward,

27
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:36,650
the Duke of Kensington Mother Victoria
of sacs called [inaudible] was born in

28
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,080
Germany before she became
the Duchess of Kent.

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,400
Prince Edward would have
become the next king.

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,460
He died when Victoria was very young,

31
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,130
leaving her to be the only
legitimate adds to the throne.

32
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,910
Victoria grew up knowing that one day she
would become the next queen of England.

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,360
By the time women were never
trusted with their own finances.

34
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:56,540
To make matters worse, the Duchess
of Kent, evenly spaced gem and,

35
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,520
but she was expected to
raise an English queen.

36
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,990
So a man named John Conroy was appointed
as the comptroller of the lives of

37
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,080
Victoria and her mother Conan right,

38
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,670
took his duty much further
than just being an accountant.

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,480
He would send opportunists to Seoul this
as a chance to have a powerful position

40
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,820
in the government since pushed for control
over the way Victoria was raised and

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,480
it lots of ways. He became almost
like a talent agents for a child star.

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,630
From an outsider's perspective,
it would seem the young Victoria,

43
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,010
she had the perfect life.

44
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,540
She was raised in the beautiful home of
Kensington Palace with toys clay or the

45
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,810
sevens and vacations broad,
but in a journals.

46
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:36,800
Victoria often wrote that she had a very
unhappy challenge it together with a

47
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,610
mother, Conroy created strict rules
known as the Kensington System.

48
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,660
The main goal of its designed was to make
Victoria Week and completely incapable

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,460
of doing anything on her own.

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,580
She was always in the company of
a chaperone wherever she went.

51
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,630
Instead of going to school,

52
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,930
she had a governess to Zaha and she
was never allowed to play with other

53
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:54,530
children.

54
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,530
This was an extremely lonely knife and
she desperately wants to friends Conroy

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,480
and Victoria's mother. They hopes this
if they broke the princess down enough,

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,590
they could turn it into a puppet that
was easy to control. As a teenager,

57
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,790
Conroy arranged for a tour on a train so
the Victoria could see every major city

58
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,624
in the UK.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,650
She was forced to try and memorize every
single person's name and title at every

60
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:21,400
dinner party. Considering these
dinner parties where massive task,

61
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,020
it was always going to be a failure.

62
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,010
Conroy would reprimand her saying
that she was too stupid to be queen.

63
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,821
Needless to say,

64
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,810
the demands and the constant onslaught
of insults made a completely miserable.

65
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,740
In 1835 she was visiting the town of
Ram's gate and she became very ill with

66
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:40,360
typhoid fever. Conroy accused her
of being lazy and being a liar.

67
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,960
He said that she was faking her illness
in order to get out of the tour,

68
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,040
but she truly was sick and she
was lying in bed in a hotel.

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,730
John Coleman right burst into that hotel
room with a piece of paper and hands.

70
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,840
He said that she would be a horrible
queen and demanded the tree Sinoway have

71
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,050
power to him so that he could
be her personal secretary.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,650
This would have made him king by proxy
because he would have had an absolute

73
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,510
power over all of her affairs.

74
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,830
She was just 16 years old at the time and
she spend her entire life being broken

75
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,930
down to feel completely worthless,

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,990
but she still had the
strength to say no to this.

77
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,400
When she was 18 Victoria was awoken in
the middle of the night by her mother and

78
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:21,010
she learns that her grandfather,
he was dead.

79
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,310
She came downstairs to find
the entrepreneurship of
Canterbury kneeling in front

80
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,000
of her and just like that.
She was the queen of Great Britain.

81
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,500
On the day of Queen Victoria's coronation,
the prime minister, Lord Melbourne,

82
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:41,310
was so moved by the beauty of the
ceremony that he had tears in his eyes.

83
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,390
He congratulated her and told her that
she was going to do a wonderful job.

84
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,640
He looks as high with fatherly pride,

85
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:50,940
which was something that she had
never experienced in her life.

86
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,190
Victoria knew that she could trust him.

87
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,120
The prime minister became a new father
figure, runs her very first friends.

88
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,690
They would spend a lot of time together
doing jigsaw puzzles and taking long

89
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:01,350
walks.

90
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,250
She often wrote that his sense of humor
was her favorite thing about him and

91
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,210
that he would often make her laugh.
However,

92
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,430
in public she was forced
to put on a serious face,

93
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,030
often becoming Queen Victoria moved into
Buckingham Palace and she decided to

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,090
never speak to her mother. All Lord
Conroy again that plans who controller,

95
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,580
it'll completely backfired.

96
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,630
She hated both of them and was glad to
finally have her independence. However,

97
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:25,770
that did not stop Lord Conroy from
continuing to try and slither his way back

98
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,460
into power.

99
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,000
He approached Lord Melbourne claiming
that the queen promised him a pension of

100
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,370
3000 pounds a year as well as a title,

101
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,270
some lands and a seat and caught
Melbourne gave into Conroy's demands.

102
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,350
After hearing about his line is
Victoria at dismissed board corn Rye,

103
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:43,410
but he continued to work for the Duchess
of Ken's while they plotted the next

104
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:47,310
move when Lord Melbourne's time is prime
minister was over and he was voted out

105
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,740
of office Victoria.
She was devastated.

106
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,760
She wrote a mounted in a journals with
so much drama or is it was almost as if

107
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:56,600
he had died. Robert Peale became
the next prime minister. Runt.

108
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,260
He treats head like a stupid girl,
just like John Conroy hat.

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,390
He was part of the Tory,
but as a grill party.

110
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:06,110
So he demanded the Victoria dismiss
her ladies in waiting because they were

111
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:09,170
members of the Whig party,
Victoria's bed chamber maids.

112
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,250
They were her dearest friends.

113
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,180
So she was outraged at the suggestion
that she should follow them over politics.

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,080
She flat out refused to continue
to obey peels orders after all,

115
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,470
she was the queen, so he didn't really
have any rights to make demands of her.

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Robert Hill was so frustrated that
he could not control it. There's,

117
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,450
he actually resigned from
being prime minister.

118
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,240
This incident became known
as the bedchamber crisis.

119
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,283
Okay.

120
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,550
Even though Victoria's
mother and John Conroy,

121
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,290
we're no longer on
speaking terms with her.

122
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,740
They were still trying to give more
power to the German part of the family.

123
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,140
They're instructed Prince Albert's,
her first cousin.

124
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,460
It's a quarter with the plots to get
their family more control over the throne.

125
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,450
Victoria had only met Alberto ones
before and by the time they were both 20

126
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:56,180
years old, she was shocked at
how handsome had grown up to be.

127
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,080
She ran home so rice in her journal
about how attractive he was and how her

128
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:03,860
heart was pounding. Victoria had
no idea that her mother had plans.

129
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,690
This clandestine meeting
with Albert's Miss.

130
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,910
They truly did fall in
love with one another.

131
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,270
She was head over heels
in love and as the Queen,

132
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,480
she was the one to ask Albert
to marry her in her diary.

133
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:17,930
There are so many intimate details about
their honeymoon and it might as well be

134
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,980
a romance novel. Victoria at became
pregnant just a month after our wedding.

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,410
She was in constant
pain and very hormonal.

136
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,130
She struggled a lot with pregnancy and
she was extremely critical of herself

137
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,630
falling into a serious depression.

138
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:33,380
Victoria would write in a diary about
how guilty she felt every time she lost

139
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,010
her temper.

140
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,910
She would often writes that her husband
was perfect since she hated herself for

141
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:41,720
being anything but sweet and so
loving towards him at all times.

142
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,800
Little did the queen.
No,

143
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,450
this was all parts of an extension of
Conroy and the Duchess of Kent Kensington

144
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:47,790
Plan.

145
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,380
Allbirds German family instructed him
to keep getting her pregnant so that she

146
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:55,340
would remain a week and never have time
to truly learn how to rule on her own.

147
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,290
She rode the pregnancy,
made a miserable,

148
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,380
but they had a total of nine
children together. Unfortunately,

149
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,540
Victoria did not like her kids very much.

150
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,380
Motherhood's it was simply something she
was not ready for and she suffered from

151
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,840
a lot of postpartum depression
for all of those years.

152
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,960
She stated she had a lowness
and the tendency to cry.

153
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,130
It is what every lady suffers with
moral less what I during my first

154
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,010
confinements suffered dreadfully with.
All right,

155
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,980
so Victoria is life is about to get a
whole lot more tragic and I mean I don't

156
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,890
want to buy a graphics video
be without plenty of tragedy,

157
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:25,970
but before we get into that,

158
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,900
let me take a moment to tell you about
Squarespace who make these long videos

159
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:33,920
possible. Squarespace, it
empowers dreamers, makers do us.

160
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,210
I really liked that ad copy.

161
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,780
It gives them the tools to bring
their creative ideas to life.

162
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,400
Squarespace and get easy to,

163
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:44,150
they have an all in one platform so you
can claim a domain dollar website and

164
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,320
even sell on line.

165
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,070
There's no fussing around is getting that
domain from one website bringing into

166
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,560
another working out how to
sell something or whatever.

167
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,470
It's all neat and tidy on Squarespace
in. Thanks. I've got a personal here,

168
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,450
I'm working on a website
with them right now.

169
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,840
I have the domain bought it somewhere
else. Had to transfer it over.

170
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,840
It was relatively easy with Squarespace
but just by your end Janine on

171
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,210
Squarespace and trust me
and that would be easier.

172
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,300
Plus that website you make not
going to look too shabby either.

173
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,460
And by that I mean it's
going to look amazing.

174
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,020
They've got award winning templates,

the and and customize it to your heart's

sketch and that tragedy shall we.

185
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,040
In the year 1861 queen
Victoria's mother died of cancer.

186
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,590
Despite all the drama that had
gone on between the two of them,

187
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,020
she regretted not spending
more time with a mother.

188
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,740
She realized that John Conroy was the
true villain here and she regretted not

189
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:13,400
taking action to repair
their relationships sooner.
That same year though,

190
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,470
her husband Albert,
he also died.

191
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,370
She was 42 years old and suddenly
the closest people in their life,

192
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,200
they were gone after his death.

193
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:24,980
She continued to sleep next to a picture
of him and have the sevens lay out his

194
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:28,790
clothes on the bed every
morning even though he wouldn't
be there to get dressed.

195
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,820
Whenever someone asked her to make a
decision, she would accidentally say,

196
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,680
I'll have to ask Albert's as her.

197
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,280
She had forgotten or was in
denial about his death. Victoria,

198
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:40,160
she already struggles with mental illness,
but these deaths,

199
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,750
they made it follow us.

200
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,260
They bill whispered that she may have
inherited the Hanoverian madness off to

201
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:48,020
rule. There was so much inbreeding going
on and that part of a family that it

202
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:51,500
shouldn't be surprising those all of
them were known for being a bit nuts.

203
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,520
She dressed in black at all times
and acted completely melodramatic.

204
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,000
She write letters on paper with a
black border to signify that she was in

205
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:01,100
mourning instead of staying
in Buckingham Palace.

206
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:04,160
She went on long holidays
and Germany in a diary.

207
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,730
She right that she wished she could
have a normal life and she could live in

208
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:11,600
Germany with albus without having to be
queen at this points, everyone begins.

209
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,480
Cool, Huh? The widow of Windsor,
for the rest of our life,

210
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,910
Victoria wore black every single day.

211
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,790
She went on one of the longest
periods of mourning in history.

212
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,400
People thought that this
was tragically romantic,

213
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,350
so they become fascinated with death.

214
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,650
Suddenly it was fashionable to
enjoy spooky and creepy things,

215
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,340
and this inspired a great deal of
amazing culture during the Victorian era.

216
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,900
Now most people think that this is a
story ends and she remains a very sad and

217
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,640
serious woman for the rest of the days,

218
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,870
but the reality is is that she was able
to heal and she learned to love her life.

219
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,883
Once again

220
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,420
after returning to the United Kingdom
and Victoria and met a Scottish man named

221
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,960
John Brown when she was 45 old brown had
been Prince Albert's assistant whenever

222
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:58,780
he visited Scotland,
so he was there to pay his respects.

223
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,730
Instead of seeing her just as the queen,

224
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:04,810
he could see that Victoria was an
incredibly lonely woman and all she really

225
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,460
needed in our life.
It was a friends.

226
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,210
The two of them would get into long
conversations where she pulled out all of

227
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:13,950
the feelings that she had kept secrets
or just only recent in her diaries for a

228
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,530
very long time.
Brown had a lot of sympathy for her.

229
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:18,190
Runs became devoted to serving hat.

230
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,180
He swore that he would never leave
aside and take care of her every need.

231
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,010
The greatest gift John Brown gave a was
his personality. He was loud, he was rude.

232
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,040
It was almost always drunk.
He would drink whiskey,

233
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,520
something some into Victoria's
drink saying, don't stay thirsty.

234
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,080
No one had made Victoria at loft so much
and years and she absolutely loved it.

235
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,290
The ticket became best friends
and even possibly lovers.

236
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,610
If Brown disagreed with something he did,
he would yell, woman, what are you doing?

237
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,670
I'll look as shocked at
his level of disrespect,

238
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,410
but she actually enjoyed it very much.

239
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,400
No one had ever dent to talk to her like
that. So Teresa, like a normal person.

240
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,390
Her entire life, everyone had treated
her like she was weak and stupid,

241
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,380
but John Brown,

242
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,000
he knew how smart and strong she truly
was saying he held to a higher standard.

243
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,680
That friendship,
it lifted our spirits house.

244
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:09,130
I've had depression and she
was the happiest. She had
been in a very long time.

245
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,941
All their life.

246
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:14,110
Victoria was rising in our journals every
single day and she was an avid reader.

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,400
She made a decision to do something that
no other Monique has ever done before.

248
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,533
Become an author.

249
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,810
Queen Victoria published a book called
leaves from the Journal of our lives in

250
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:23,531
the highlands,

251
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,190
which was full of access from our own
personal journal about a friendship with

252
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:29,440
John Brown and how he changed my life.

253
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,200
It became a best seller and sold
over a hundred thousand copies.

254
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,020
She even gave a dedication to
drawn Brown's muscular legs,

255
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:38,110
which peaked out of his kilt that kids,
they were embarrassed,

256
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,140
but then again any kid would
feel embarrassed of them.

257
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,680
Other wrote about those things and
then publish them off to a death.

258
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,870
Victoria Victoria's daughter Beatrice
deleted all mention of John Brown when she

259
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,630
was rewriting Victoria's journals because
that relationship was considered to be

260
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,230
Yay Trudy humiliating
stain on the royal family,

261
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,750
but of course she couldn't
alter raise him from history.

262
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,030
Queen Victoria had commissioned statues
to be made and John Brown's on errands,

263
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,080
plenty of people who witnessed
them together when he was alive.

264
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,830
Victoria and John held hands together and
hugged one another in public and so of

265
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,260
course there was also the book she
published about that friendship.

266
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,430
There is also a remit.

267
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,500
They were secretly lovers Victoria and
they'd show the snaps in conjoining

268
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,810
bedrooms and dead children called
him mamma's love up on his deathbed.

269
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,920
The Queen's personal chaplain referenced
Norman Cloud confessed that he married

270
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:24,010
Queen Victoria and John Brown
in secret ceremony is they said,

271
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:27,070
and we would learn that he gave
her his mother's engagement ring.

272
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,110
Tragically though she outlived Brown too,

273
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:31,120
even though he was several
years younger than hot.

274
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,210
He died at age 56 so she lost yet another
man in her life that she truly loved.

275
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,230
In 1997 a movie called Mrs. Brown was
made to dramatize that love story.

276
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,150
Despite the evidence there
are still historians.

277
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:46,900
He refused to believe that Queen Victoria
would marry a common name like John

278
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,090
Brown and if she had the things,

279
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,800
you would have been brave enough to let
the world know instead of keeping it a

280
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,430
secret.
Unfortunately,

281
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,550
we never know all the details
because there've been lost forever.

282
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,670
As we mentioned before,

283
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:05,820
Queen Victoria was incapable of running
a government's on our own and she was

284
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,010
known for being a bit off her rocker.

285
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,700
The decisions she made were usually
based on her personal preferences rather

286
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,740
than politics.
Prime Minister Gladstone,

287
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,470
he was very serious and you didn't
have any sense of humor. It's whole.

288
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,510
So of course Victoria,
how you just him.

289
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,420
They would write nasty letters back and
forth to one another even though they

290
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,390
both would have done Buckingham Palace
and could have easily spoken to one

291
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,880
another face to face the
next prime minister Disraeli.

292
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:30,030
It has a much better sense of
humor and treated her with respect.

293
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,090
He would compliment how orange
treat her like the role she wants.

294
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,760
Disraeli lovingly called her the fairy
queen and gave her the title empress of

295
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,610
India. Queen Victoria had never
been to India in her entire life,

296
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:42,960
but it's often being given the title.

297
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,110
She sat down and learn as much about
the country as she possibly could.

298
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,830
She hired a tutor named Abdul Kareem so
that she could learn to speak the Indian

299
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:52,150
language Hindustani in how notebooks.

300
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,920
She took notes every time she asked
him how to save for the Taisha,

301
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,860
so dirty things.

302
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,240
Crim became a new favorite seven since
he was given the title of the Munchy or

303
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,420
the teacher. Victoria allows
him to go with her everywhere,

304
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,210
even when she was on holiday
compared to the loud John Brown.

305
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:09,160
The people in Queen Victoria is
course well, actually relieves the,

306
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,110
her new favorite servant was at least
a soft spoken and a real gentleman.

307
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,840
They saw this as a huge improvements.
However,

308
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,990
the Curran soon began to get showered
with gifts and gained a lot more

309
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:19,740
privileges.

310
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,800
Plenty of people were concerned
the Victoria was going
to be taken advantage off

311
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:25,920
and that she was making poor decisions,
often wielding a good two's.

312
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,120
I didn't exactly qualify Kareem to become
someone who held a position of power,

313
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,730
but the moments, anyone questions,
anything to do with career,

314
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,860
she would accuse them of being racist.

315
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Abdul Karim was always getting sick
and it turns out that he had gotten

316
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,730
gonorrhea,

317
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,390
but of course if the Raul physician got
frustrated at Victoria would pull the

318
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,380
race card.
Once again.

319
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,370
He came with a on vacation and the Riviera
runs the newspapers described in this

320
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,090
a seventh she writes me a letter to the
newspaper and demanded that they retract.

321
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,130
Then I'll story and submit a correction.

322
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,030
Abdul Karim was an educated
gentleman and to and secretary.

323
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,920
While she was incredibly eccentric.

324
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,220
There is no doubt this once anyone
became Queen Victoria's friends,

325
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,420
she was fiercely loyal and it's
made sure they lived that best life.

326
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,423
Hm.

327
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,470
At 81 years old,

328
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,130
Queen Victoria out plans for her death
and when she had a hemorrhagic stroke,

329
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,800
they knew how to per Patho have funeral.
Throughout that life,

330
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:22,080
Queen Victoria had been
given precious jewels,

331
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,720
but they meant nothing to
her in those final days.

332
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,440
She told her doctors that what she wanted
was a number of sentimental items with

333
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,350
her in a coffin.
First was Albert's dressing gown,

334
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,200
which she had in their bedroom
all of those years. Next, well,

335
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:37,590
the photos of the children as well as
the locks of their hair that she had

336
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,180
collected from their first hack outs.

337
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,890
She requested to have a framed
photograph of John Brown in our hands.

338
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,760
Lang over our heart on her finger.

339
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:48,610
She wore an engagement ring that belongs
to John Brown's mother, Queen Victoria.

340
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,250
His took place on February.

341
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:52,980
The second is 1901 despite it
being in the middle of winter,

342
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,940
thousands of people showed up to mourn
and it became one of the largest funerals

343
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,750
in history.

344
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,890
She never let the country three war or
haven't made any substantial improvements

345
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:04,830
in politics, but people,
they loved her all the same.

346
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,580
So many prime ministers came and
went during Victoria's reign.

347
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,740
There have been all but forgotten.

348
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,920
You could say that they were some
of the first true influences.

349
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,030
Everything they did caused a ripple
effect for the rest of society and Queen

350
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,080
Victoria was no exception.

351
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,950
In fact at life was so colorful this
and we think of the Victorian era.

352
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,690
We truly do gas, a very vivid image
of that time period in our minds,

353
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,530
the clothes,

354
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,800
the style and the attitude of the
people that would just like the queen,

355
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,270
serious on the outside and wild
on the inside. It's delicious.

356
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:39,450
Lee Romantic and yet very
dark at the same time.

357
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,060
That time period is still popular to this.

358
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,110
Dan Queen Victoria is going to be
remembered as one of the most impactful

359
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,670
figures in history. So I really hope you
