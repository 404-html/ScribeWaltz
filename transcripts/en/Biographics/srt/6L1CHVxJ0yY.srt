1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,640
2,500 years ago,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,050
one man's spiritual,

3
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:07,620
Jenny was the beginning of one
of the world's major religions.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,030
Today,

5
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,740
boasts 376 million followers.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,010
He is simply called the Buddha
and he grew up the son of a king,

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,650
sheltered from the realities
of human suffering.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,840
When he finally learned the harsh truth,

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,280
he left his family and set off on a
path to understand the life itself.

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,620
First as a monk and then as a teacher,

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,030
and this week biographics,

12
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:29,340
we take a look at the
Buddha Siddhartha Gautama,

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,340
the founder of Buddhism,

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,300
was a man named Siddhartha Galton,

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,490
that he was the son of a chief tannins
believe to be born in Lumbini Modern Dana

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,930
Paul in the sixth century BC.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,711
His father,

18
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:57,650
so at her Donna translating
to he who grows pure rice,

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,970
presided over a large clan and cools the
shack yard in either a republic or an

20
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:03,200
oligarchy system of rule.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,690
His mother was Queen Meyer of Sakyo,

22
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,910
who is said to have died
shortly after his bath.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,050
The infant was given the name Sid Arthur,

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,270
meaning he who achieves his aim
when [inaudible] was still a baby.

25
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:18,500
Several Sears with the power
of supernatural insight
into the future predicted

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,110
he would either be a
great spiritual leader,

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,160
military leader,

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,173
or a king.

29
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,920
Since it off his mother died.

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,400
He was brought up by his maternal aunts,

31
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,850
Maha [inaudible] potty,

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,720
his father hoping to steer Sid Arthur
and the direction of the throne shielded

33
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:37,250
him from many religion of any kinds and
sheltered him from seeing human hardship

34
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:38,084
and suffering.

35
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,750
As such,

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,720
he was raised in the lap of
luxury and blissful ignorance,

37
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,170
sweat.

38
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,080
He knew nothing about
aging disease or death.

39
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,800
Had the age of 16 is it office father
arranged his marriage to his cousin.

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:48,970
Yeah,

41
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,640
I said Ira,

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,960
who was also a teenager.

43
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,750
She gave birth to rep who
though some years later said,

44
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,830
Arthur said,

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,330
do you have remained living in the palace
until the age of 29 and that was when

46
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,520
everything changed according to the story.

47
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,390
One day off that traveled outside of
the palace gates and he was deeply

48
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,340
disturbed by the site of an old man.

49
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,360
His Cherry is here,

50
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,880
China or explaining just the Dothan.

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,290
There's all people grow old and die.

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,450
The death is an integral part of life.

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,480
This prompted Arthur secretly venture
outside the palace on more and more trips.

54
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,300
When leaving,

55
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,810
it was said that the horses
hooves well muffled by the gods,

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,040
so it was to prevent the
guards from knowing if his
departure outside the gates.

57
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,520
On these trips he encountered a sick
man and they decay and Kolbes and a

58
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,840
homeless only man,

59
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,460
also known as an ascetic.

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,960
China told Sid Arthur that ascetics give
up that material possessions and forego

61
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:39,890
physical pleasures.

62
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,050
Very higher spiritual purpose.

63
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,710
After witnessing the reality of
human hardship and suffering,

64
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,560
said author had no interest
in living at the palace.

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,270
He left his wife and child to discover
the true meaning of life first by living

66
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,390
as a traveling bag or like the
aesthetics that he saw on the streets.

67
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,601
Is it off of us?

68
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,570
Went to the city of Reggie,

69
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,221
got Har n's,

70
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:13,350
began begging on the
streets in order to survive.

71
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,980
He was recognized dad by the king's
men and he was offered the throne.

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,280
He rejected his promise to come back
and visit it once he had attained

73
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,114
enlightenment.

74
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,110
Once he left the city,

75
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,010
he met her hermits.

76
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,050
Brahmins saints named Alara.

77
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:25,884
Kalama.

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,630
Kalama taught Sid Arthur a form of
meditation known as the sphere of

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,613
nothingness,

80
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,510
said Arthur eventually
became his teachers.

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,510
Equal Kalama offered him his place saying,

82
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,820
you are the same as I am now.

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,290
There is no difference between us.

84
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,740
Stay here and take my place
and teach my students with me,

85
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,730
but it's an author.

86
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,960
He didn't stand in steady,

87
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,990
moved on to another teacher
who darker Rammer pooter.

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,621
Once again,

89
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:53,700
he achieved high levels of meditative
consciousness and was asked to succeed.

90
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:54,520
Has Teacher.

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,200
It's an author,

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,470
refused the offer once again and he moved
on through the practice of meditation.

93
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,810
It's an Alpha realized eight state
of perfect equanimity and awareness.

94
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,520
Auntie was on the path to enlightenment.

95
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,230
He also realized that living life as an
extremely deprived beggars he had done.

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,233
It wasn't working.

97
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,300
It had been six years and he had eaten
very little and fostered until he was

98
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:16,134
incredibly weak

99
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,630
off the starving himself for days.

100
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:28,030
Sit Off.

101
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,250
That famously accepted Milken rice
pudding from a village girl named Sujata.

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,830
He was so amazed.

103
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,580
She thought he was a spirit,

104
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,170
that to grant her a wish.

105
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,950
So the author,

106
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,640
after having this meal decided against
living the life of extreme self denial.

107
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,170
Since his spiritual goals,

108
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,400
when not being mad,

109
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,430
he instead of opposite to follow a path
of balance known in Buddhism as the

110
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,530
Middle Way.

111
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,250
At this turning point is five followers
believed he was giving up and they

112
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,084
abandoned him.

113
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,780
Soon after he began meditating under a
fig tree and committed himself to staying

114
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,730
there until he had found enlightenment.

115
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,900
He meditated for six days and nights and
reached enlightenment on the full moon.

116
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:04,860
Morning of May,

117
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,430
a week before he turned 35 at
the time of his enlightenment,

118
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,050
he gained complete insight into the cause
of suffering and the steps necessary

119
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:13,980
to eliminators.

120
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,210
He called these steps,

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,330
the four noble truths after his awakening,

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,710
the Buddha,

123
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,250
Matt to too much and brothers from
the city of balco run modern day.

124
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:24,690
I've got a the brothers
trapezes runs Baja.

125
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:29,040
Leeka offered the Buddha his first meal
after enlightenments and they became his

126
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,270
first later cycles.

127
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,510
According to some tax.

128
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,830
It's each of these brothers gave her hair
and they were in shrine at a temple in

129
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:35,430
Rangoon,

130
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,263
Burma.

131
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,060
Legend has it this initially,

132
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,190
but I was reluctant to
spread his knowledge.

133
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,024
Do rather is this.

134
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,340
He was doubtful of whether the common
people would understand his teachings,

135
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,020
but then the king of Gods,

136
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:07,340
Brahma convinced Buddha to teach
and that was what he set out to do.

137
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
The Buddha travel to deer park in
northern India where he set in motion what

138
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,320
Buddhists call the wheel of Dharma by
delivering his first sermon to the five

139
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,230
companions who had abandoned
him earlier together with him,

140
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,840
they formed the first five Buddhist monks.

141
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,710
All five attains nirvana or estate
along the path to enlightenment.

142
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,250
Yes,

143
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,900
not full enlightenment.

144
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,920
They were known as the ones who are
worthy or perfected people from the first

145
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:31,730
group of five.

146
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,190
It's steadily grew to 60
within the first few months,

147
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,660
and eventually the song,

148
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,880
how I reached more than 1000 people,

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,030
the sign code traveled through the
sub continent expounding the Dharma.

150
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,500
This continued throughout the year except
during the four months of the Vassar

151
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,950
rainy season when ascetics of
all religions rarely traveled.

152
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,220
One reason was that it was more difficult
to do say without causing harm to

153
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,054
animal life.

154
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,900
At this time of year,

155
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,910
the Sangha would retreat to monasteries,

156
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,760
public parks or forests where
people would come to them.

157
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,120
The first was sauna was spent at
Veranasi when the Sangha was formed.

158
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,691
After this,

159
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,420
the Buddha kept a promise
to travel to Roger,

160
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:07,760
got the capital of Megalodon
to visit king than Besara.

161
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,601
During this visit,

162
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,040
Sarah put her in Maui Gallia.

163
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,130
Yana were converted to a psyche.

164
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,940
One of the first five disciples.

165
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,691
After this,

166
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,240
they were to become the
Buddhist to foremost followers.

167
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,130
The Buddha spent the next
three seasons at Vella,

168
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:21,890
Vanna Bamboo Grove monastery,

169
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:22,780
and Roger [inaudible],

170
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,500
the capital of Magna Carta.

171
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,210
Upon hearing of his sons awakening,

172
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:26,930
so to Hannah,

173
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,230
sent over a period 10
delegations to ask him to return.

174
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,730
On the first nine occasions,

175
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,490
the delegates fail to deliver the
message and instead joins the sang herds

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,201
become era.

177
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:37,150
Hence the tents.

178
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,870
Delegation led by color dye.

179
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:42,050
He a childhood friend of [inaudible]
who also became an [inaudible] offense,

180
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,620
however,

181
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,290
delivered the message now two
years after his awakening,

182
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,860
the Buddha agreed to return and it's
made a two month journey by first to

183
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,900
capital of Vastu teaching of the Dahmer.

184
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,680
As he went,

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,090
I just returned the royal palace,

186
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:54,320
prepared a midday meal,

187
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,620
but the Sanger was making an alms
rounds in capital Avastin hearing this,

188
00:07:58,621 --> 00:07:58,841
that whoa.

189
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,200
Donna approached his son,

190
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,063
but her saying,

191
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,050
how's the warrior lineage of Muhammad
Sata and not a single warrior has gone

192
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,900
seeking arms.

193
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,410
The Buddha is said to have replied
that it's not the custom of your royal

194
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,040
lineage,

195
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,410
but it is the custom of my Buddha lineage.

196
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,770
Several thousands of Buddhas
have gone by seeking arms.

197
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,060
Buddhist texts say that suited
honor invited the Sangha.

198
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:20,480
I rented the palace for the meal,

199
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,950
followed by a Dharma talk.

200
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,780
After this,

201
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,880
he has said to have become a sought
out partner during the visit.

202
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,160
Many members of the royal
family join the Sangha,

203
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,720
the Buddhist cousins and Nada and a
new radar became too if it's five chief

204
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,220
disciples at the age of seven his son
Rahula also joins and became one of his 10

205
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,180
chief disciples.

206
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,050
His half brother,

207
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,360
Nanda also joined and
became an error hands.

208
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,270
His wife reportedly became
a nun throughout his life,

209
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,320
but it encourages students to question
his teachings and confirmed them through

210
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,460
their own experience.

211
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,570
This non dogmatic attitude still
characterizes Buddhism today.

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,620
Buddhism is the fourth largest religion
in the world and it is also one of the

213
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:14,220
oldest established in the sixth
century BC in Present Day Nepal,

214
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:14,670
India.

215
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,780
Unlike other religions,

216
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,400
Buddhists do not worship a god.

217
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,941
Instead,

218
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:22,170
they focus on spiritual developments with
the end goal of becoming enlightened,

219
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
though not in the intellectual sense
of the word in the Western world's

220
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:29,520
enlightenment is most often associated
with the 18th century European

221
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:30,570
enlightenment period.

222
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,190
Movements characterized by a rational
and scientific approach to politics,

223
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:35,850
religion,

224
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,650
and social and economic issues.

225
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,371
In Buddhism,

226
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,690
the simplest explanation of attaining
enlightenment is when an individual finds

227
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,660
out the truth about life and
experiences and awakening.

228
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,210
Where they are freed from
the cycle of being reborn.

229
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,650
Central to Buddhism is the notion that
to live is to suffer and everything is in

230
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,120
a constant state of change.

231
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,330
All Buddhists believe unless
one has become enlightened,

232
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,480
they will be reincarnated again and to
gain four principles that the Buddha came

233
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,850
to understand during his
meditation under the Bodhi Tree,

234
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,290
these are the truth of suffering.

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,860
Ducati,

236
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,850
the truth of origin,

237
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:09,510
of suffering.

238
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm a Daya the truth of
cessation of suffering and
they're a ta and the truth of

239
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:15,930
the path of cessation of suffering.

240
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,780
Maga suffering comes in many forms.

241
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:22,340
Three obvious kinds are suffering
corresponding to the first three sides,

242
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,100
the Buddhist soreness,

243
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,810
first journey outside his palace,

244
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,793
old age,

245
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,180
sickness and death.

246
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,780
The Buddha,

247
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,070
the problem of suffering goes much deeper
though life is not ideal if frequently

248
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:34,260
fails to live up to our expectations,

249
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,101
human beings,

250
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,290
all subjects to desires and cravings,

251
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
but even when we are able
to satisfy these desires,

252
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,990
dissatisfaction is only temporary.

253
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,340
Pleasure does not last,

254
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,180
and if it does,

255
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,440
it becomes monotonous.

256
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,310
Even when we are not suffering
from outward causes like
illness or Bereavements,

257
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,070
we are unfulfilled or unsatisfied.

258
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,230
This is simply the truth of suffering.

259
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,630
The next [inaudible] truth
is the origin of suffering,

260
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,830
not day to day troubles may seem
to have easily identifiable causes.

261
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,250
First painted them and injuries.

262
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:06,600
Sadness from the loss of a loved one in
the second of his noble truths though,

263
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,800
but a claimed to have found the cause
of all suffering and it is much more

264
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,110
deeply rooted than our immediate worries.

265
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,660
The Buddha taught that the root
of all suffering is desire.

266
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,530
Tanya,

267
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,790
this comes in three forms
which he describes as the
three roots of evil or the

268
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,130
three fires or the three poisons.

269
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,320
The three roots of evil
are greed and desire.

270
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:30,090
Representatives in ours by a Rasta
ignorance or delusion represented by a pig

271
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,660
and hatred and destructive
urges represented by a snake.

272
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,540
The third noble truth is
the cessation of suffering,

273
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,410
and I wrote her,

274
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,200
the Buddha taught that the
way to extinguish desire,

275
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:43,470
which causes suffering is to
liberate oneself from attachments.

276
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,690
This is the third noble truth,

277
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,580
the possibility of liberation.

278
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,020
The Buddha was a living example of that.

279
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,820
This is possible in the human lifetime.

280
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,090
Estrangement here means disenchantment
or Buddhist things to no sense conditions

281
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,390
clearly as they are without becoming
in Sean's head or misled by them.

282
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,340
Nirvana means extinguishing.

283
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
Attaining Nirvana.

284
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,530
Reaching enlightenment means
extinguishing the three fires of greed,

285
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,060
delusion and hatred.

286
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,150
Someone who reaches Nirvana does not
immediately disappear to a heavenly realm.

287
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,630
Nirvana is better understood as the
state of minds that humans can reach.

288
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,650
It is a state of profound spiritual joy
with our negative emotions and fears.

289
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,040
Someone who has attained enlightenment
is filled with compassion for all living

290
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,520
things after death and enlightened
person is liberated from the cycle of

291
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,240
rebirth,

292
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,410
but Buddhism gives him no definitely
balances as to what happens next.

293
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,220
The Buddha discouraged his followers
from asking too many questions about

294
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:36,790
Nirvana.

295
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,430
He wanted them to concentrate
on the task at hand,

296
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,040
which was freeing themselves
from the cycle of suffering,

297
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,330
asking questions.

298
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,860
It's like quibbling with the doctor.

299
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,720
He was trying to save your life.

300
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,310
The fourth noble truth is the path
to the cessation of suffering Maga.

301
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,040
This final noble truth is
the Buddhist prescription.

302
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,120
For the end of suffering.

303
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,360
This is a set of principles
calls the eight fold path.

304
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,970
The eightfold path is also
called the middle way.

305
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,300
It avoids both indulgence
and Sverre asceticism,

306
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,750
either of which the Buddha found
helpful in his search for enlightenment.

307
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,330
The age stages are not
to be taken in order,

308
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,210
but rather support and
reinforce each other.

309
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,460
At the age of 18 bitter announced
that he would soon reach Perry,

310
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:37,040
nirvana,

311
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,500
Raleigh,

312
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,990
final deathless state,

313
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,590
and abandon his earthly body.

314
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,311
After this,

315
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,810
the Buddha ate his last meal,

316
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,840
which he had received as an offering
from a blacksmith named couldn't dot

317
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,411
holding,

318
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:50,790
violently ill bitter instructed his
attendance and Nada to convince Kunda the

319
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,990
meal eaten at his place had nothing to
do with his passing and that his meal
