1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,130
He is the world's most famous cyclist
dominating his sport like no one before or

2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:06,820
since yet.

3
00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:11,650
His reputation has four ever been
tarnished by a scandal that tor the very

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,990
fabric of professional cycling,

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,900
pitting the sports elite
against one another.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,860
The doping scandal,

7
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:18,400
however,

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,400
was just one in a series of mounds in
like obstacles that have confronted Lance

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,880
Armstrong.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,850
This story of how he has overcome
them is one of perseverance,

11
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,684
tenacity,

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
and self belief.

13
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,120
And in this week's bland graphics,

14
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:34,780
we explore the tumultuous
life of Lance Armstrong

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,290
loans.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,290
Edward Armstrong was born
as Lance Gunderson in Texas
on September the 18th 1971

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:57,761
his mother,

18
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,091
Linda,

19
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,460
was just 17 years old in
a high school dropout.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,110
While his biological father at he
Gunderson was a route or manager for the

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,550
Dallas Morning News,

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,960
the marriage was an unhappy one with
Eddie at proving to be abusive and

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,980
neglectful.

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,770
They divorced when lance
was only two years old.

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,910
Before long lens up,

26
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:17,040
she had remarried and Lance,

27
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,590
his step father was a traveling
salesman named Terry Armstrong.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,390
Armstrong was a stern,

29
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:26,470
distant man who never really bonded
with lungs during his formative years.

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,730
Terry's job kept him Oh,

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,870
away from home a lot,

32
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:29,820
and when he was home,

33
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:34,570
he proved to be a harsh disciplinary and
who would beat lance with a paddle for

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,040
any sort of incursion?

35
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,970
Not surprisingly,

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,230
the y looked forward to his stepfather's
work trips when it was just him and his

37
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,064
mother at home.

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,570
As the years progressed,

39
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,810
the family's finances improved since
they moved to better neighborhoods.

40
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,920
They ended up in Richardson where Linda
signed up young lance for swimming

41
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:51,550
lessons.

42
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,620
She also bought him a bicycle.

43
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,510
Young Lance was an active,

44
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:56,081
inquisitive.

45
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:59,800
Charles the often got into fights with
one scuff were getting kicked off the

46
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,100
school bus after which he
rode his bicycle to school.

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:03,490
Yeah,

48
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,260
I love of competitive sports though.

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,690
He never really clicked with football,

50
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:10,380
which was the dominant sport in Texas.

51
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,020
Instead,

52
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,990
he became passionate about
her running and swimming.

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,120
Lance has an abundance of energy.

54
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,520
His favorite TV show
was the $6 million man,

55
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:21,640
and he loved nothing better than to run
around the neighborhoods pretending to

56
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,950
be UV bionic man as he chunk did.

57
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:26,560
The words of the show's theme song better,

58
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,603
stronger,

59
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,470
faster from Richardson.

60
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,090
The Armstrongs move to Plano,

61
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:31,560
Texas,

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,420
where Linda Linda's new job as
a telecommunications company.

63
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,240
Secretary enabled them
to buy their first house.

64
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,420
It was here that they lived through
the bulk of Lance's schooling.

65
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,490
He attended the Armstrong middle school,

66
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:44,860
Williams hi and Plano East.

67
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,370
Hi.

68
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,330
Linda bought her son his first serious
bike when he was seven years old.

69
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,570
There was a Schwinn Mag
scrambler BMX racing bike,

70
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,650
the bike along with a helmet and safety
gear costs three times what Linda was

71
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,461
sleeping dispense,

72
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:01,750
but she saw the value in her son
involved in an outdoor sport.

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,340
Longs wrote his scrambler Antony was 13
when his mother bought him mercy I road

74
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,270
bike with his competitive career began
just 12 years old when he can beat it in

75
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,100
the Plano swim club champs.

76
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,480
He saw some success,

77
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:18,460
but a year later he saw a poster for a
triathlon and decided to switch to the

78
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,440
three discipline event is first.

79
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,390
Triathlon was the [inaudible] kids,

80
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,220
which he won pretty handily with.

81
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,120
His stepfather are often
absent from the home loans.

82
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,500
Lacks a strong male role model.

83
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,150
During his formative years.

84
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,680
That role was filled in his early teens
by Chris McCardy has Plano swimming,

85
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,150
coach McCarthy trained Armstrong right
through middle school and high school and

86
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,980
encouraged him to compete on a national
level and even to set his sights on the

87
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,240
Olympics and other man who
took an interest in the
teenage lance was the owner

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,630
of a local bicycle shop and
his name was Jim Height.

89
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,620
He gave the Armstrongs discounts on
equipment since lawns managed to answer

90
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,290
money writing for the events
that were sponsored by height.

91
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,380
When Lance was 14 he
competed and won his first.

92
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:07,270
Did you ask Lon consisting of swimming
and running the prize was a $100 pair of

93
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,590
avo running shoes.

94
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,071
However,

95
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,900
when the shoe's arrived in the mail,

96
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,890
they did not fit.

97
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,220
The sales rep who came to the Armstrong
home with a replacement paths,

98
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,063
got Eder,

99
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,990
ended up taking lance under his
wing and taking him do work outs and

100
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,740
competitions that took lance do
the Cooper Institute in Dallas.

101
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,550
When the boy was 16 the researchers
that tested his vo two Max,

102
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:32,551
which came out at 79.5% it was the
highest that they had ever seen.

103
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,940
This men's of alarms had an incredible
ability to make use of every breath of

104
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,410
oxygen that came into his body.

105
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,670
The testing also showed that he had the
highest lactic acid threshold that they

106
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,030
had ever come across
through his formative years.

107
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,730
Lance had a knack for getting
himself into quite a bit of trouble.

108
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,060
The and his mates would sneak into the
neighbor's house and steal beer from the

109
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:52,600
fridge.

110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,261
On one occasion,

111
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:56,650
he and another boy glued the mailbox
as a man who they had argued with.

112
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,290
The police eventually came
calling when he stolen.

113
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Armstrong street sign isn't ornaments
for his room when he was 16 however,

114
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,870
his mother told him that she was
planning on leaving his stepfather.

115
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,420
She,

116
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,101
Aj salons.

117
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,100
Do you stop getting into trouble that
she wouldn't be able to handle the stress

118
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,240
that it would bring to hop?

119
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Moms responded to channeling all of
his energy into a sporting events.

120
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,810
Molson Linda now spent most weekends
together traveling to 10 k running events

121
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:34,060
and triathlons that he
competed in during the week.

122
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,750
Mom spent many hours going on long
rides with his cycling buddies.

123
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,770
Lindsey helped her son.

124
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,700
Do you see callus sponsors who would
supply such things as she is and Jesse's

125
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,830
every single sponsor received a
handwritten letter of thanks from Lance.

126
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,080
So there are four competitive
cycling categories.

127
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,050
All writers start out a cat for freelance.

128
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:56,800
This meant Tuesday nights criteria
and rides at the local bike march.

129
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,500
It wasn't long before he moved up to cat
three where he found himself training

130
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,340
with a couple of cat one guys when he
was 16 lance who's writing is messy,

131
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,820
a racing bike along the Dallas country
side when he was apparently run off the

132
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,020
road by a truck driver,

133
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,780
a furious lance curse at
the driver from the asphalt.

134
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,670
This caused the man to see red and the
stocks his truck and got out in a rage

135
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,100
launch,

136
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,530
jumped to his feet and took off.

137
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,080
But the man trashed his
bike before we left.

138
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,510
Lawrence managed to record
it's number place and uh,

139
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,490
proceeded to sue this man and when she
used the money to buy his son and you

140
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,560
Randy bike with racing wheels,

141
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,470
noncitizen you bike.

142
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,690
They didn't last long.

143
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
Not long after receiving his,

144
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,710
he was hit by an SUV while
running a yellow light.

145
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,280
He was thrown over the handlebars
and onto the hood of the SUV.

146
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,080
He was lucky to get away alive,

147
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,330
especially since he
wasn't wearing a helmet,

148
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,460
who turns up at the hospital
with a twisted foot,

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,540
some scrapes,

150
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,560
and a concussion with his foot laced
with stitches and the heavy brace lawns.

151
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,770
His doctor told him to do
nothing for the next three weeks,

152
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,290
but there was just one problem.

153
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,520
He had a triathlon race in six days.

154
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,460
The doctor simply told
him to forget about it.

155
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,210
Instead,

156
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,210
he got rid of the brace on the second day,

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,570
cut out the stitches himself with a
nail clipper and turns up Hamas starting

158
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:08,960
line.

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,250
That Saturday he led the swim and the
ride eventually coming in third when he

160
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,030
heard about it,

161
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,350
the doctor who had treated him,

162
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,890
he could hardly believe that by the
time of his final year in high school in

163
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,430
1989 launched was a national
level citing can pastor.

164
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,120
He had qualifying to train with the
junior national team at Colorado and

165
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:29,120
preparation for the world
junior championships.

166
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,640
Throughout his high school years,

167
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,910
Lance had missed a lot of school due to
is traveling around the countryside to

168
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,600
compete.

169
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,770
The school or however had viewed the
absences as being on par with playing

170
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,400
hooky.

171
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,510
They told him that he did not have leave
to go to Colorado or indeed to follow

172
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,300
on to Moscow to compete in
the world championships.

173
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
The facts of that cycling wasn't even
recognized as a sports by Texas high

174
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,520
schools at the time.

175
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,080
Certainly factored into their decision
making more was to come though despite is

176
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,710
working overtime to meet the requirements
or meeting was called where lance and

177
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:05,000
his mother were sold that he would not
be able to graduate with his class that

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,210
year.

179
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,020
They didn't care that he was an emerging
elite athletes with an unprecedented

180
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,940
opportunity to advance his career.

181
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,420
So then once he was simply a slacker,

182
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,620
Linda soon got her son into a private
school that would let him graduate the

183
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,810
teachers of the new school
bending Oaks Academy.

184
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,980
We're happy to work around
lancers schedule to help
him complete his schooling.

185
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,700
Armstrong's fierce competitiveness
brought into the attention of the coach of

186
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,380
the u s national cycling team,

187
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,400
Chris Carmichael,

188
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,060
Carmichael,

189
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,870
they didn't knows it.

190
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,380
He was so aggressive that either had tear
the field apart and the when or apple,

191
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,340
everyone after him.

192
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,620
So they blew by him at the ends.

193
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,390
Lawns qualified for and competed in the
junior world champs in Moscow in 1989

194
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,640
this was to prove to be his breakout,

195
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:50,990
yet he got more attention than others
because of his aggressive racing style and

196
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,710
he broke away from the main group in the
first lab arising in the front Peloton

197
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,570
and was right up there
until the final thrust.

198
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:57,960
Wow.

199
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,580
Stronger writers pushed ahead of him,

200
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,290
his performance and Moscow in Mark's
Armstrong as the most exciting new cyclist

201
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,580
on the world stage,

202
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,270
he showed himself to be an aggressive
competitor with the ability to focus like

203
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:11,670
a laser beam on achieving his goals.

204
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,350
He was supremely confidence,

205
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,600
which was easy to redesign arrogance.

206
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:18,810
He also had no interest in
writing as a part of a team.

207
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,190
He did the ones anything due to attract
him from his desire to cross the finish

208
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:23,610
line.

209
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,443
First,

210
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,450
it was in 1992 that Armstrong competed
at his first Olympics in Barcelona.

211
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,271
He loves you,

212
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:34,790
recall the t road and miserably as an
inexperienced hothead and to finish a

213
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,840
disappointing 14 from the road race.

214
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,531
There's performance.

215
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,040
However,

216
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,060
it wasn't enough to bring
him to the attention of the
director of a professional

217
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:42,870
sports team,

218
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,440
but we're sponsored by motor roller after
the games lawns with signed on to the

219
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:46,681
team,

220
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,380
which officially made him
a professional athlete.

221
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,330
I'm just the major road,

222
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:50,951
the banner long.

223
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:54,750
It's traveled to Europe in order to
compete in a series of road races as fast

224
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:59,040
race was and sounds sebasty in
Spain and t came in dead last.

225
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,100
The crowd jeered at him when he crossed
the line 30 minutes after the Winter

226
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,350
Armstrong with deflated after this race
and he considered flying back to the

227
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:08,190
United States.

228
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,630
But it's coach convinced him to stay
and prove himself and prove to his

229
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,330
teammates that he was no quitter and say,

230
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,571
well,

231
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,430
lawn stayed on from race to race.

232
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,720
He got better and he came in second the
Zurich championships finally telling

233
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,510
himself that he was capable of doing this.

234
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,121
One of Lance,

235
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:30,121
his biggest challenges with Motorola was
learning to work as part of a cycling

236
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,080
team.

237
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,710
He would quickly get frustrated with the
other riders in his Palatan yelling at

238
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:39,360
them to pull or get out of the way if
as it is with trying to frustrate him on

239
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:39,850
purpose,

240
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,850
encouraging him to take the lead and wear
himself out early after only 12 months

241
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,950
as a professional cyclist,

242
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,070
Landis had already earned the nickname
the king at the 1993 UCI track cycling

243
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:54,150
world championship and also the Norway,

244
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:57,840
the motor roller team decided that he
was ready to take the title and as they

245
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:01,530
would work with him to win the race
rather than rushing to the lead,

246
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,430
he stayed in the Peloton until the
second to last lap because he had been

247
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,360
instructed dude.

248
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,180
Then he attacked to take the lead and
stay that he crossed the line well ahead

249
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,360
of the competition and the bounds of the
crowd blew kisses and seeing what was

250
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,590
to become his trademark.

251
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,050
He pointed to the Sky Armstrong.

252
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,740
He was now the world champion,

253
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,060
this to truly be the vest.

254
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,980
He knew that he had to win the Tour de
France in 1995 he won a stage of the

255
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,120
world's greatest grace,

256
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,810
dedicating the win to a teammate
who had died during a crash.

257
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,430
In that very race in August of 1996
he signed a two year contract with the

258
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,690
coffee as cycling team

259
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,003
France

260
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,270
in 1996 salons notice that his
right testicle was becoming swollen.

261
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,390
This was followed by a dull
ache and then a lack of energy.

262
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,590
This is the thing that it is performance.

263
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:00,730
At the 96 Olympics,

264
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:03,480
Cindy had a disappointing
finish and his memoirs.

265
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,810
He recalled that he felt like he was
dragging a manhole cover during the road

266
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,190
race in October.

267
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,660
After returning from the Olympics,

268
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,630
Armstrong was diagnosed
with testicular cancer.

269
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,140
Yeah,

270
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,250
put off seeing a doctor,

271
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,080
but when he began coughing up a blood,

272
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,600
he knew that he had to act the news.

273
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,060
It rocked Armstrong as
well as the support team.

274
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,240
He was 25 an elite athlete and had stage
three testicular cancer that had spread

275
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,294
to his brain,

276
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,313
his lungs,

277
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,243
and his abdomen.

278
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,870
His chances of survival were estimated
to be below 50% and it looked pretty

279
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,700
likely that he would never race again.

280
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,270
Despite recently signing a two point
$5 million contract with [inaudible],

281
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,800
his team's liars decided that they would
not provide insurance coverage during

282
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,850
his treatments as the condition had not
been advised at the time of the signing

283
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,690
of the contract.

284
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,740
They want to sponsors,

285
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,101
however,

286
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,680
who did not abandon Armstrong
during his time of need.

287
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,560
Oakley even offered for him to be
covered under that health plan.

288
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,310
Armstrong took on the cancer challenge
with these same fierce determination that

289
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,690
had made him a well champion.

290
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,930
He underwent a program of
intense chemotherapy treatments.

291
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,980
He sought our sentence,

292
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,880
began treatment with a very caustic
chemo cocktail known as v I.

293
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,630
P which was less damaging on the
lungs than conventional treatments.

294
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,553
This choice,

295
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,520
it probably saved his cycling career
throughout his chemo treatments.

296
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,350
Armstrong competed sporadically.

297
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,303
Understandably,

298
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,420
he did not do well,

299
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,980
but he was keeping himself in the game.

300
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,200
The final chemo treatments it took
place on December the 13th 1996 and in

301
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:34,201
February of 1997 his doctors were able
to confirm that his cancer was in full

302
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,343
remission

303
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,980
on the stronger sounds
like competitive cycling.

304
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,770
At the beginning of 1998
his contracts with coffee,

305
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:54,390
this had been canceled in 1997 and he
had signed on with the US Postal Service

306
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:55,224
something team.

307
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,410
He moved to Europe with the team
to train for the tour to France.

308
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,240
Armstrong was now recognized as the
poster child for being a cancer survivor.

309
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,270
He received many awards and many titles
around 1998 he built successes one upon

310
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,590
another and the steadily improved.

311
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,690
Displacing that.

312
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:11,911
Yeah.

313
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,650
He also married his fiance,

314
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:14,550
Kristin Richard.

315
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,630
The marriage would last five years
and it would produce three children.

316
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,561
I'm the strong one.

317
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:24,561
His First Tour de France in 1999 he won
four stages and had learned to work well

318
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:25,740
with his teammates.

319
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,551
He finished the race.

320
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:31,110
It's seven minutes and 37 seconds ahead
of the second place finisher in a post

321
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:31,590
when interview.

322
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:36,590
He proclaims if you get a second chance
at life for something go all the way in

323
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,650
2000 and Armstrong came back to
France to 10 mins to defend his title.

324
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,090
The race turned down to be a battle
between him and [inaudible] Oreck who has

325
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,050
competed the previous.

326
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah.

327
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,560
This rivalry was to
continue for the next five.

328
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,230
Yes.

329
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,590
Armstrong cross the finish line.

330
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,250
Six minutes ahead of all Rick
to become a two time champion.

331
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,930
Armstrong dominated the cycling world in
the early 2000 years consecutive run of

332
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:04,580
Tour de France victories stretched on
to an unprecedented seven in a row from

333
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,670
1999 to 2005 following his July 24th,

334
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,650
2005 when he announced his
retirement from Connecticut

335
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,583
cycling

336
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,810
in the way you his stunning
1999 Tour de France victory.

337
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:30,590
There were allegations that Armstrong
must've been involved in either drug

338
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,210
taking or blood doping.

339
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,810
In early 2000 under the auspices
of the Nike Corporation,

340
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:40,640
He created a documentary
style advertisement entitled
body in order to answer

341
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,690
the detractors.

342
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,870
The film focused on his steely will to
win and showed footage of him undergoing

343
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,730
drug tests.

344
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,870
The voiceover narration,

345
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,730
it was done by Armstrong himself.

346
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,140
At one point he says,

347
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,420
everybody wants to know what I'm on.

348
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,583
What am I on?

349
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,980
I'm on my bike busting
my ass six hours a day.

350
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,293
What you wanted.

351
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,590
When results came through that he had
tested positive for a minute amount of

352
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,460
corticosteroid.

353
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,020
After the 99 Tour de France,

354
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,600
many people doubled down
on their accusations,

355
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,090
but the amounts in his body was seen.

356
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,170
My knew that they were not
enough to fail the test.

357
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,670
Since that one little blip,

358
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,750
he has never failed a drug test
that has however been quite a lot of

359
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:22,250
circumstantial evidence and 2004 a book
was published called La Confidential,

360
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:25,700
which claims at the time strong had
been using performance enhancing drugs.

361
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,180
They've quoted from Steve Swartz,

362
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,750
former motor roller team mate.

363
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:33,560
He claims that all the team members
were using as far back as 1995 when

364
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:37,820
allegations made in the
book were reprinted in the
British newspaper The Sunday

365
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:37,910
Times.

366
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,820
Armstrong sued them leading to
an out of court settlements.

367
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,120
In June of 2012 the U s antidoping agency
brought allegations against Armstrong

368
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,090
of running a huge doping ring among
his teammates cheering his competitive

369
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:50,750
career.

370
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,590
They weren't armed with testimony
from a number of former teammates.

371
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,590
Their goal was to have him banned from
any sport that followed the world,

372
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,690
Anti Doping Code Lance.

373
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,040
He did not appeal the band.

374
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,990
Armstrong continued to vehemently denied
the allegations of doping until 2013

375
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,810
then in a bombshell
interview with Oprah Winfrey.

376
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,400
He admitted that he had used performance
enhancing drugs for all of his tour de

377
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:14,330
France wins.

378
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,840
He claimed to have used a referee,

379
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,880
poet in and human growth hormone
and to have engaged in blood doping.

380
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,803
The reaction,

381
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,440
it was one of outrage parties
began lining up to sue Armstrong,

382
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:28,460
including teammates that he had called
Liars and parties that he had one libel

383
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:29,294
suits against.

384
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,380
The US Justice Department sued them for
millions of dollars that the US Postal

385
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,270
Service it's spent on
sponsorship to weld cycling,

386
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:35,931
Governing Body,

387
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,970
a few day lifetime ban to Armstrong.

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
He's still competes and amateur events.

389
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,370
However,

390
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,440
today he owns a coffee shop in Austin,

391
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:45,380
Texas and they bike shop
called mellow Johnny's.

392
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,920
Though he won't never shake the
reputation as the world's greatest cycling

393
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:50,430
cheat.

394
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,450
He has built a life for himself that
allows him to indulge his cycling passion

395
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,660
and his competitive nature
as an amateur athlete.

396
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,700
Following his successful
cancer treatments,

397
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,670
Armstrong started the
Lance Armstrong Foundation.

398
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,500
It began with a fundraising race.

399
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:16,330
Do you raise money for cancer research?

400
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,590
One of the most successful initiatives
over the foundation was the production in

401
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:24,850
2004 of a silicon bands in printed
with the words live strong.

402
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,350
