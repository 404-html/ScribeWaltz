00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:04,710
relatives.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,700
This scientist,

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,690
turns activist,

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,190
has devoted her life to understanding
and working to save chimpanzees from near

6
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:11,940
extinction.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,850
How Unorthodox methods of observation
revolutionized how scientists conducted

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,681
animal reception,

9
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:17,380
the wild,

10
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:17,850
deep,

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,840
long held assumptions about primates
behavior and showed the world how much we

12
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,730
have in common with the animal kingdom.

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,720
Let's learn more about the legendary
British primatologist ecologist,

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,420
anthropologist and UN messenger of peace.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,433
Jane Goodall,

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,691
Mary Jane Morris.

17
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,130
Scoodle was born in London,

18
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,300
England on April third,

19
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,230
1934.

20
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,820
She was the oldest of two girls,

21
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:51,680
born to farther mortimer and engineered
race car driver and two mother van,

22
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:55,520
a successful novelist exactly
four years following Jane's birth,

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,361
a younger sister,

24
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:58,670
judith was born and completed the family.

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,730
This API force and note it would
be short lived with World War Two.

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,710
You declared in England in 1939.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,590
Jane's father enlisted
and was posted to France.

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,280
From then on,

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,100
he would become a distant
figure in Jane's life only.

30
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,370
Rarely coming home when he was on leave
after the allies declared victory in the

31
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,090
war was over.

32
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,050
The good old marriage ended in divorce
a few years before Jane must have known

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,913
it was coming.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,080
The youngster wrote a
heartfelt letter to her father,

35
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,390
pleading him to wait until
she was 12 years old.

36
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,770
The divorce of Jane's parents,

37
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:28,100
method of greater impacts on her if her
mother hadn't been such an influential

38
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,420
and supportive parents.

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,190
Jane says it was her mother primarily.

40
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,470
This encouraged her to
live out our passions,

41
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,190
saying,

42
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,670
Jane,

43
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,980
if you really want something
and if you work hard,

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,600
take advantage of opportunities,

45
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,650
never give up.

46
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,390
You will somehow find a way.

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
My mother would later play a
role in Jane's early career,

48
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,890
traveling with Jane and
staying on the camp,

49
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:46,970
but the Gombe Reserve.

50
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,880
Jane spent the majority of her
childhood growing up in her maternal

51
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:50,930
grandmother's 18,

52
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,710
72 victorian house in the resort town
of Bournemouth on the south coast of

53
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:55,400
England.

54
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,290
They had a yard with a
garden and trees were.

55
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,350
Jane spent most of her free
time surrounded by women.

56
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:02,090
Jane shared the residents with her mother,

57
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,570
sister,

58
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,201
grandmother,

59
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,034
and two aunts.

60
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,590
It was a happy home and a place
good old now in her eighties,

61
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:09,410
goes back to when she needs
to relax and recharge.

62
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,240
She says all my childhood books,

63
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:11,751
the trees.

64
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:12,830
I climbed as a trials,

65
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,000
the cliffs where I walked.

66
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,470
I'm blessed in this way.

67
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,830
Young Jane Develops in early
fascination with wild animals.

68
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,900
Just over a year old Jane's father,

69
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,160
gifted tyree lifelike,

70
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:26,941
three foot tall,

71
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,290
stuffed chimpanzee that she affectionately
named jubilee and carried around with

72
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,124
her everywhere.

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,760
Jane's Mother's friends were quite
horrified by the toy chimpanzee fairing.

74
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:37,230
It would give the young toddler nightmare.

75
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,100
It's quite the opposite,

76
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:38,280
though.

77
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,530
Jane loved the toy and she still has it.

78
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,420
Over 80 years later being that Jane
devoted her life to researching and saving

79
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:45,960
chimps,

80
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,800
the only gift of stuffs chimpanzee
seems like the ultimate foreshadowing,

81
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,030
but Jane admits she is keen on all
animals and would have studied and other

82
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,400
species if the circumstances
had been different.

83
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,030
In fact,

84
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,660
as a go,

85
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,970
Jane did not limit herself to learning
about just one kind of animal.

86
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,780
Jane would often be outside the family
home and the yard quietly observing,

87
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,980
sketching or writing notes about
birds and other creatures have.

88
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,160
Family had a host of pets,

89
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,620
including a tortoise and
the dog and the young Jane,

90
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,720
so can many more including racing snails,

91
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,320
caterpillars,

92
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,550
the lizard and the canary.

93
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,840
Jane was an avid reader to some of her
favorite books included Dr doolittle.

94
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,100
Tarzan in the jungle book.

95
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,890
Reading these books ignited a desire to
go to Africa someday to observe and to

96
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,400
write about wild animals.

97
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,020
Jane was also a curious and patient
young step once when Jane was five years

98
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:32,400
old,

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,020
her parents could not find her errands,

100
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,863
presumed to missing.

101
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,760
As panic ensued in search began.

102
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,030
It turns out to Jane had been sitting in
the hen house waiting for the chickens

103
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:40,864
to lay eggs.

104
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,470
This quiet observation and persistence
is the hallmark of our good old would

105
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,840
later conductor research
at gone best stream.

106
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,100
While Jane entertains fanciful thoughts
of Africa and long to be outside in

107
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,610
nature,

108
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,600
she was still a young.

109
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,550
I'm enrolled at the
uplands private school.

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,390
By all accounts.

111
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,350
She was a good students,

112
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,930
but felt the routine of
the classroom unbearable.

113
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,860
At 16,

114
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,050
she confided in her diary writing,

115
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,760
woke up to be faced by yet
another dreary day of torture,

116
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,180
that gloomy place of discipline
and learning where one
is stuffed with education

117
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,070
from days dorn today's Eve,

118
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,460
despite these feelings that she managed
to embrace us school studies and

119
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,850
finished strong focusing her
interests in biology and English.

120
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,530
She even won two prizes for essay
writing in 1953 and at the urging of her

121
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:28,330
mother Jane and in the London's Queen
Secretarial College and graduated one year

122
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,310
later after receiving a qualification,

123
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,460
Jane held clerical jobs in
Bournemouth and Oxford University.

124
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,150
She also sometimes waited tables and
took a part time job with a film company

125
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,870
still.

126
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,640
Jane never gave up on her dream of going
to Africa even if the idea seemed far

127
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,563
fetched.

128
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,640
In 1955,

129
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,880
Jane Goodall received a letter from
Khloe and old school friends with an

130
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,800
invitation to come to Kenya.

131
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,450
The day had finally come.

132
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,910
It was the opportunity that
she had been waiting for.

133
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,820
She saved hard for the
fair and in March of 1957,

134
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,250
embarks on a three week journey by ship.

135
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,780
Soon after arriving in Kenya,

136
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,350
Jane took a job in the capital city of
Nairobi and demands of the famous British

137
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,160
paleontologist Louis liekly,

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,460
who was then the curator of
the Natural History Museum.

139
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,540
The museum,

140
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,060
Jane at this point was just 23 years old,

141
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,360
leaky assertive Charles Darwin's
theory of evolution and believed humans

142
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,710
originated in Africa.

143
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,250
He was motivated to find the missing link
and we're searching for just the right

144
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,880
person to study primates in the
wild rather than in captivity.

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
Researcher vapes in their natural habitat
has not been carried out before in

146
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,400
this manner and leaky soar in Jane,

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,450
the perfect candidate to conduct the
study not only need to Jane exhibit the

148
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,010
enthusiasm he was looking for,

149
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,270
but she also had the
temperament to sustain long
periods of time in the African

150
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,230
Bush with a mind,

151
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,840
uncluttered and unbiased by theory.

152
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,920
Up until this time,

153
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,940
good old has no formal scientific
training or academic credentials that

154
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,100
qualified her to conduct such a study.

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
Not to mention women scientists who
are practically unheard during the 19

156
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,060
fifties and sixties.

157
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,730
Nevertheless,

158
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,260
Blakey took a chance on the young woman
first hiring her as a secretary and then

159
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,930
sending out to the Gulf stream
reserve in Tanzania in 1960.

160
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,030
Jane was on her phd later in
1965 from Cambridge University.

161
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,240
The degree it would earn Jane respect
to the fields and an hour to receive

162
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,470
funding for research

163
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,530
in 1968 at the age of 26 Jane Google
Inbox for the gun best dream reserve now

164
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,720
part of the Gombe
National Park in Tanzania,

165
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,210
Uganda is bordered by the
longest lake in the world,

166
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,050
Lake Tanganyika in the Goma
region of the country in 1960.

167
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,310
When Jane began her research,

168
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,940
the forests have gumbo the parts of a
continuous chain throughout Burundi,

169
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,170
Rwanda and Uganda and scratched
Westwood's toothy Great Congo Basin.

170
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,880
Jane's destination was only accessible
by boat and as the land was characterized

171
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,550
by steep valleys and
lush green rain forests,

172
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,180
the African Bush and waters were
alive with many species of wildlife,

173
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,320
birds and fish today and remains one
of the best places on earth to observe

174
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,070
primates in their natural habitat.

175
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,080
Goodwill's mission was to learn everything
she possibly could about the wild

176
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,950
chimpanzees.

177
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,873
Arlene gone back.

178
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,550
Her mother accompanies her on the
trip for the first few months.

179
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,120
The local authorities believing a young
British woman would never survive alone

180
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,954
in the wilderness.

181
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,580
Bops labeled right though the dangers
of nature were less of a concern at the

182
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:16,930
time.

183
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,260
Civil war in the Congo had flooded
with refugees for several weeks.

184
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:21,650
Jane,

185
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,550
her mother runs one.

186
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:26,330
Kirk were forbidden to travel to the
stream and waited out the conflict in a

187
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,740
prison camp until it was safe.

188
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:28,250
Again,

189
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,990
thinking back on her first Dang gone bear.

190
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,660
Jane recalls looking up from
the shore to the forest,

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,330
hindering the apes and the
birds and smelling the plants.

192
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,890
I'm thinking it was very,

193
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,060
very unreal.

194
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,210
Jane's early attempts at getting
close to chimpanzees failed.

195
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,910
She could get no closer than 500 yards.

196
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,780
She found another trip and established
a pattern of consistent observation by

197
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:52,040
appearing in the same spot each morning
along the stream near the chimps feeding

198
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:52,700
area.

199
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,910
It was one male chimpanzee who
allowed Jane within close range.

200
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,520
She tempted him with your
banana and named him David,

201
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,890
graded for his white tufted chin.

202
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,080
Once does allow Jane to
get close and to watch him.

203
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,950
Other members of the group started to
feel comfortable and accept our presence.

204
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,210
No other human up until now
had ever gotten so close
to chimpanzees in the wild.

205
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,840
It would take two years for the chimps
to show no fear of her and she was

206
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:17,840
allowed to observe them almost
as if she was a chimp self.

207
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,860
Jane imitated them,

208
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,020
eat their foods and
spend time in the trees.

209
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,460
She would become closely acquainted with
over half of the 100 or so chimps in

210
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,270
the reserve.

211
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,010
Much of the horror of some scientists,

212
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,020
Jane gave all the chimps names like flow,

213
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:30,411
Fifi,

214
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:32,570
Flynn's and Mr Greg Hall at this time.

215
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,810
One was careful not to give human
characteristics to animals for fear of

216
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,280
engaging in anthropomorphism.

217
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,350
Researchers tended to use numbers instead,

218
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
good old would later recall,

219
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,000
these people were trying to
make ufology a hard science,

220
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,870
so they objected.

221
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,520
Choirs unpleasantly to my naming,

222
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,430
my subject sand for suggesting
that they have personalities,

223
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,180
minds,

224
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,013
and feelings.

225
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,010
Critics aside,

226
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,510
Jane continued to practice.

227
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,570
She believed that empathy was the key
to detecting slight changes in mood or

228
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,230
attitude,

229
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,220
and those changes could provide
insights into complex social processes.

230
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,670
Within weeks had gone bad,

231
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:11,480
Jane was making new discoveries in
turning conventional thought on its hat,

232
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,160
making tools and using tools was thought
to be an exclusive traits of humans and

233
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:16,994
not animals.

234
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,420
Yes,

235
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Jane witness David graded using a blade
of grass to extract termites from a

236
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,940
mountain stands on another occasion.

237
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,270
He stripped leaves from a twig to
gain better access to his prey.

238
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,870
This was the first recorded
time in history that another
species how to used or

239
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,300
modifying tools leaky.

240
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,260
It was so excited.

241
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,610
He famously exclaimed,

242
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,080
we must now redefined man redefined
tool or accepts chimpanzees as human.

243
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,640
He was surely exaggerating,

244
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:44,840
but the discovery was a major blow
to the notion of man the toolmaker.

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,850
A few weeks after the
toolmaking revelation,

246
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:50,300
Jane observed David [inaudible] eating
what looks like a piece of meat.

247
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,340
It was a piglets,

248
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,070
and so the long held theory of primates
as strictly vegetarians swelled.

249
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,830
That was also debunked
through Jane's observations,

250
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,270
the world would also learn chimps,

251
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:01,420
engaging cannibalism and warfare.

252
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,870
Jane witnessed a brutal four year war
with a neighboring tribe that devastated

253
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:06,500
the chimps.

254
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,370
MAILCHIMP's also routinely patrol the
borders of their territory and will attack

255
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:14,210
a solitary male chimpanzee from another
tribe in order to protect their area.

256
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,790
This dark side of chimpanzee behavior,

257
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,960
Jane Goodall likened to gang
activity living amongst the primates.

258
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:24,920
Jane observed that chimpanzees have
complex brains and social systems.

259
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,480
The caste system of chimpanzee society
places the dominant male at the top,

260
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,750
which is often ranked by how intense
his performances at feedings.

261
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,340
Over the course of her research,

262
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,670
Jane discovered chimps to develop
long term bonds with each other have

263
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:42,440
ritualized behaviors and even a
primitive language with 20 unique sounds.

264
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,430
Chimpanzees possessed
individual personalities and
communicate through touch and

265
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:47,264
body language.

266
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,950
They kiss and embrace each other,

267
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,030
give pats on the back,

268
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:50,870
shake their fists,

269
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:54,320
and engage in a whole variety
of other nonverbal ways.

270
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,140
Jay noted the males do not play
an active role in the family.

271
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,060
This is simply left up to the females.

272
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,540
Jane observed the strong bond in the
mother child relationship and it's found

273
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,390
that maternal instincts
are taught not inherent.

274
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,640
Chimpanzees learn through observation,

275
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,510
imitation,

276
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,900
and practice the chimpanzees with
good mothers who were above all else

277
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:14,720
supportive ended up being
good mothers themselves.

278
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,650
The ones who were poor ended up having
female offspring that was also poor,

279
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,820
mothering Jane even theorize that chimps
may have a sense of self and perhaps a

280
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:23,870
spiritual connection.

281
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,260
How research concluded that mother
centric groupings along with sex,

282
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:31,790
food sharing and grieving
all the essential components
of chimpanzee society.

283
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,110
Good old publication.

284
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,370
The chimpanzees have gone bad.

285
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:39,080
Patterns of behavior is the definitive
work on the behavior of chimpanzees.

286
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,410
It would have become the core body
of work used to establish chimps,

287
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,040
gorillas,

288
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,810
and had been as hominids.

289
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,290
The only discoveries of toolmaking and
meat eating chips and the idea of young

290
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,130
woman living in the jungle caught the
interest of national geographic and in

291
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:02,131
1962 they sent it to the dashing Dutch
photographer Baron Hugo Evon Loueke to

292
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,160
film her work,

293
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,080
fell in love while on assignments,

294
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,990
and as they were in 1960
for three years later,

295
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,830
they had their son,

296
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,663
you go junior,

297
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,450
who she called Grub life,

298
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,400
seemed idyllic for Jane,

299
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,540
doing what she loved most,

300
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,600
being with and writing about
chimpanzees and that were expelled.

301
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,530
This good old lens,

302
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:22,120
the wild chimpanzees ad in 1965 and
thrust Jane under the spotlight and that

303
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:26,350
same year Jane received her phd from
Cambridge even though it was his idea and

304
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,120
he pushed Jane to pursue her doctorate.

305
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,960
She acknowledged it was important saying
that Cambridge taught me to think in a

306
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,360
scientific way so I
could stand up to people.

307
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,040
It taught me to think logically.

308
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,650
I loved it and I loved analyzing the data.

309
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,170
It was a very important
part of my development.

310
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,530
Jane and Hugo's marriage
lasted a decade and my 1974,

311
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,940
the pack called it quits.

312
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,620
They remained on good terms.

313
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,580
She had married Derick Bryson member of
Tanzania and parliaments and director of

314
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,710
Tanzania national parks
the following year.

315
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,280
They had five good years together
until his death in 1980 from cancer.

316
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,170
Jane was devastated by the loss,

317
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,330
but she came to terms with us.

318
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,620
I went to Columbia and the
forest is very healing.

319
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,970
You get this endless cycle of living and
dying and things fell into perspective.

320
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,200
In 1971,

321
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,770
Jane Goodall published one of our most
popular and well known books in the

322
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,604
shadow of man.

323
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,000
A vivid description has brought the
chimps to life and bridged the gap between

324
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,200
science and entertainments.

325
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,860
Jane published many more books after
she able to professorship at Stanford

326
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,480
University and was appointed honorary
visiting professor of sociology at the

327
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,470
University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.

328
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,060
In 1977,

329
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,310
Dr Goodall founded the
Jane Goodall Institute,

330
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,090
Jay g,

331
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,230
I with a mission to protect
the chimpanzees and further
the research had gone

332
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:35,620
back.

333
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,380
These soft spoken Jane seems
and unlikely celebrity,

334
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,640
but she would find her
academic respectability and
its popularity and advantage

335
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:46,120
when speaking on behalf of the chimps
that she so loved over the course of our

336
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:46,891
research at gone,

337
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:49,450
bears became increasingly
clear that the wildlife there,

338
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,800
including the chimpanzees,

339
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,120
were at significant risk.

340
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,661
In fact,

341
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:53,560
by the 19 eighties,

342
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,750
chimpanzees were an endangered species.

343
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,680
Their home and resources were being
destroyed at an alarming rate.

344
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,220
After attending a conference organized
by the Chicago Academy of Sciences in

345
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:07,030
1986 to coincide with the publication
of the chimpanzees have Gumbo.

346
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,570
Goodwill found herself at a turning
point at 52 years old sounds.

347
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,610
After 25 years of field research,

348
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,970
Jane wins on the road to educate the
public on the vanishing habitats,

349
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,990
the bushmeat trade,

350
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,070
animal trafficking,

351
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,460
and the unethical treatment of animals
used in modern medicine and for

352
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,600
scientific research.

353
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,471
In 1990,

354
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,820
the revelation came that Jane must turn
her attention to humans in order to save

355
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,650
her chimps.

356
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,640
While flying over gone there,

357
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,000
she saw the hill stripped bare.

358
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:31,980
By deforestation,

359
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,410
the local villagers were responsible
having over farmed their lands.

360
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,580
We've listed options left,

361
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,060
they'd taken the trees and the national
park to sell his timber in order to

362
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:40,720
survive.

363
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,530
At that moment,

364
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,370
Jane realized that unless you address
poverty and to work to improve the lives

365
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,120
of villages,

366
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,530
you can never expect to conserve
the lands and save the wildlife.

367
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,030
She explained everything
is interconnected.

368
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,850
You learn that in the rainforest.

369
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,480
Soon off to the Jgi launched
programs focused on education,

370
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,211
family planning,

371
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,020
water management,

372
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,280
sustainable agriculture,

373
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,750
and microcredit for women.

374
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,341
Thanks to,

375
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:07,431
uh,

376
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,550
work with the Jane Goodall Institute's
Lake Tanganyika catchments,

377
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,830
reforestation and education projects.

378
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,640
The Gomberg chimps now have three to
four times more forest than they had 10

379
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,270
years ago.

380
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,421
Oh,

381
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:17,751
welcome.

382
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,500
The ethical treatment of captive chimps
that the medical community to steer away

383
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,020
from the using cross
species organ transplants,

384
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,040
also known as xenotransplantation.

385
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,810
Further goodall has made strides to phase
out the use of chimpanzees and medical

386
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:30,644
research.

387
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,600
Council works tirelessly an average of
300 days per year to spread the mission

388
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,590
of the Jgi.

389
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,790
The institute has offices around the
globe with programs primarily in Africa to

390
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,420
involve the local people in community
centered conservation and other

391
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:44,960
initiative.

392
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,730
The roots and shoots program
is an operation in over
130 countries and works to

393
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:52,850
foster environmentalism and
peace among the world's children.

394
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,430
Good old passionate fight
to preserve the welds.

395
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:59,270
Chimpanzee population has included
service on the save the chimps sport,

396
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,130
the world's largest chimpanzee sanctuary,

397
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,360
located in Fort Pierce,

398
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,170
Florida.

399
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,040
Over a long career,

400
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,620
good all became the
world's expert on primates.

401
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,000
Per field work has led to the publication
of numerous articles and five major

402
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:11,710
books.

403
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,420
She has also written a number of
children's books such as grubbed,

404
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,900
the Bush baby chimpanzees I love
and my life where the chimpanzees,

405
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,120
countless people over
multiple generations.

406
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:23,150
I've gotten to know her work through
the National Geographic magazine,

407
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,320
television programs,

408
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,340
and imax film,

409
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,240
Jane Goodall's,

410
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,470
wild chimpanzees,

411
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,940
Jane and new documentary film by Brett
Morgen was released in 2017 to critical

412
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:36,560
acclaim and features over 100 hours of
archived national geographic footage.

413
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,430
The trailblazer,

414
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,120
Jane Goodall,

415
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,910
is still captivating
audiences all this time later.

416
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,950
Good old has received
numerous honors and awards,

417
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,520
including the gold medal of conservation
from the San Diego Zoological Society

418
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,510
in Nineteen Seventy Four.

419
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,810
The J dot Paul Getty Wildlife
Conservation Prize in 1984,

423
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,430
the National Geographic Society,

424
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,500
Hubbard Medal for distinction
and then exploration,

425
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,010
discovery and research
in 1995 and in 2002,

426
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:10,810
she was named messenger of peace
by the United Nations in 2003,

427
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,500
she became a dame of the British empire.

428
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,700
And in 2006,

429
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:17,570
She was honored with the 60th anniversary
metal of the UNESCO and French Legion

430
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:18,110
of honor.

431
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,200
She also holds multiple honorary
doctorates from various prestigious

432
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,550
universities around the world.

433
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,530
Jane's research continues at the Bombay
Stream research center established by

434
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,850
good old in 1965.

435
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,630
It is the longest running study of
chimpanzees the world has ever seen.

436
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,080
The center hosts visiting researchers and
continues to further our understanding

437
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,000
of chimpanzee health group dynamics,

438
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,630
diet,

439
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,260
and more.

440
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,170
The information gathered here can
also inform conservation efforts.

441
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,450
These days dream visitor
center at least twice a year,

442
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,590
but all the trips screen
you have now passed on.

443
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,460
Jane's legacy is more than that.

444
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,580
Contributions to science or her activism,

445
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,570
how to termination and body of work
inspires us to believe in ourselves and

446
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,730
remember our connection to
nature and what we leave behind.

447
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,470
She wants us to think about the
future and our role in protecting us.

448
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,250
Saying,

449
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,960
I care passionately about nature.

450
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,760
I care passionately about children.

451
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
I have three grandchildren.

452
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,610
I think about their children.

453
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,170
If we can't do things differently,

454
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,810
what is the world going
to be like in 50 years?

455
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,860
Above all else,

456
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,130
Jane has taught us that it
is up to us to make a change.

457
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,390
Every individual matters.

458
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,700
Every individual has a role to play.

459
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,470
Every individual makes a difference.

460
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,050
Only if we understand what we care.

461
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,330
Only if we can.

462
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,383
Where we help?

463
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,640
Only if we help shall we will be saved.

464
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,380
The least I can do is speak out for those
who cannot speak out for themselves.

465
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,350
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

466
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,161
