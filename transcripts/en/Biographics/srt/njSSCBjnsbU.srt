1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,360
Is what was legendary.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,640
Here's literary work showed
signs of brilliance and his
lifestyle made him for a

3
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:07,750
time amongst the most celebrated artists,

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,650
so his age.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:08,960
Yes,

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,500
his spectacular fall was unprecedented,

7
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,250
only equals in modern
times by the disaster.

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,760
That was Oj Simpson.

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,331
Oh yes.

10
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,440
In this week's biographics,

11
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:21,850
we are diving into the Algebra righteous
life of the self proclaimed genius

12
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,990
Oscar Wilde.

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,280
I'll skip and go flat out.

14
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:43,281
He Wills Wilde into the weld on October
the 16th 1854 the flamboyance of his

15
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:43,961
name,

16
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,170
but was a portions of things to come.

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,921
His parents,

18
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,790
they were socially prominent
Anglo Irish Protestants,

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,790
each where the collective interest say
belief in national politics and take

20
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,500
publishing career of their own.

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,120
Oscar's father William was a renounced
physician specializing in the eye and yet

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,290
he was a slight on campus to figure
with an ugly beard and a roving eye,

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,790
but this absolutely did not
stop him carrying on numerous
affairs throughout his

24
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,090
marriage and he fathered
several illegitimate children.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,470
In contrast to our husband know Oscar's
mother Jane was especially elegant and

26
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:17,304
statuesque.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,060
She was almost six feet tall
and towered over our husbands.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,420
She was a woman who longed
to make a sensation,

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,240
one stating that I should
like to rage through life.

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,480
This Orthodox creeping is
too tame for me as well.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,650
You probably guessed that this was the
attitude that that her son would quickly

32
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:37,800
embrace when Oscar and her
second son was eight months old.

33
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,830
Jean described him as a great
stout creature who minds
nothing but growing fat.

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,250
Jane had actually wants to go in a set
to have dressed Oscar and treated him as

35
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,560
a daughter for the first
decade of his life.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,880
That's age nine Oscar,

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,840
along with his older brother,

38
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,111
Willie,

39
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,580
was sent to his first score,

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,920
the Portora royal boarding
school in Enniskillen foreign,

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,570
the Protestant north of Ireland's Oscar
was younger than most of his peers,

42
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:00,970
though.

43
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,360
At first he was a clips
by his older brother,

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,910
but by the time that Willie
was set to leave Portora,

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,700
he had been superseded
academically by Oscar.

46
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,270
In fact,

47
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,530
the younger Wilde was intellectually
far ahead of his classmates in 1889 he

48
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,310
recalls,

49
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,480
I always looked upon as a prodigy by my
associates because quite frequently I

50
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,870
would for a wager read a three
volume novel in half an hour,

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,741
so please submit.

52
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,800
Used to be able to give an accurate
resume of the plot of the story.

53
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,730
By one I was reading,

54
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,660
I was unable to give.

55
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:31,070
They fed a narrative of the incidental
scenes and it's the most person in

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,913
dialogue.

57
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,480
In 1871 wild won a scholarship to study
classics at Trinity College Dublin.

58
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,630
He arrived down in 1873 at the age of 18
there he was tutors and befriends is by

59
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,271
reverends.

60
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,110
John Pentlands,

61
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,030
Mahathey professor of ancient history.

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,680
Mahaffey inspired is be able to be
proficient in Greek and in 1875 he won the

63
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,090
prestigious but lead gold metal in Greek.

64
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,040
Three years later in 1874 Oscar sale
to England's take the examination for a

65
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,760
classic scholarship at Oxford
University while awaiting the results,

66
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:13,510
he went to London and was dazzled by
his first taste of the metropolis.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,171
After that,

68
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,660
he traveled to a nother
metropolis and that was Paris.

69
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,260
It was there with his mother and brother
that he received news that he had won

70
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,150
his scholarship and had not only one it,

71
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,270
but it achieved the highest
mark of the entire group,

72
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,691
Oscar,

73
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:28,210
that he absolutely made the
most of his time at Oxford.

74
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,510
It was during this time that he
cultivated his aesthetic sensibilities,

75
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,710
filling his room with lilies and spending
vast portions of his father's money

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,630
upgrading the deck or of his room.

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,940
It was at this time that he famously said,

78
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,960
I find it harder and harder every
day to live up to my blue China.

79
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,240
Whilst he was never a fan of sports,

80
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:49,630
but he did enjoy watching others
play crickets and also run.

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,890
He developed a reputation for his wit
proclaiming that the only possible

82
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,770
exercises to talk not to walk still,

83
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,420
he was absolutely no pushover.

84
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,290
It is believed that once while in his
room for undergraduates pounced on him to

85
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,190
beat him up and smashes belongings while
they said to have kicked out the first

86
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,830
interloper punched the second does,

87
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,710
he doubled over,

88
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,460
held the third through the end and it's
carried the last back to his own room

89
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,170
and then tossed him on the floor.

90
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,130
Now it was during his time at
Oxford that wilds became a mason.

91
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,480
He adopted the costume,

92
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,380
velvet breaches,

93
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:24,400
tailcoat white tie and silk hose
that is extravagant lifestyle.

94
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:28,480
It was ultimately dented in April
of 1876 when his father died.

95
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,980
Even a serious Das behinds Oscar though
he still managed to find a way to

96
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,090
indulge himself with semester holidays
around Europe just prior to his

97
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:42,091
graduation in 1878 he consult his mother
destroy too with financial worry that

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,300
we have genius.

99
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,820
That is something
attorneys can't take away.

100
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,140
Oscar the emerged from Oxford with a
degree and a clear vision of what was in

101
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,560
store in a remarkably
prophetic couple of sentences.

102
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,394
He declared,

103
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,730
God knows I won't be a
dried up Oxford don anyhow.

104
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,560
I can also live without desire.

105
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,760
Fair and pain,

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,720
self poised,

107
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,810
self centered and self
comforters are the a poet,

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,650
a writer,

109
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,483
a dramatist.

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,690
Somehow or other,

111
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll be famous and if not famous,

112
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,110
notorious.

113
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,290
In December of 1878 wild moved to London,

114
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,420
he shared a flat with Frank Miles,

115
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,800
a fellow Oxford graduate.

116
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,701
During this time,

117
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,410
he was introduced to many writers,

118
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,730
artists and actors.

119
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,840
He gained a reputation for is where's it
became a favorite dinner guest where he

120
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,850
would espouse his aesthetic values.

121
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,750
He applied for various fellowships and
even trying to become an inspector of

122
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:32,410
schools.

123
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,210
During all of this,

124
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,810
he was working on his first play,

125
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,371
Vera,

126
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:40,180
which he privately printed in 1880 vera
was a story of noble socialism set in

127
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,740
19th century Russia,

128
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,350
but it's unfortunately for Wilde's,

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,480
the New York and London
producers that he sent the Plato.

130
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,680
They turned it down.

131
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,860
In 81 Oscar published 61 pieces of writing
under the title poems and initial run

132
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,650
of 750 copies.

133
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:07,070
It's sold out with to further
printing runs being requires.

134
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,611
Meanwhile,

135
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,271
during all of this,

136
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,560
a play by the renowned team of Gilbert
and Sullivan was indirectly making wild

137
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,130
famous.

138
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,030
It was called patients and it was a
lampoon if the aesthetic culture that wild

139
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:22,031
epitomized the main character was
clearly model on him by June of 1881 wild

140
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:26,300
status which such that the Prince of
Wales comments as I do not know Mr Wilde

141
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,180
and to not to know Mr
Wales is not to be known.

142
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,370
Despite this ever growing reputation,

143
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,400
wild found himself in
tough financial straits.

144
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,170
He was offered and accepted a series of
lecture tours around America to coincide

145
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:41,210
with the New York opening of patients.

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,360
He set sail on Christmas Eve 1881 to
instruct the new world in the English arts

147
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:47,660
of Renaissance.

148
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,510
On arrival he told the
New York customs officer,

149
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,190
I have nothing to to clad.

150
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,180
That's my genius,

151
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,620
but don't try this today.

152
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,040
Anyone.

153
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,281
Well,

154
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:55,940
the Americans,

155
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,750
the were absolutely fascinated by him
and the original schedule was to be

156
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:03,170
extended repeatedly in order
to meet public demands.

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,430
It would last almost a year and it
would even extend to Canada financially.

158
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,091
He did very,

159
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,590
very well out of this tall.

160
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,560
He actually stayed in New York for
two months after the tours ends.

161
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,690
He then briefly returned to London in
January of 1883 before relocating to Paris

162
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:20,180
where he immersed himself
in artistic circles.

163
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,760
It was at this point that he
made himself over physically.

164
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,780
He had his long flowing locks transformed
into a bowl haircut and to took to

165
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,340
wearing a black overcoat.

166
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,960
This was increased contrast to the
flamboyance colors that he was previously

167
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:36,340
known for in May of 1883
wild or returned to London,

168
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,800
apparently motivated by his interest
in a woman named Constance Lloyd,

169
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,580
the daughter of a prosperous Lund
and lawyer for the last few years.

170
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,630
Despite here's American earnings is
Oscar have set and money worries,

171
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,180
variety.

172
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,880
Marriage would also solve those problems
while also answering the growing gossip

173
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,620
about his sexual character.

174
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,510
A year long courtship followed with the
marriage taking place on the 29th of

175
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,510
May,

176
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,930
1884 the couple they honeymooned in Paris
and then thanks to his new father in

177
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,930
law's money occupied a
four story house in London.

178
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,190
He then went ahead and had the
place redecorated at huge expense,

179
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,010
which plunged the newlyweds
into immediate debt.

180
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,120
Wild's first child Cyril
was born on the 5th of June,

181
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,010
1885 with Vivian following on November
the fifth 1886 with his writing career

182
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:22,711
going nowhere,

183
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:27,410
but he agreed to a British lecture tour
with topics such as the value of art in

184
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,220
modern life,

185
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,260
lecturing and other invitations.

186
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:34,640
They kept him away from his family home
a lot and during these long absences he

187
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:39,590
began to surround himself with young men
writing undauntedly of his infatuation

188
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:40,970
with the beauty of the male form.

189
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,150
He formed an especially close friendship
with a 17 year olds named Robbie Ross

190
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,460
during the late 1880

191
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,731
as well,

192
00:08:56,731 --> 00:09:00,480
bringing in money with occasional book
reviews at Wildworks on his first novel,

193
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,010
the picture of Dorian Gray when the book
was published in a magazine in 1890 it

194
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,720
caused an immediate scandal,

195
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,860
the storyline and involved
a subtly eroticize triangle
of relationships between

196
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,070
three men and it was condemned
by many as being immoral.

197
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,010
Whilst it predicted such an outcome
to having written the following.

198
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:17,844
In the preface,

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,580
there is no such thing as
a moral or immoral book.

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,860
Books are well written or badly written.

201
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,840
That is all it was around this time.

202
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:28,680
The wild was introduced to do a blondes
basket and undergraduates by the name of

203
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,240
Lord Alfred Douglas,

204
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,470
but he was known to his intimate,

205
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,333
says Boise.

206
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,040
Oscar quickly became
obsessed with a 22 year olds.

207
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,030
From this time on,

208
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,520
Oscar saw constants and
his children less often.

209
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,650
He did writings from rented addresses
or hotels usually with Boise and Tome

210
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,050
Boise's father was actually
the marquis of Queensbury.

211
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,350
Yup.

212
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,840
The man who developed the
rules of professional boxing.

213
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,430
He took an immediate and intense exception
to the relationship between his son

214
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:53,701
and his,

215
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:54,660
the famous whiles.

216
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,450
I bought it from the actual
aspect of their relationship.

217
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,230
Queensberry was enraged that wilder was
distracting his son from his studies at

218
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:01,980
Oxford.

219
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,690
When Boise quit his studies in May of
1893 the marquee became determined to

220
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,370
bring wild down,

221
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,480
but it was around this time that wild
finally achieved success on the stage or

222
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,530
woman of no importance,

223
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:18,300
so pins on April the 19th 1893 to
widespread a claim during its run.

224
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,330
It brought him between 170 and 200 pounds
per week is next play through satire.

225
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:28,530
An ideal husband was also successful
providing the means for Oscar and Boise to

226
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,870
travel widely and live extravagantly.

227
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,650
The Marquis of Queensbury thought his
son's failure to dig his degree in Oxford.

228
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,780
What was a scandalous waste of time?

229
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,960
He placed the blame squarely
at the feet of wild,

230
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,760
referring it to the relationship as
the most Lutherism and disgusting.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,340
Queensberry began absolutely
hounding the path.

232
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,160
He actually even threatened
to disinherit by seat.

233
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,350
So this the son replied with a telegram.

234
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:52,801
What are they?

235
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,730
Funny Little Man.

236
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,500
You are Queensberry not surprising.

237
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,180
They didn't like this one bit.

238
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,530
Ends on the 19th of June.

239
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,220
Queensbury burst in on wild at is
tied the street address in London.

240
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,600
He had a bodyguard with him.

241
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,990
Then it's proceeded to threaten bodily
harm unless the relationship ended

242
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:07,800
immediately.

243
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,630
So what was Boise's reactions all of this?

244
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,021
Well,

245
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:11,790
he wrote nonchalantly to his father.

246
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,720
I write to inform you that I treat
your absurd threats with absolute

247
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,770
indifference.

248
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,760
The encounter though,

249
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,630
it's unsettled.

250
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:22,410
Wild who got out of London for several
months going on a holiday with his family

251
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:25,560
to where then this is where
he works on his latest play,

252
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,510
the importance of being earnest,

253
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,010
but it wasn't before Boise,

254
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,120
unable to stay away,

255
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,650
invited himself along.

256
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
And as you might imagine,

257
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:37,800
this caused a little bit of
tension between Mr and Mrs Wiles,

258
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,790
the importance of being earnest
opens to great applause.

259
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,940
On February the 14th 1895 do weeks later.

260
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,600
It was already a wild success and
in through Oscar Wilde's style,

261
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,520
he began basking in the glow of this.

262
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,170
It was at this that wild calls
in at the lavish Albermarle club.

263
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,140
There he was handed a card
from Queensbury by a port APP.

264
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,100
On this card was scrawled do
Oscar Wilde posing sodomite.

265
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,940
That's Boise's urging wild
when's a Margaret Street
police station to ask for a

266
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,850
warrant for Queens.

267
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,670
Barry's arrest on the grounds of Lidl.

268
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,530
The case came to trial on April the
third prosecuting counsel Leadwood Carson

269
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:17,530
and put on the stand a 16 year old boy
who claimed had been paid for sex by

270
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,260
wiles.

271
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,970
Carson then went on to dissect
works published by wild revealing.

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
They're supposed homosexual undertones,

273
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,250
so malady wilds reacts to
this rather serious events.

274
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,641
Well,

275
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:31,240
he chose to wield his celebrated
wit as his main defensive tool.

276
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,200
He was often funny,

277
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,420
but the implicit
superiority in his position,

278
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,350
it was also damaging in one exchange when
Carson asked whether the affection and

279
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:42,100
love that is portrayed in the picture
of Dorian gray might lead an ordinary

280
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,890
individual to believe it had
a sort of medical tendency.

281
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,910
Oscar replied,

282
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,580
I have no knowledge of
the ordinary individual,

283
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,550
which didn't exactly inderam to anyone.

284
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
Wilds council and Edward Clarke,

285
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:53,441
we'll say,

286
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:57,070
made serious miscalculations
that did his clients no favors.

287
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,370
He went over the letters
of the Queensberry had sent
his son in an attempt to

288
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,890
show how crazy the father
had become to the jury.

289
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:06,850
Though queens breeze volatility was
driven by a paternal regard for Boise's

290
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,480
character as Carson budget.

291
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,060
His clients had one hope alone and that
was simply saving his son on the third

292
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:16,700
day of proceedings with things not
exactly going brilliantly wild.

293
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,070
He chose not to attend.

294
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,170
This was to prove the most damaging day.

295
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:24,190
Yet with Carson announcing
that he intended to introduce
saying number of boys

296
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,370
who would testify to shocking
acts performed by Oscar.

297
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,030
Now without consulting his clients.

298
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:29,571
While it's lie,

299
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,420
a Clark offered to abandon the case.

300
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,841
The defense,

301
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:32,320
however,

302
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,510
insisted that the original the stamps,

303
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,500
the judge agreed and compelled and
acquittal from the jury Queensberry he was

304
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,790
found not guilty of libel.

305
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,400
Against wiles is it now
been proven that is written.

306
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,770
Accusation of sodomy was not libelous,

307
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,500
but now there was another
important consequence.

308
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,490
It left wild,

309
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,680
highly vulnerable to arrest for sodomy,

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,710
which was a crime at that
time in England and well,

311
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,740
this is exactly what happens at
five in the evening of the day,

312
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,180
the libel case was decided.

313
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,880
A summons was issued for
the arrest of Oscar Wilde's.

314
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,860
The charge was committing acts of gross
indecency hiding in the Catagen hotel.

315
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,640
Oscar was urged by Boise and others
to take a boat immediately for France.

316
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,470
Even his wife told him to run.

317
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,161
However,

318
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,290
this just didn't sit right with whales.

319
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,630
He was determined to stand
his ground and declaring,

320
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,670
I shall stay and do my sentence,

321
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,600
whatever it is.

322
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,580
At 6:10 PM do detectives
arrived and to our case,

323
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,550
semi drunk wilds to both street station.

324
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,670
The arrest of Oscar Wilde
caused an absolute sensation.

325
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,460
Any friends that he still
has quickly drifted away,

326
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,020
both of is currently running place.

327
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:35,050
They were canceled and his
name very quickly became toxic.

328
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,880
Wilder was captain a cell in both street,

329
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,170
which was that in Holloway prison,

330
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,160
Queensbury now administered the low blow
or forcing a bankruptcy sale of Oscar's

331
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,860
belongings helped by a long
list of angry creditors.

332
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,700
By this time,

333
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,230
wild was about $6,000 in debt after
making sure that Oscar had nothing of any

334
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,064
physical value,

335
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,310
Queensberry wrote to a newspaper denying
that he was capable of any sympathy for

336
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:55,940
wiles.

337
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,120
He stated I've helped to
cut out then destroy shocks.

338
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,380
I have no sympathy for them,

339
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,950
but it felt sorry and wished to put
them out of pain as fast as possible.

340
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,520
The trial,

341
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,731
well,

342
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,220
it ran from the 26th to the 29th of April.

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,030
It was extraordinarily explicit
in its illusions to sexual acts.

344
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,020
Many coming from the young men who claimed
to have been partakers various Savoy

345
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,350
hotel employees testified that
they had seen boys in Wilde's bed.

346
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:18,800
However,

347
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,400
Oscar's council was able to point out
the contradictions in testimonies,

348
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,430
especially those if the rent's boys.

349
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,880
This all meant that the jury,

350
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,530
they were unable to reach a verdict,

351
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,060
but wild he was not out of the woods
as an almost immediate retrial began

352
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,380
between the two trials.

353
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,970
He did manage to secure a bale,

354
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,930
though stiffed conditions were imposed.

355
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,660
He tried to stay at a number of hotels.

356
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,940
I need to be told to teach
that he was unwelcome.

357
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,240
You finally managed to find
lodgings with his brother Willie.

358
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,231
The second trial.

359
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,600
It began on May the 20
seconds at the Old Bailey.

360
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,910
This time after two hours of discussion,

361
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,340
the jury returned with
a verdict of guilty.

362
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,443
The sentence,

363
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,700
all it would be two years of hard labor.

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,710
Walter was taken to pens and Phil prison,

365
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,050
the woods in bed in his
cell has sheets and rugs,

366
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,350
but no mattress at 10 parts
was provided for his toilet.

367
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,453
The prison glades.

368
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,300
They were also not exactly
his accustomed style of dress.

369
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,410
While it was also compelled to walk on
a treadmill senselessly for six hours

370
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,620
each day until now to exercise
outdoors for one hour.

371
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,190
He was also forced to make a
postal bags for three whole months.

372
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,850
He had no outside contact and after that
things were not much better with him

373
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,740
only being allowed to write one letter.

374
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,020
The regime was absolutely brutal.

375
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,720
Wildrick calling three
punishments authorized by law,

376
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,440
hunger,

377
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,273
insomnia,

378
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,060
illness.

379
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,530
In September of 1895 he received a visit
from Constance who found the experience

380
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,650
awful more so than any
conception of it could be.

381
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,180
Constance report it that wilds professed
a rejection of his former conduct and

382
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,510
begged her for forgiveness for his
madness during the last three years.

383
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,170
She decided to stands by her
week rather than wicked spouse.

384
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,590
Still she abandoned his name
referring to herself as constants.

385
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:00,424
Holland.

386
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,880
When Boise heard about Oscar is
rejection of his form of lifestyle.

387
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,900
He was heartbroken.

388
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,710
He wrote,

389
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,640
I am not in prison,

390
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,760
but I think I suffer as much
as Oscar and in fact more.

391
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,190
That was probably not the case
though because I mean prison.

392
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,900
It was obviously pretty rough.

393
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,660
In October,

394
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,360
he actually came down with dysentery.

395
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,350
Then on November the 21st he was
transferred to Redding prison as Clapham

396
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:21,220
junction station.

397
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,680
He was spat on and
ridiculed by the crowds.

398
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,970
Here are the conditions.

399
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:25,840
They were improved,

400
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,340
I just duties they were lighter.

401
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,660
He was finally released.

402
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,490
On May the 19th 1896 Oscar was booked
into the hotel sandwich in d app in

403
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:34,324
northern France,

404
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,150
living off the generosity of the
few friends who had stood by him.

405
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,750
By now,

406
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,170
constants had designed it on divorce
and suffering herself with spinal

407
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:41,970
paralysis,

408
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,360
had put it off any reunion.

409
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,410
Between June and July of 1897
Oscar wrote his last major work,

410
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,450
the ballad of reading the subjects as
well that was underlining the need for

411
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:55,020
reform in Britain's prison and
justice systems like in the APP.

412
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,080
It was excruciatingly lonely
for Oscar society at large.

413
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:01,230
Shuns him and he spent day
after day alone and miserable.

414
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,520
Finally has resolved,

415
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:03,160
collapsed hymns.

416
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,520
He wrote to Boise inviting
him to come and stay.

417
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,080
They reconciled on August the 28th with
wild bursting into tears at the site of

418
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:11,130
his one true love.

419
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,470
When Constance heard of
her husband's behavior,

420
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,760
she wrote to him up for bidding and
he return to your filthy insane life.

421
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,320
When he refused to give our Boise,

422
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,760
she cut him off completely.

423
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,710
Once the initial passion subsided,

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,610
it became clear that to both wild and
Boise were different than their pretrial

425
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,270
selves.

426
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,810
Boise,

427
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,710
he felt a duty to help wild but
this was no longer tied to love.

428
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,690
On December the third Boise left for
Naples and did not return Oscar's last two

429
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,140
years,

430
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,040
mostly in Paris.

431
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,903
They were pitiful.

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,030
He drank hired men and
bagged acquaintances.

433
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,230
They were few constants.

434
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:47,250
Oland sadly died at age 40 after an
operation on her back on April the seventh

435
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,740
80 98 then in April,

436
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,860
1900 wild went with an acquaintance
named Harold matters to Rome where he

437
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,060
received the pope's blessing.

438
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,150
A month later he was in Paris
and suffering from ill health,

439
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,860
which he attributed to food poisoning.

440
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,710
His skin was irritable and then
frequently came out in rashes.

441
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,723
By September.

442
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,690
It was completely bed ridden on October
the 10th it was operated on for an ear

443
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:07,350
infection.

444
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,981
The operation,

445
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,350
it did not go well and he got worse still.

446
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,710
He did insist on continuing
to drink absent fan champagne,

447
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,060
I'll November the 25th they diagnosis
of acute inoperable cerebral meningitis

448
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,530
was reached from here on,

449
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:24,120
Oscar drifted in and out of consciousness
and even sanity at half past five the

450
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,600
following morning at death rattle
began minutes after his demise,

451
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,700
his body actually sort of exploded.

452
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,180
Fluid pouring out of several RF assists.

453
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,180
Oscar Wilde's,

454
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,910
well he died as he had
lived in appropriately,

455
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,770
outrageously and with scans
reference to watch decorum demanded.

456
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,090
So I really hope you found
that video interesting.
