1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,650
He was the father of fascism,

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:06,000
the iron fisted dictator who ruled
Italy for more than two decades.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,863
During that time,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,040
he punched his country into disaster
forming an alliance with adult Hitler and

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,900
is bringing the wrath of the wells and
his own people upon him. In the end,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,570
his own citizens express their own
roofless verdict on the man who called

7
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:21,600
himself. He'll do chain and
this week's biographics.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,700
We track the life and the
death of Benito Mussolini.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,950
Benito, I'll mill, could I and dre. And
Mussolini was born on the 29th of July,

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,030
1883 and a small village near
the northern Italian town of pet.

11
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,900
Happy Yo in the province of folly.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,530
His father and rather Sandra was a
blacksmith and an atheist who was heavily

13
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:54,940
involved in socialist politics while his
mother Rosa was a devout Roman Catholic

14
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,520
school teacher with his
parents divergent beliefs.

15
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,960
The young Mr Linny was raised to put his
faith in both Karl Marx and the pope.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,590
His mother took him to mass several times
a week while his father dragged him to

17
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,770
the pub to learn from his
socialist friends from the start.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Benito proved to be an aggressive and
rebellious child and later life he

19
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,010
recalled I was not a good boy.
I was,

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,180
I believe on really by the time he was
eight Mussolini was spending long hours

21
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:20,680
helping us father in the furnace.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,060
Here he would listen to Alessandra is
socialist ideas and these words are mold

23
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:28,330
his future philosophy,
but the wise heart was with his mother.

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,010
He feared displeasing, Huh? Yes. This
did not curb his way with tendencies.

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,910
By the time he was nine Raisa had become
so exasperated with Benito that she

26
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:41,680
sends him to a school run
by Roman Catholic monks in
order to instill some much

27
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,520
needed discipline.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,770
The defines Benito Chafed at the strict
discipline and his behavior became even

29
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:48,460
worse.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,330
He got into a number of fights and was
eventually expelled when he took on one

31
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:53,800
of the monks,
Rosa,

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,370
no center wayward son to a less
strict school closer to home.

33
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,420
This though it did nothing to improve
his behavior and his before long he was

34
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:01,990
expelled.

35
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,820
This time for threatening
and other students with a
knife has exasperated mother

36
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,720
nine inch to find a third school where
he managed to see artists schooling or

37
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:14,350
the age of 17 Benito completed his
10 years of compulsory schooling.

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,110
His main accomplishments over that
time web, not really academic.

39
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:20,740
Rather he learned how to play the
trombone and speak in public. However,

40
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,970
despite his poor academic record in
1901 he qualified as a school teacher,

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,760
but he seemed discovered that
teaching did not suit him.

42
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,170
He was far more interested in the two
passions that he had inherited from his

43
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:36,970
father, socialism and womanizing. The
18 year olds. Benito was a strong,

44
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:40,750
handsome man with a forceful
personality and a certain charisma.

45
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,680
He easily drew the attention of young
women, often the wives of other men.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,340
There's often resulted in him having
fistfights with people's husbands,

47
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,740
often less than a year muscly,

48
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,590
and he had lost his teaching job after
getting into a violence arguments with no

49
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,600
money and it's very visceral prospects.
He moved to Switzerland.

50
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,410
He worked in eight succession of manual
jobs to support himself within a short

51
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,260
time he had attached himself
to a group of Marxists.

52
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,850
He also joined a trade union.

53
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,270
Nan's began attending rival political
rallies where he would hack all the

54
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,790
sneaker and start fights
with those in the crowd.

55
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,310
As a result of these political agitations,

56
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,490
Benito was arrested and deported
back to Italy several times,

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,540
but each time he returned to Switzerland's
more determined than ever to keep

58
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,340
Stuttering v political pot.

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,070
[inaudible] struggle to make
ends meet and Switzerland.

60
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,910
On one occasion he accosted two elderly
women on the street and stole food for

61
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:38,080
them. In his 1928 auto biography. He
related that if the women had struggles,

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,310
he would have strangled them.
In 1904 he returned to it to the end,

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,550
he joins the Italian army he served
out has compulsory 18 months,

64
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,030
10 months into his military service.
Miscellaneous beloved mother Rosa.

65
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,380
She died a distraught of Benito laser
called this the greatest sorrow of his

66
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:53,920
life.

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,180
He was discharged from the
army in September of 1906
he had clearly not learned

68
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,990
discipline while in this country
service as his life now revolved around

69
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,120
drinking,
womanizing and fighting,

70
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,470
he managed to gain employment as a teacher
again with a succession of temporary

71
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:16,200
contracts. During this period
prior to the first world war,

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,100
listening to his moral character
deteriorated as socialists socialist ardor

73
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:20,760
increased.

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,180
He wrote four and edited several
Socialists newspapers running against the

75
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,820
government, the democratic
system, the middle classes,

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,450
and the church and one pamphlets
incisal to God. It does not exist.

77
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,460
He rose to the priests were black
microbes who are as faithful to mankind as

78
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:39,060
tuberculosis germs when it's
entered in a war against Libya.

79
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:43,320
In 1911 Mysoline he led the internal
criticism against the government's actions

80
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,660
through his newspaper writings.
He's outspoken.

81
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,080
Opposition led to his arrest and
it's a five month imprisonment. Yes,

82
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,540
his fist shaking public
opposition to the government.

83
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,920
I'd also gone to the attention of the
country's top socialist leaders who looked

84
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,090
on admiringly.

85
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,180
The young Benito Mussolini was viewed
by them as a rising star of the left in

86
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:04,980
December of 1912 shortly
after his release from prison,

87
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,580
but he's was appointed editor of the
country's national socialist newspaper

88
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,750
goals,
Avanti.

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,980
It was a natural fit and within six
months is firebrand style of journalism.

90
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,990
I had increased the papers readership
five fold now have a national forum with

91
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,520
which to air is for use.

92
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,850
When war broke house in 1914 Mr Leni
held firm non-interventionist views.

93
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,540
He saw war as anti-socialist does it
pitted the working classes of one nation

94
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,080
against those of another.
Within months he had changed his view.

95
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,540
He now saw war is an
opportunity for revolution.

96
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,620
He now used his voice through the pages
of Avante to call on the young men of

97
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:49,520
Italy to join the army. What's the name
is about face on the war situation,

98
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:53,000
put him at odds with more moderate
socialists leaders and resulted in his

99
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,810
expulsion from the party and it's the
loss of, is that a ship of the paper?

100
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,210
Defiantly he started his own newspaper,

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,320
ill popular Italia or
the people of vessels.

102
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,270
This paper ran continuously from November,

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,100
1914 it's almost Selenis
removal from power.

104
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,100
29 years later in his first editorial,

105
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:15,020
he proclaimed the famous line blood
alone moves the wheels of history.

106
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,260
Around this same time,
Mr Leni founded his first political party,

107
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,540
the FASC over revolutionary action.

108
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,440
This was soon simply known as the
fascist party, the main allied powers,

109
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,120
Britain and France supported Mussolini,

110
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,810
seeing him as a key to getting Italy
more involved in the war effort.

111
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,110
They provided much needed
financial support to the new party.

112
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,670
The British secret service, even paid
muscly need a wage of 100 pounds per week.

113
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,420
In July of 1915 is at least signs the
treaty of London committing itself to

114
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,930
fighting alongside the allies
against Germany. But it isn't.

115
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,060
These war soon became a fiasco.

116
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,470
It was plagued by poorly trained and
experienced officers and unwilling

117
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,790
belligerent conscripts.

118
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,900
They became bogged down and a battle
of attrition against Austria, Hungary.

119
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,160
By the time it was all over,

120
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,190
more than 650,000 Italians would add
half a million we're missing and nearly a

121
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,990
million.
Where we ended was Eleni himself.

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,860
[inaudible] joined the army in September
of 1915 he attained the rank of

123
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:12,800
corporal winning a claim for his
bravery and devotion to his men.

124
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,940
On February the 20 seconds 1917 he
was in a trench when one of his fellow

125
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,410
soldiers grenades exploded.

126
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,730
He was badly wounded requiring numerous
operations over the course of the next

127
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,150
month, and then he was sent
home to recuperate, was the,

128
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,090
his message now morphed from socialism
and the plate of the working man to

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,420
patriotism as the cause
of ultra nationalism.

130
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,963
Okay.

131
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,800
During the postwar talks in Paris,
Italy,

132
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,960
it was treated dismissively
by the major powers,

133
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,950
the territories that she had been promised
to during the 1915 treaty of London

134
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,650
when not handed over the
Italian prime minister,

135
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:52,280
Vittoria Orlando walked out of
the conference in total disgust.

136
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,780
Orlando bore the brunt of the public
discontent and we're soon removed from

137
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,370
office and the following elections,

138
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,460
miscellaneous fascist party
failed to win a single seat.

139
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,180
His political rivals made fun of this
staging and mock funeral for the party

140
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,650
chief among his adversaries,

141
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,280
where the Socialists Seward won a third
of the seats in parliament and ticking.

142
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,640
Most Illini was now firmly opposed
to over the next three years.

143
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:17,570
The political situation and instantly
was extremely unstable with four prime

144
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,160
ministers and coalition governments.

145
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,650
None of these was able to yield
any real power. The country.

146
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:26,630
It was in a state of near anarchy with
the rampant inflation and unemployment is

147
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,290
driving people to total despair.
Mussolini's Fascist, stressed,

148
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,290
and they're intimidating black
shirts rooms through the streets,

149
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,360
seeking out and beating up socialists,

150
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:39,200
communists or anyone who they didn't
like the look of the police who have

151
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:43,040
sympathy for the fascists usually stood
by and let muscle in his mat and get

152
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,874
away with it.

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,880
On May the 15th of 1921 national elections
were held this time the fascists join

154
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:51,560
day coalition of rightwing parties,
the national block,

155
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,670
and as the one that 35 seats out of the
total of 535 in the house of parliament.

156
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,910
Mussolini himself gained a seat
and the Chamber of Deputies,

157
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,470
he was now an official member of the
Italian government realizing that he now

158
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,910
needed to broaden his base.

159
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,110
Most of the knee did an about face on
a couple of is underpinning principles.

160
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,940
He became both pro Monica pro church,
but his hatred of socialism.

161
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,830
That certainly remains.

162
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,480
Mussolini renames the potty now calling
it the national fascist party is

163
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:25,560
reputation began to grow and he became
known as a man with the ability to rule

164
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:30,360
with a firm hands and restore order amidst
the chaos that Italy had fallen into,

165
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,050
public opinion was actually
beginning to turn in his favor.

166
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,500
That popularity was bolstered when
Mussolini's black shirts broke up his

167
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:42,030
socialist back strike in October of
1922 at a rally. Shortly thereafter,

168
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,030
Mosley need declared in the speech that
either the government would hand over

169
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,580
power to him or he would
seize it for himself,

170
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,870
and this was no idle bluster with no
sign of capitulation by the government.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,250
Mussolini decided to stage a coup
by marching on Rome. His forces,

172
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:59,730
though they were no match for the Italian
army, but still the prime minister,

173
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,200
Luigi factor offered Mussolini a position
in his government in order to avoid

174
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:09,090
conflict. The offer was roundly rejected
and the fascists marched on the capital.

175
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,660
The panics.

176
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,020
Prime Minister urged the king to
allow him to use the army to quash the

177
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,400
rebellion.
The king agreed.

178
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,180
He quickly changed his mind fairing
that a civil war with breakouts,

179
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,780
there's enraged the prime minister who
ultimately resigned from his office.

180
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,190
The 28,000 fascists marching on the
Capitol stops 20 miles north of the city.

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,650
That half of them left
to often written time.

182
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,370
The rest carries on with Mussolini
himself joining them at various points to

183
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:35,970
have his photo taken at the front of the
line. But with the rain pouring down,

184
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,310
he was content to leave the
heavy marching to others.

185
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,410
And took an express train and Rome,

186
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,850
the king who secretly admired Mussolini
now tried to play Katen by offering him

187
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,620
a governmental role.
Mussolini,

188
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:49,590
though he would consider nothing
but the prime ministership.

189
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,720
Eventually the king
offered him the position.

190
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,970
By Age 39 muscle Ini had become prime
minister, not through violence revolution,

191
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,860
but through threat bluster and unequivocal
demands in the wake of his victory.

192
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,360
Ecstatic fascists rooms the streets in
search of downhearted socialists that

193
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,570
they could terrorize.
Mm.

194
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,590
Mussolini was now both Prime
Minister and foreign minister,

195
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,830
but his government was very much a
majority in the house of parliament.

196
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,560
This forced him to work within
the confines of democracy,

197
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:25,460
which left and at the mercy you if the
majority coalition this though it was not

198
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:28,640
a situation that the power hungry
autocratic would tolerate for very long.

199
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,050
Within eight weeks of assuming office
muscle lenient forms of the fascist grand

200
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:33,770
council,

201
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,970
the grand council acted as a conduit
between the fascists and the Chamber of

202
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:41,600
deputies filled with his hand,
picked appointees. It was in effect,

203
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,950
a mouthpiece for most Illini,

204
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,610
which effectively lessens the
power of parliament to act.

205
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,260
In 1923 the grand council passed a law
that rigged the electoral system to

206
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:55,510
ensure that the fascists gains a
sizable majority in the next election.

207
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,610
When the election was
held the following April,

208
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,590
the fascists won 374 of the 535 seats.

209
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,740
This new law had certainly helps
them gain the 70% majority,

210
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:10,090
but sue did the vigilance presence of
miscellaneous black chefs who co asked the

211
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,870
public to vote for the fascists. In
addition, opposition party meetings,

212
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,150
we're broken up and the
candidates were beaten.

213
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,670
In the wake of this
overwhelming electoral victory.

214
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:23,140
Socialists leader Jack Mo matter Yachty
openly it denounced the fascists and

215
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,260
their leader. 11 days later,
Matty Yachty was assassinated.

216
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,610
This led to nationwide protests against
most lenient is party of thugs with many

217
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:34,200
people are calling on the king to
depose the Prime Minister Fears Boston.

218
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,900
What's Illini plaid innocence and acted
shocked and revolted by the murder.

219
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,630
He did his best to to distance
himself from the crime.

220
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,980
Still politicians from
all parties responded by
withdrawing from parliaments in

221
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,740
an effort to force miscellaneous
ejection from office,

222
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,830
but the king refuse to get rid of most
of the knee and a vote of confidence.

223
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:55,150
On January the third 1925 a few of the
prime minister's opponents showed up

224
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,110
after the opportunists team now took
the opportunity to cement his absolute

225
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,770
authority.

226
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,240
He declared that only the fascists could
provide stability in the country and it

227
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,400
would be achieved through dictatorship.

228
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,980
That's the most Selenis propaganda
machine infiltrated every area of Italy.

229
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,230
A cult of personality develops around him.

230
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,610
People consider them to be a genius man
of action, but one with a common touch.

231
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,580
When things went well, it was all
thanks to all [inaudible] the leader.

232
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,610
However it when things went wrong,
it was never his fault.

233
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,180
He was a mesmerizing speaker.
He used facial expressions and gestures.

234
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,340
Do you capture and then
throw all his audience.

235
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,930
He stood at only at five foot six inches
and likes to dress and striped trousers

236
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:41,080
and shirts with butterfly colors.
He was not a well man,

237
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,840
physically suffering from
ulcers and stomach upsets.

238
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,480
His health problems forced him
to give up smoking and drinking.

239
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,830
I'm beginning to lose his hair.

240
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,080
In his late twenties he
took just shaving his hat.

241
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,650
He was also short sighted
to vent wear glasses.

242
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,830
What's the Leni spend the next two
years dismantling democracy and so they

243
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:00,310
understand wishing his own
totalitarian regime. During that time,

244
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,600
he instilled three key messages into
the public consciousness, believe,

245
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,890
obey and fight.
This message gained widespread approval.

246
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,690
Even many former socialists now turn
to fascism the farm hands of the state.

247
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,990
We're seen as the only
solution to the country's woes.

248
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,530
All forms of criticism of the state
where bands and opposition parties were

249
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:24,910
disbanded was Leni himself,
was answerable only to the king.

250
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,940
Spies were everywhere and he
gets a report to the authorities.

251
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,530
Anyone who spoke or acted against the
state during the 1920 is the fascists have

252
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:35,440
made modest improvements in
the Italian economy. However,

253
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,800
all of this was over turns with the
global depression that followed the Wall

254
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:42,160
Street crash in October
of 1929 once again,

255
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,410
the country went into a
state of economic chaos.

256
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,040
What's the lenient responded by embarking
on foreign invasions during the 1930s

257
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,550
he's sent armies into Libya, Ethiopia
and Spain. Italy's invasion of Ethiopia.

258
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:53,691
Yeah.

259
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:58,691
Began in 1935 and resulted
in a devastating occupation
that would continue until

260
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:02,870
1941 when the British army forced
the Italians out. During that time,

261
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,520
it has been estimated that 8% of
Ethiopia's population was put to death.

262
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,760
Mussolini. You ordered that the
male populations of entire towns,

263
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:14,750
the wipes out if EOP is leader Haile
Selassie was forced to flee to England's

264
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,670
where he petitions the United Nations.

265
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,440
This infuriated by selenium and sent him
into the arms of a neighboring dictator

266
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,540
by the name of adult Ed Blah.

267
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,060
On May the 20 seconds, 1939 Hitler
and Mussolini signed a Pact of steel.

268
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,800
This man's that they promised to come to
each other's aid in the event of walk.

269
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,040
Less than four months later up Germany
invaded Poland igniting world war to

270
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,461
whistler.

271
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:46,360
Leni approved erratic in its response to
the prospect of fighting a European war

272
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,650
alongside the Nazis. On the very day
that Germany invaded, Poland is Mysoline.

273
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,950
He announced to his cabinets because
he had decided not to fulfill his

274
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:57,700
obligation from the pact of steel on
the basis that Germany has signed a

275
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:01,840
nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union
and act that violated the providers of

276
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:02,530
the pact.

277
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,040
The truth was that muscle meaning you
had absolutely no confidence and it's

278
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,720
country's readiness for war,
despite his announcement to his cabinet,

279
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,840
most of them, and you continue to put
up a pretense of support for headlamp.

280
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,480
However, in private, he spoke of joining
the British and French coalition.

281
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,330
Finally on June the 10th,
1940 with the Nazi's looking,

282
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,560
I should have an easy victory over the
French Mussolini declared war on Britain

283
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,394
and France,

284
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,880
Italian troops where I quickly sent to
France in order that Mr he could have

285
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,610
some share in the spoils of victory.
At the same time,

286
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,640
he mobilized forces into Africa
to attack British Holdings.

287
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:37,840
That large scale forces were sent into
Egypt while other divisions focused on

288
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:39,100
Greece.
At the same time,

289
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,920
Mr meaning it was overseeing the air force
as they joins with the Nazi Luftwaffe.

290
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,460
Uh,
in the battle of Britain in every theater,

291
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,440
the ill prepared Italian forces were
driven back or stalemated this enraged at

292
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:53,800
la who was forced to send German
troops in to save the Italians.

293
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,060
By the beginning of 1942, it was a
Paris, Italy was fighting a losing war.

294
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,120
They were badly beaten in
Egypt at the battle of Al Amin,

295
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,750
and the allied invasion of French north
Africa pushed them further back on their

296
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:08,410
heels. The allied invasion of
Sicily was the final Straw is,

297
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,770
are these complete to feet?
It was only a matter of time.

298
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,510
The country was in a state of
emergency if there was no fuel.

299
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:21,750
So all the factories
were not working for you.

300
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:24,670
It was incredibly scas with
widespread starvation resulting.

301
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,330
The people were desperate and
they were furious in this climate.

302
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,410
A massive march on Rome took place
in March, again, still to Che,

303
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,210
bowing to the will of the people.

304
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,050
King Victor Emmanuel ordered Mussolini
to his palace where he informed him that

305
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:40,540
he was removing him from
office gods then came in,

306
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,270
arrested most Illini and
took him into custody venue.

307
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:47,260
Italian Prime Minister Pietro by Dalia
was intense on breaking the alliance with

308
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,920
Germany and signing an armistice
with the allies. However,

309
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,040
in order to stall for time, he kept up
the ruse of an alliance with Hitler.

310
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,790
Unsurprisingly,

311
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,090
when Hitler learns that the new ruler
had signed an armistice on September the

312
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:59,550
third in 1943 he was furious.

313
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,760
He ordered a full scale
invasion of his former ally.

314
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,990
Nazi forces used to blitzkrieg tactics
do you storm and capture room forcing the

315
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,820
king and it's prime
minister to flee the city.

316
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,580
Some elements of the Italian
army attempted to resist,

317
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,450
but many of them simply threw down
their arms and surrendered. Meanwhile,

318
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:18,510
muscly and he was being held at a
resort towns prison in the Alps.

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,550
He knew the situation was chaotic.

320
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,480
That was surprised to see German and
standing right outside of a cell window.

321
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,080
Video admins quickly overpowered the
gods and made their way into most of the

322
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,500
new cell. Why? One of
them said, elder chain,

323
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,330
the furor and to me to
set you free most of the,

324
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:35,640
and he was taken to hit list
East Prussia headquarters.

325
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,840
Hitler genuinely admired my and considered
him a great influence on his own

326
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:40,410
career,

327
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,860
but he was disappointed to see the man
before him all of Mysoline his will to

328
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:48,330
continue the fascist struggle, a
deserted him. The fear was dumbfounded.

329
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,050
When was the lady asked if he could be
permitted to retire from public life?

330
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,640
Hello,
we'd have none of us.

331
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,640
If you installed Mussolini as the
puppet ruler of northern Italy,

332
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,940
which was now in the hands of
the Nazis for the next 18 months,

333
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:03,480
my Illini played this role and impotent
leader who ruled over a people who hated

334
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,760
him all the while he
was surrounded by arms,

335
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:09,780
Nazis and the approaching allies with
the writing well and truly on the wall.

336
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,100
Most selenium trying to
escape to Switzerland's on
April the 27th of 1945 just

337
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,510
short of the border,
he was intercepted by communists suit,

338
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:19,560
took him and his companions into custody.
The following day.

339
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,640
They decided to execute him along with
his long time mistress Clara Petacci.

340
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,560
After riddling the bodies with bullets,

341
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,280
the Communists drove them into Milan and
dumped them in the middle of the town

342
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,930
square for hours.
The citizens of Milan to accounts,

343
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:35,610
they're amnesty on the man who had led
them to disaster his body. It was spat on,

344
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,750
stoned,
beaten,

345
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,530
and finally strung up by the feet that
are the body of the ones who revered

346
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:43,110
leader was subjected to
the abuse of the Kraut.

347
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,410
His corpse was eventually
thrown into an unmarked grave.

348
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,150
