00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,450
Heinrich Muller was the man who ran the
most feared of all institutions in Nazi

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,030
Germany.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,340
The Gestapo never developed Nazi.

7
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:20,500
He brought an unquestioning adherence,

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:25,330
do orders and do cold
calculating efficiency to
create an atmosphere of terror,

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,430
suspicion and darkness.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,520
And then with the Nazi
regime crumbling around him,

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,320
you simply disappeared.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,930
What did he and this week's bond graphics,

13
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:38,710
we take a look at the life and the
disappearance of Heinrich Muller.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,790
I'd recommended was born to
Catholic parents in Munich,

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,410
Germany on April the 28th,

16
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,244
1900.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,760
He had a middle class upbringing with
his father serving as a rural police

18
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,370
officer.

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,210
I'm rick experienced a primary school
level education before going on to train

20
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:08,400
as an apprentice mechanic in the exciting
new field of aircraft engineering.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,460
Seventeen year olds Miller join
the German army in June 19,

22

17 and in the 17 months that were to
remain if the first world war one both

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,600
promotion and to claim in April 19,

24
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:18,900
18,

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,400
he was assigned to the flag.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,510
I was building up to 287 where he flew
planes in an artillery spotting unit in

27
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,060
August,

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,421
19,

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:27,860
18.

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,160
Louis was promoted to NCO.

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,730
He was awarded the Iron Cross first
and second class while serving on the

32
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:36,090
western front after sustaining a
leg injury in a plane accident.

33
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:40,440
He was awarded the retired Bavarians
badge is mental whole during his short

34
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,221
period of service.

35
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:44,910
Also included the Bavarian military
cross second class with swords.

36
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,400
It was quite an accomplishment
for an 18 year old

37
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,000
after leaving the German army,

38
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,480
Miller founds employment as a junior
assistant for the Munich police force.

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,800
After a period of time,

40
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,040
he passed his entrance exam to
become a police officer by now.

41
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,250
He had reached his full height at five
foot seven inches tall and he had a

42
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,450
strong athletic builds and Willa kept
his dark brown hair cropped very short on

43
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:11,140
the sides.

44
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,750
He had a small mouth and
was rarely seemed to smile.

45
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,430
While his extremely intense day,

46
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,980
I would often a nerve
those in his company.

47
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,990
The first world war injury voted ended.

48
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:20,340
His war,

49
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,070
Korea caused him to walk
with a constant level.

50
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,440
Will have married a girl named Sophie
Dictionary in Nineteen Twenty Four.

51
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,800
Sophie's father was the publisher
of a right wing newspaper room,

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,360
was opposed to the new National Socialist
Party and its leader at of Hitler.

53
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,820
Mila was to stick to his
faith throughout his career,

54
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:40,930
despite the Nazi parties antipathy
towards the church three years into the

55
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:41,261
marriage,

56
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,700
his son reinhard was born.

57
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,090
The marriage was to last for some
30 years with the second child,

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,140
girl named Elizabeth.

59
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,400
Born on September the ninth,

60
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,510
1936.

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,270
The child was said to be not quite right,

62
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,250
which led to a strain in the marriage.

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,610
Subsequently engaged in an affair
with his private secretary,

64
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,010
Barbara Hellmouth and the marriage.

65
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,010
It was essentially over
over a 10 year period,

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,240
mother rose in the ranks to become
police secretary in 1929 by now.

67
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,570
He was serving in the section
six of the Bavarian state police.

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,100
This unit was mainly concerned with
seeking out and keeping a lid on communist

69
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,440
activity in and around Munich.

70
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,930
By the time he had reached the age of 30,

71
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,420
Mila had to become a rabid anticommunist.

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:22,841
Thanks.

73
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:26,680
In part to his having been a witness
to communist hostage murders during the

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,330
Bavarian state republic during the
German revolution of 1918 to 1919,

75
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,020
his energetic performance of his duties
and willingness to follow orders without

76
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,970
question earmarked him as a man with
a future in the new Germany during his

77
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,810
service with the Bavarian state police
mother ran in circles that included Nazi

78
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,261
leaders,

79
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:44,711
Reinhardt,

80
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,191
Heidrick,

81
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,480
and Heinrich Himmler.

82
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,060
However,

83
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,550
this time mullah no doubt
under the influence of his
father in law was decidedly

84
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:55,690
anti Nazi when the Nazis overthrew the
Bavarian government on March the ninth,

85
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,021
19,

86
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,760
33.

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:56,930
Well,

88
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,240
it was in favor of picking up arms
to actively resist hitless forces

89
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,620
with the barrier and its police force
under the control of the Nazis will

90
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,120
approved to be a valuable
asset for the new regime.

91
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,930
Has Knowledge of communist activities,

92
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:19,400
but in high demands and t advanced in
rank to become a criminal investigator.

93
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,200
In November of 1933,

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,430
he was a bit of a workaholic and exhibited
a high degree of self discipline and

95
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,264
ruthlessness.

96
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,240
His early experiences in the army had
instilled in him they military compliance

97
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,890
to orders that was highly
appreciated by the Nazi leaders,

98
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,720
is natural antipathy towards the Nazi
party capital from becoming a member until

99
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,700
he was compelled to do so in 1930,

100
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,840
nine years earlier,

101
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:44,690
referred to Hitler as an immigrant
unemployed house painter.

102
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,960
As a result of his
auntie nancy sentiments.

103
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,590
He was kept under constant surveillance
by the party in 1937 report referred to

104
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,591
him as ruthless and continually tries
to demonstrate his efficiency but claims

105
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,160
all the glory for himself.

106
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,880
However,

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,420
the truth of the Iraqi security
office Reinhardt Heidrick,

108
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,480
so a lack of blind
devotion to the Nazi party.

109
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,100
There's an asset he was increasingly
impressed by Mala having kept a close eye

110
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,170
on his police career in mullet.

111
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,000
He saw a man who was completely
focused on the minute detail of his job

112
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,880
description without a concern
for the bigger picture.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,490
From 1933 onward,

114
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,220
began doing work for the Nazi party
under the direction of Heidrick.

115
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,050
He would be given accounts and reports
detailing Nazi atrocities and turns them

116
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:32,060
into dry administrative reports.

117
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,200
In 1934,

118
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,260
he joined the secret service or the SS
in 1933 when Hitler became chancellor of

119
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,110
Germany,

120
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,020
Hermann goring,

121
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,720
Hitler's second in command became
interior minister of Russia.

122
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,120
This button in commands of the
largest police force in Germany.

123
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,980
Guerin created the Gestapo by amalgamating
the various branches of the Prussian

124
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:52,820
police forces.

125
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,110
The name was an
abbreviation of gooey Hina,

126
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,920
starts Palencia or secret police.

127
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,060
On April the 20th,

128
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,451
19,

129
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,800
34 SS leader,

130
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,530
Heinrich Himmler became
head of the Gestapo.

131
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,550
On that same day,

132
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Hitler appointed him chief of police for
all states apart from Prussia two days

133
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:14,140
days up him that handed the leadership
of the Gestapo to Reinhardt Heidrick,

134
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,850
who still retained his
position as head of the SS.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,020
On June the 17th,

136
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:22,220
1936 hipper appointed him as
chief of old German police,

137
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,660
including those in Prussia.

138
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,490
This movie gave him low operational
control over all of Germany's detective

139
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,300
forces.

140
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,300
The Gestapo had now become a national
agency as opposed to simply a Prussian

141
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,480
state agency.

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,470
Endless even created the criminal
police or criminal police,

143
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,760
merging it with the Gestapo to
form the CFO or secret police,

144
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,170
heidrick retains control,

145
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,010
making Heinrich Muller and his
operational chief in the wake of Hipaa.

146
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,110
Nineteen 38 onslaughts of Austria.

147
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,280
Mila was also made inspector of
security police for Australia.

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,420
It was Miller who gave the orders that
resulted in the arrest of up to 30,000

149
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,780
Jews on the night of November
the ninth to the 10th,

150
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,830
1938,

151
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,950
a date that history remembers as the
Kristallnacht or the night of broken glass

152
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,980
as a subordinate of Heidrick.

153
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:22,380
He also did most of the administrative
work in preparing for the immigration of

154
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:26,940
all Jews from Europe under the auspices
of the central office for Jewish

155
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:27,774
emigration.

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,390
Three years later on September the 27th,

157
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:30,841
19,

158
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:31,560
39,

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,370
the security and police agencies all
over the country were brought together to

160
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,830
form the right name,

161
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,630
security office or R,

162
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,640
m s a,

163
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,910
which was under the control of Heidrick.

164
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,210
The Gestapo was now officially
department for of the RMS RMSC,

165
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,153
heinrich muller.

166
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,600
He was named the Gestapo chief will
have finally joined the Nazi party in

167
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:55,500
November of 1939 after being
pressured to do you say by Heidrick.

168
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,120
From this time onward,

169
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,920
he became known as Gestapo Miller to
differentiate him from another Nazi

170
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,630
official who bowl the same name.

171
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,080
On August the 11th,

172
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:11,561
19,

173
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,160
39.

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,670
Adult fitness stated the following to
the League of Nations High Commissioner.

175
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,340
If that is the slightest provocation,

176
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,780
I will shatter Poland without warning and
just so many pieces that there will be

177
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:24,400
nothing left to pick up.

178
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,301
What he needed.

179
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:30,160
Next was that provocation which will
allow him to unleashes war machine and set

180
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,280
the world on the road to war to create it.

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,480
He turned to the Gestapo as a result,

182
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,390
heidrick and works together to bring
about the Polish provocation that Hitler

183
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,224
had warned about.

184
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,240
The plot to create the reuse of a
Polish propagation was called Operation

185
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,510
Tannenberg.

186
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,770
They decided to create a series of fake
border attacks in which Germans living

187
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:55,680
on the Polish border would be the
victims of attacks by Polish insurgents

188
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,311
literate.

189
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,730
Heidrick settled on the border
area near the town of Grievance.

190
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,181
Yeah.

191
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:00,440
Well,

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,111
situated,

193
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:04,830
isolated German outposts that would
make logical targets for attack.

194
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,820
It was decided that fake attacks
would be made on a forestry station,

195
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,990
a customs house,

196
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,400
and a radio station.

197
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,930
SS soldiers were recruited into the scheme
and dressed as petition surgeons and

198
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,820
as Polish army personnel.

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,060
More SS troops were then
clad in German army uniforms.

200
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,720
A last minute touched to the plan was
that some of the polls would be killed in

201
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,110
the attack so that their bodies
can be presented to the welds.

202
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,440
Media concentration camp
inmates were brought into play.

203
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,650
The part of these poles who were about
to be put to death operation Tannenberg

204
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,330
was stationed to go into action
at 4:30 AM on August the 26th.

205
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,770
Then we're to be three successive
code words and the various units.

206
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,000
Where do you cross the border?

207
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,530
Once the last code word was issued after
the release of the second code word,

208
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,920
some units became confused and
headed for the border prematurely,

209
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,990
but then he changed his mind.

210
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,670
The attack would be delayed.

211
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,870
Mental motorbikes were sent out to
bring back the attacking fake polls.

212
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,240
Hitler held back because
of British guarantees.

213
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:03,960
Deponent,

214
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,110
after consultation with Heidrick and Mila,

215
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,820
it was decided that the
plan would be revised.

216
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,720
It was also felt that a real Polish
insurgent would be needed so that he could

217
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,300
be put to death and paraded
to the world's newspapers,

218
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,040
Melissa,

219
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,640
through his files and came up with
the name of Franz [inaudible],

220
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,260
who was a prominent Polish
sympathizer on August the 30th,

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,671
Melissa,

222
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,540
and his men to pick up on the Iraq.

223
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,030
The attacks were carried out
on the evening of August,

224
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:29,400
the 31st starting at 8:00 PM.

225
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,061
A drug,

226
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:30,421
friends,

227
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,170
honey alk was dragged out and propped
up against the radio station entrance.

228
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,520
It was then shot in the head.

229
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,460
Photos were taken and delivered
back to mother and Heidrick,

230
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,690
but they were deemed as not being good
enough to be used for media propaganda

231
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,524
purposes.

232
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,010
Still,

233
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,990
the fake attacks serve that purpose.

234
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,860
The following day,

235
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,000
September the first 19,

236
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:52,740
39 adult Hitler referred to
them as justification for
his attack on the Poland.

237
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,783
Two days later,

238
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,810
Britain and France declared war on
Germany and the Second World War was

239
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:58,644
underway.

240
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,830
Heinrich Muller was now in charge of
the most ruthless arm of the Nazi party.

241
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,150
His brief was to stamp out all manner of
oppression to the regime he immediately

242
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:15,250
set about in his methodically
efficient manner,

243
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,340
so you create an instrument
of state sponsored terror.

244
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,030
The Gestapo were given the job of
investigating every act of treason,

245
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,103
espionage,

246
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,880
and sabotage perpetrated against the
state law that had been passed in 1936,

247
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:31,030
gave them free reign to
operate without any restraints.

248
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,350
This law gave the organization
exemption from any responsibility to the

249
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:39,520
administrative courts so long as the
Gestapo were acting in harmony with the

250
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:42,640
will of the Nazi leadership than
they weren't acting lawfully.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,350
The aspects of the Gestapo is activities
that was most open to abuse was called

252
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,430
the soft,

253
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,980
which translates to protective custody.

254
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,820
It gave them the authority to imprison
anyone without having gone through any

255
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,140
court proceedings.

256
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,950
As a result,

257
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,600
thousands of people were beaten
mercilessly with many of them simply

258
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,673
disappearing.

259
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,610
This gave the Gestapo a fearsome
reputation throughout the labs.

260
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,660
Fear in fact became the
gestapos greatest weapon.

261
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,960
Mila was a highly skilled
interrogated himself.

262
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,220
He would draw interrogations out for
hours on end is making full use of his

263
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,890
incredible memory to trip up his subjects.

264
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,690
We only have one surviving accounts
of an interrogation conducted by Moda,

265
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
his opening words to his subjects,

266
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,180
a British officer where you are
in the hands of the Gestapo.

267
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,070
Don't imagine that we shall show you the
slightest consideration with the onset

268
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:36,401
of war.

269
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:40,300
The Gestapo numbers web
bolstered substantially by 1942.

270
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,800
Mother was in charge of around
46,000 offices as German conquest.

271
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:49,030
It's mounted the operations of the
Gestapo extended to occupied territories.

272
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,480
Its duties were extended to
putting down resistance movements.

273
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,860
To do this effectively with only 46,000
men will have cultivated the perception

274
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:00,340
among the population that the
state was constantly watching,

275
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,990
that nobody was safe.

276
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,360
The miss sight of like a staff,

277
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:05,890
a unit would instill terror in people.

278
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,490
The general feeling was that if you
did anything against the Nazi stage,

279
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,071
the Gestapo,

280
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:13,930
they would eventually track you down and
then your life simply wouldn't be worth

281
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:14,680
living.

282
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,970
In order to cultivate the fear that
was needed to control the people,

283
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,810
I was happy to leak the details of the
sorts of torture that his underlings were

284
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,270
inflicting upon those taken into custody.

285
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,800
The more gruesome the story,

286
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,143
the better.

287
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,380
He also organized for the occasional show
trials to be held in public where the

288
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,120
People's court would vehemently denounced,

289
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:34,870
convict,

290
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,270
and then condemn a prisoner
to the firing squad.

291
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,620
Mother's favorite people's got judge
was the notorious redlands fries.

292
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,910
They're the custodian,

293
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:45,700
had offices at every concentration camp.

294
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,290
Personnel from the Gestapo were also used
to make up the Einsatzgruppen or death

295
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:50,680
squad.

296
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,330
Suit carried out mass killings.

297
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,330
The Gestapo were largely responsible
for putting into action hitless plan for

298
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,550
the elimination of the
Jewish people from Europe.

299
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,690
To accomplish this,

300
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:10,620
the office of resettlement native to
become the office of Jewish affairs was

301
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:11,430
created.

302
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,450
It was headed by adult Eichmann who
was Miller's immediate subordinate.

303
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,550
Together the two men implemented a mass,

304
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:22,410
deportation and exterminations that Nazi
concentration camps throughout occupied

305
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:22,980
Europe.

306
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,060
On march the second 19,

307
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:29,061
44 signs the infamous bullets decree which
ordered that escaped allied prisoners

308
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:33,420
were to be transported to the meth
house in Goossen concentration camp and

309
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:34,560
summarily executed.

310
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,700
This was in direct contravention of the
Geneva Convention in the wake of the

311
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,001
July,

312
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:39,571
the 20th,

313
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,520
1944 plot to kill Hitler.

314
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,140
It was Miller who authorized the use of
torture to interrogate those involved in

315
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:50,400
fact his zeal in the aftermath of the
attack and in the knight's cross to the

316
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:53,390
war service with swords
under his oversight,

317
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,440
more than 7,000 people were arrested
with 4,980 either committing suicide or

318
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,350
being executed.

319
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,650
Mullins duties included overseeing counter
espionage operations between 1942 and

320
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,680
1945.

321
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,780
These were focused on the Soviet Union.

322
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,640
Much success was achieved in feeding
false information to the Russians and even

323
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,980
in turning a number of Soviet agents.

324
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,700
Well,

325
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,340
it may have never been
a dyed in the wool Nazi,

326
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,370
but he believed the German
victory was inevitable.

327
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,080
Even in the last days.

328
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:34,280
He thought that a final German victory
in the den could turn the tide of the war

329
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,810
as the Russians and the Americans
closed in on Berlin in April of 1945.

330
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,790
Below was among those secrets
in the underground bunker
that was now home to the

331
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,080
rep in the final days to discover that
Hermann goring had secretly undertaken

332
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,280
peace negotiation with the allies
enraged the Phyrra ordered Miller to

333
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,390
interrogate Waffen ss
general an about what?

334
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,500
A new of gatherings,

335
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,610
underhanded dealings.

336
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,630
This interrogation,

337
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,660
his last official duty resulted in the
execution of felon on April the 30th

338
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:06,800
that'll fella and his wife Eva Braun,

339
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,510
committed suicide the next day.

340
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:08,751
May.

341
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:13,250
The first molar was quoted by Hitler's
personal pilot is saying we know are some

342
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,180
methods exactly.

343
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,680
I haven't the faintest intention of
being taken prisoner by the Russians that

344
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,700
evening have disappeared from the bunker.

345
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,470
Just happened to.

346
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,890
It remains one of the great
mysteries of the Nazi era.

347
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,450
For almost 70 years,

348
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,990
he remains the most senior Nazi
official to remain unaccounted.

349
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,863
Yeah.

350
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,640
On June the 18th,

351
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:38,510
1945,

352
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:42,530
the allied counter intelligence war rim
released a statement that concluded that

353
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:47,360
it seems clear from most reports that
molo remained in Berlin after the collapse

354
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,740
over the next few weeks,

355
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,590
several high ranking Gestapo
officers were arrested,

356
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:56,120
but the man at the head of the terror
organization was nowhere to be found with

357
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:58,310
Heinrich Muller being
a common German name.

358
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:01,430
The ally has found many molars
but never the right one.

359
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,700
This led to many false alerts
and frustrating dead ends,

360
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,370
so the United States counter intelligence
services were determined to keep

361
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,200
tracking down.

362
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,780
There were reports that he had taken on
the name of Schwartz or Schwartzer and

363
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,220
traveled south in the company
of a fellow Gestapo officer,

364
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,710
but this ended up as yet another dead end.

365
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,990
By the mid 19 forties,

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,240
the general consensus was
that Heinrich Muller had died.

367
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,890
The dramatic may 19,

368
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,630
60 capture of adults come in by.

369
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:37,010
The Israelis reawakened interest in
the search for the Nazis in general and

370
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,570
Heinrich Muller in particular.

371
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,523
I commit himself,

372
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,760
added to the interest by stating at his
trial that he was of the opinion that

373
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,950
Mona was still alive in July 19,

374
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:46,281
60.

375
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:51,000
The West German police were brought in
to open an into motos whereabouts it was

376
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:55,470
suspected that wherever he was little
I was corresponding with his family,

377
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,270
former secretary or mistress.

378
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,810
All of the things people were
therefore put under surveillance.

379
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,630
The West Germans developed
three major leads in the case,

380
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,800
each one confirming the belief that
he had met his end in Berlin in 1945.

381
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,790
This eventually led to the exclamation
of a grave in a cemetery in West Berlin

382
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,150
despite the fact that the
gravestone read our loving father,

383
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,220
Heinrich Mila born April the 28th,

384
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,090
1900,

385
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,960
died in Berlin,

386
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:19,531
may 19,

387
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,364
45.

388
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,890
The grave did not contain Mila's body.

389
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,550
The American CIA began to such familiar.

390
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,410
It's around the same time as
this west German investigation.

391
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,620
It was prompted by the defection of a
Polish intelligence officer who reveals

392
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:35,160
information about a
handful of escaped Nazis,

393
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,370
including the defects are informed,

394
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,670
the CIA that Miller had been taken into
custody by the Soviets and was working

395
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:42,504
in Moscow.

396
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,950
In counter intelligence,

397
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,420
the CIA attempted to corroborate the
Polish defect is inflammation with limited

398
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,140
success throughout the remainder of the
19 sixties that were various reports of

399
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:56,340
my love living in South American
countries such as Argentina or Chile.

400
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,560
Still no concrete needs emerge though.

401
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,161
Finally,

402
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,240
in 2013,

403
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,770
it appeared that conclusive evidence
that emerged proving that Heinrich Muller

404
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,633
did in fact,

405
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,670
Diane Berlin in 1945 research on the part
of the memorial for German resistance

406
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:15,540
concluded that he was buried in a mass
grave with around 2,400 other people in

407
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,140
Berlin.

408
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,920
The conclusion is based on a report of a
barrier commander which detailed to the

409
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:24,000
discovery of the body complete with Mona's
military identification papers in his

410
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:24,834
pocket,

411
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,650
so it would appear that the most
elusive of the Nazi hierarchy,

412
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,600
it's not simply the new of after role.

413
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,520
Just before we finished the video today,

414
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,700
I do want to say a particularly
big thank you to today's sponsor,

415
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,410
backblaze.

416
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,890
Now video is like this.

417
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,900
I personally feel that important,

418
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,580
but because of the way youtube works,

419
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:45,600
it's hard for them to be made because
of advertising restrictions on youtube

420
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,340
that you're probably familiar with.

421
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,410
If you're a regular watcher of well,

422
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:50,730
anything on youtube now,

423
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,421
this sponsor,

424
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,790
they also happen to
provide an amazing service,

425
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,810
so please do support them and support
us by checking out this great deal,

426
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,940
backblaze that a backup solution,

427
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,590
and it really is simply the best way to
backup any files that you have on your

428
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:04,980
computer.

429
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,270
As a video creator that I work with a
lot of data and I need that all to be

430
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,260
security backs up,

431
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,970
which I do with baclays.

432
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,421
In fact,

433
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,210
as I sit here,

434
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,700
my computer is over there singing
my files with backblaze servers,

435
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,301
security,

436
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,880
of course they use military
grade encryption now.

437
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,800
I've used backblaze for years.

438
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,150
They provide unlimited personal storage
for a low monthly fee and better yet

439
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,140
it's totally hands off.

440
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:32,460
When I put a file on my computer or save
a new document or do anything like that

441
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,240
back lace,

442
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,820
automatically it gets to
a mirroring that fall,

443
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:37,500
that video with their service.

444
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:42,240
Then if I ever have a computer failure
or my data gets destroyed somehow touch

445
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:42,720
wood,

446
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,230
I can just download it from backblaze
or more likely just to let them ship me

447
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:49,750
out a hard disk for a refundable
feet with all my files on it,

448
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,280
but if you're not sure this is for you,

449
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,460
then you can find out if it's for you
with the 15 day free trial that our users

452
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,931

453
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,460

456
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,611
Again,

457
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,031
as I said,

458
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,650
