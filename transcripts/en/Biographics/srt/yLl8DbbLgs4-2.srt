1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,520
He is the epitome of pure,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,990
unadulterated evil,

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,660
the mastermind gallery with the swastika
on his forehead and the wild crazed

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,540
look in his eyes.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,320
He is responsible for one of the
most heinous crimes of our time,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,050
controlling his minions like puppeteer.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,730
In this week's buying graphics.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,690
We're looking into the dark and
disturbing story of Charles Manson.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,220
Charles Mills Manson was born on November
the twelfth and Nineteen 34 to 16 year

10
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:41,221
old Kathleen Maddox and the 24 year old
tranzians labor known only as Colonel

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,190
Scott.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,480
Kathleen was a promiscuous teenager who
drank too much and earns money to fuel

13
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:48,460
their habits by selling her body.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,900
The baby was known as new name Maddix
for the first few weeks of life until his

15
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,460
mother seemed to settle on Shawnee.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,660
He never knew his father.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,390
He cleared out as soon as he
heard the Kathleen was pregnant.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,710
Kathleen was too young,

19
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,670
too immature,

20
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:04,240
and unpredictable to provide a
stable environment for a young child.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,780
She appeared to have new
maternal instincts and would
leave the trial to fend

22
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:10,450
for himself while she went
off on one of our vendors.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,350
As an adult.

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,520
Charlie often related to that his mother
was once in a cafe with him on her knee

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,070
when the waitress offered
to buy the baby from her.

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,810
Kathleen's asking price was a pitcher of
beer and having consumed as she simply

27
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:24,880
walked out and left Charlie to the women.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,931
According to Charlie,

29
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:29,500
his uncle took four days to track
him down and return him home.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,970
When Charlie was six years old,

31
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,520
his mother and uncle decided
to rob a gas station.

32
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,383
They were both caught,

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,930
convicted and sent for five years
to Moundsville state prison.

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,050
The boy was putting into the have
is strictly religious grandparents,

35
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:44,140
but after a few months he went to live
with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia.

36
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,930
The environment was very
different to anything.

37
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,730
Shawnee had previously known his aunt.

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,160
His sister was regimens in disciplines.

39
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,260
She was also strictly religious.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,310
Her husband's build was even more
fervent in his faith and his wife,

41
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,690
a strict disciplinarian.

42
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,880
He considered jolly to be a sissy.

43
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,930
On the first day of school,

44
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:05,680
he said the boy to class and address
in order to teach him how to fight.

45
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,190
Shawnee seemed adapt it to
this very different kind of
life and actually grew to

46
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:11,800
enjoy his new regimented
routine for two years,

47
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,230
between six and eight would prove to
be some of the most stable of his young

48
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:14,680
life,

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,220
but then his mother was released from
prison and immediately took him back.

50
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,080
Gasoline was more unstable than ever.

51
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:24,100
She preferred a life of promiscuity
and alcohol abuse to botanical,

52
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:24,970
domesticity,

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,480
constantly in trouble with the law
runs with no money for food and board.

54
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,830
They constantly moved around.

55
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,570
The Midwest or the age of nine.

56
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,040
Trolley dropped out of school.

57
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,300
The transient life that he was forced
to live shapes the type of boy that

58
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,140
Charlie would become.

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,230
He kept to himself living his
life through his imagination.

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,760
He was constantly watching,

61
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,320
taking things in and dreaming
of a future free of is no hope.

62
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,960
Mother,

63
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,950
he also learns how to become a very
accomplished thief is age nine.

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,470
Charlotte was caught stealing
and sent to reform school.

65
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,431
Three years later,

66
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:55,330
he was caught again.

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,890
This time he was off to the old school
for boys in Indiana before he was taken

68
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,101
away.

69
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:02,120
Kathleen promised to visit him often.

70
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,740
Of course they never did.

71
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:05,860
It's just 10 months
into his incarceration.

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,983
He escapes.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,770
He robbed a grocery
store to get some money,

74
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,790
and when that ran out,

75
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,980
he stole other things including a bicycle.

76
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,820
He got caught in the act of making off
with the bike and soon found himself back

77
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,654
in confinements.

78
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,390
This time he was sent to
Indiana juvenile center.

79
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,710
That's often just two days.

80
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
He stole some cutters,

81
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,450
freeze,

82
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,470
and not any himself.

83
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,150
That's 30 other boys.

84
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,710
This time,

85
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,350
the you on Phelan installed motorbike,

86
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,450
but rather a car,

87
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,140
but the 13 year old could hardly see over
the steering wheel and was apprehended

88
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,400
within hours of his escape.

89
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,990
When he ended up in juvenile court,

90
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,280
he was surprised to see his mother.

91
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,390
His spirits were dashed.

92
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:37,781
However,

93
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,620
when she testified that she would not
take him in the somewhat sympathetic judge

94
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,080
sent Charlie to Father
Flanagan's boys town,

95
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,160
but the state hip,

96
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,680
it was almost too short is
this last incarceration.

97
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,790
After just four days,

98
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,410
he ran off with another young offender,

99
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,280
Blackie Nelson.

100
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,300
They stole a car which they subsequently
crashed cell and they made their ways

101
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:55,991
in the hands of black,

102
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:56,461
his uncle,

103
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:59,110
a world war two veteran
and an underworld figure.

104
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,280
You gave the young hoodlums,

105
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,540
freeboard and food in exchange for the
proceeds from armed robberies that he

106
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,030
happened commit during that third robbery.

107
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,140
The two boys were caught.

108
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,250
This time at Shawnee was
sent to the Indiana School
for boys in Plainfield here.

109
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,900
He stayed for three years.

110
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,440
Charlie would laser claim that his
small statuette led him to be constantly

111
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,370
raped and sodomized by other inmates
as well as by the school employees.

112
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,270
They also recalls that he was constantly
picked on by the gods who would

113
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,910
continually find fault with him beating
him with leather straps and wooden

114
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,773
clubs.

115
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,510
One night after being gang raped
by her group of older boys,

116
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,460
he beat one of his attack as do just
short of the point of death with an iron

117
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:41,970
bar.

118
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,080
As the boy lay sleeping,

119
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,350
Charlie then place the bar under the
bed of one of the other attack is

120
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,540
successfully implicating
him in the attack.

121
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,350
Johnny was exhibiting a trait that would
characterize this personality as an

122
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,010
adult.

123
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,270
This was that he would hold his hand,

124
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:58,980
get in for a time only for it to
explode later in an orgy of violence.

125
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,230
Over the three years
he spent at Plainfield,

126
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,260
shawnee escaped no less than 18 times.

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,030
He was returned every time though,

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,500
and in March of 1951,

129
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,400
his sentence was increased and he was
sent to a minimum security institution.

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,200
This was the national training
school for boys in Washington DC.

131
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:15,930
Yeah.

132
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,870
Things were very different to what
Charlie had known at plainfield.

133
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,460
The facility was well run.

134
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,950
The boys were treated well
and it's a genuine focus,

135
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,840
was placed on rehabilitation.

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,070
Scholly liked that,

137
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,620
but he had no interest
in being rehabilitated.

138
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,603
He'll do his time,

139
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,570
but then it get back out to the life of
crime that he knew was waiting for him

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,920
at around the age of 15,

141
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:37,290
Charlene was given a
psychiatric assessments.

142
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,150
He was found to be aggressive,

143
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,073
antisocial,

144
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,190
and illiteracy.

145
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,300
The caseworker reported that the boy was
severely emotionally traumatized and in

146
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,550
serious need of psychiatric treatments.

147
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,210
It was also noted that he has a
higher than normal aptitude for music.

148
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,550
On October the 24th,

149
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:52,831
19,

150
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:53,260
51,

151
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,700
Charlie was transferred to the national
bridge on a camp in Petersburg,

152
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,380
Virginia,

153
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,250
three months later,

154
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,790
just weeks before his parole hearing
he sodomized and other inmates while

155
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,410
holding a razor blade to his neck.

156
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,880
He was reclassified as extremely dangerous
and transferred to a tough a high

157
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,050
security facility.

158
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,570
The federal reformatory at Petersburg,

159
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,320
Virginia.

160
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,760
After seven months of the
federal reformatory scholly
had racks up eight major

161
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,630
violations.

162
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,210
He was classified as defiantly homosexual,

163
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,140
dangerous,

164
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,860
and safe only under supervision
with assaultive tendencies.

165
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,360
Towards the end of 1952,

166
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,080
he was sent to a highest security
facility still that so the surprise of

167
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:30,710
everybody,

168
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,660
he transformed into a model prisoner.

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,380
He took lessons in reading and math and
began working in the vehicle maintenance

170
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:36,980
departments.

171
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,570
On January the first 1954,

172
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,500
he was given a merit service award
for his scholastic achievements.

173
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,110
His application to study,

174
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,270
sometimes a parent change of attitude
led to Charlie being paroled.

175
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,081
On May the eighth,

176
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:48,381
19,

177
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,040
54,

178
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,780
he was putting in the care
of his aunt and uncle,

179
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,890
but within a month of the now 19 year
old was back living with his mother

180
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,550
ourself.

181
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,810
Recently released from prison.

182
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,330
Six months after his release,

183
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,490
charlie married a waitress
by the name of Rosa Lee.

184
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,324
Gene Willis.

185
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,320
Shortly thereafter,

186
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,741
a son,

187
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,461
Charles Manson,

188
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:08,821
junior,

189
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:12,720
was born solely worked as a low income
job or augmenting his pay by stealing

190
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,380
cars.

191
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,900
They used one of those stone and
cars to me if his wife and baby,

192
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,800
so Los Angeles,

193
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,470
the car had been taken from ohioans.

194
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,220
Authorities were able to track it down.

195
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,390
Charlotte was charged with a federal
crime for taking the car across state

196
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:25,140
lines.

197
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,640
He was given five years probation,

198
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,710
but when he failed to show
up to a subsequent hearing,

199
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,050
he was arrested with
this probation revoked.

200
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,860
Charlie was sent for three years to the
prison on Terminal Island in San Pedro,

201
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:35,694
California.

202
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,870
After being there a few months,

203
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,450
he was informed that his wife
was living with another man.

204
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,373
Two years later,

205
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,510
she obtained a decree of divorce.

206
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,010
In September of 1958,

207
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,350
Charlie was released on
five years of parole.

208
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,070
He was now extending his criminal
earning potential by becoming a pimp.

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,590
He had a 16 year old girl working for him.

210
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,640
Over the next year,

211
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,270
he roamed around California and New
Mexico committing crimes and repeatedly

212
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,380
coming across the law.

213
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,670
In June of 1960,

214
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:03,480
he fled to taxes with a
California warrants out for
his arrest when one of his

215
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,580
girls was arrested for prostitution,

216
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,170
he was picked up and returned to Los
Angeles to face a 10 year sentence for

217
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:12,090
cashing a forged treasury check.

218
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,740
At the age of 26,

219
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,410
he was sent to the u s
penitentiary as Mcneil Island,

220
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,040
Washington.

221
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,210
While serving his sentence,

222
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,140
he learns to play.

223
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:19,710
The Guitar.

224
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,840
Ruins became interested in scientology.

225
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,030
During his time at Mcneil Island.

226
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,740
He also became obsessed with the Beatles.

227
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,700
Charlie has an inflated appreciation
of his own musical talents,

228
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:33,630
claiming that he would with the right
backing and training be even bigger than

229
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:34,380
the Beatles.

230
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,620
Shawnee became friends with an
inmate by the name of Alvin carpets.

231
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,000
This form of public enemy number one
was a former member of the infamous Ma

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Barker gang.

233
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,670
He taught charlie how to
play the steel guitar.

234
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,210
This further fueled his musical
obsession and did in 1966.

235
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:52,350
Charlie's prison record is that he spent
most of his free time writing songs,

236
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:57,351
accumulating 80 or 90 of them in a single
later commented on the Charlie that he

237
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:58,590
knew at that time.

238
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,280
He recalled that Manson was a
master manipulator of other people.

239
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,940
Prison authorities also noted that he
had a tremendous drive to call attention

240
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,774
to himself.

241
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,100
In June of 1966,

242
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,380
charlie was sent once
against terminal island.

243
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,340
This time in preparation for early
release when the day arrived on March the

244
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,720
21st 1967,

245
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,530
he had spent more than half
of his 32 years behind bars.

246
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,080
He requested that the
authorities let him stay in jail,

247
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,240
but he was told that he had to leave

248
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,960
and so it was that the five foot,

249
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,190
nothing drifted with the penetrating
stare and gift of the Gab wonders into the

250
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:40,191
height Ashbury district of San Francisco
with $35 in his pocket and no plans

251
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,980
except for a desire to make
it big in the music business.

252
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,940
Jolly moved into an apartment in Berkeley
and made money by panhandling before

253
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,780
long year your sins and every 23 year
old assistant librarian at uc Berkeley

254
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,980
named Mary Brunner,

255
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,470
he quickly one to rover and
moved into our apartments.

256
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,610
Bronto came into Charlie's spell and he
convinced her to widen out the higher.

257
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Within a few months they were
18 young women living with them.

258
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,740
Charlie introduced to Mary and the other
girls to drugs and before long married

259
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,430
quit her job and become a
devoted follower of Manson.

260
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,230
The family was beginning to take shape
with his female entourage and his guitar.

261
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,070
Charlie merged perfectly into the hippie
culture that was then in full bloom in

262
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:17,904
San Francisco.

263
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,550
He refined his role as a spiritual master.

264
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,110
A Guru as a prophet,

265
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,790
he used mind control techniques.

266
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,190
Do you get girls to do
whatever he wants it?

267
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,460
Most of the girls that gathered around
him came from troubled backgrounds and

268
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,160
suffered from insecurities
that left them directly,

269
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,960
opens at Charlie's manipulations,

270
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,440
as well as breaking down their
inhibitions with mind control techniques.

271
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,670
He used LSD and amphetamines to
control his ever expanding harm.

272
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,730
After about nine months living
in and around San Francisco,

273
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Charlie began to despair if the place
it had become to overrun with African

274
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:52,110
Americans and crime was rampant.

275
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,190
Of course that family were doing their
best to undo those crimes statistics.

276
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
They stole a credit cards
and used counterfeit money
to get what they need it.

277
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,550
They also stole a big yellow
bus and painted it black

278
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,850
johnny and just follow his traveling by
bus down the California coastline as far

279
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,020
as Mexico and taxes,

280
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,200
partying and committing
more crimes after 18 months,

281
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,130
so extended travel.

282
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:21,600
They finally settled in Topanga Canyon
near Los Angeles in a two story house.

283
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,170
It was here that shawnee began gathering
some male members to the family.

284
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,250
The first was a teenager named Bobby
Beausoleil who turned up one night for a

285
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,740
party and then stayed on
this Charlie's righthand man,

286
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,710
but we had been staying
with his music teacher,

287
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:34,441
Gary Hinman,

288
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,740
not far from the medicine Hyman,

289
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,730
but we recruited an 18
year old named Leslie van,

290
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,810
who teens or the family in June
of 1968 around land time scholly,

291
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:46,170
and some of the gals traveled to Los
Angeles where they mess up with a record

292
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,880
executive at universal studios,

293
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,550
former jail friends feel calvin
had arranged the meeting.

294
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,790
This was Charlie's entry into the rich
jet crowd and he turns on all of his

295
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,500
charms and make a good impression.

296
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,950
Seeing the family were rubbing shoulders
with the rich and famous at posh

297
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:04,450
parties in the Hollywood hills in the
late spring of 1968 beach boys drama.

298
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,260
Dennis Wilson was driving away from Malibu
beach when he happened to pick up two

299
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,980
hitchhikers.

300
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,830
The girls were parts of the Manson family
and they quickly agreed to go back to

301
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,850
his beverly hills home.

302
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,330
The three made love that afternoon and
Wilson left for a recording session

303
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,480
promising to return later to
take up where they left off.

304
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,390
When Wilson returned home in the
early hours of the following morning,

305
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,180
he was surprised to see that a
full scale party was underway.

306
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,050
He was greeted in the driveway by short
man with a scraggly beard who approached

307
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:29,350
him,

308
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,250
dropped to his knees,

309
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,720
and began kissing his feet.

310
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
The girls who Dennis had met earlier,

311
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,880
I came running out declaring this is the
guy and we've been telling you about.

312
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,460
This is Charlie inside his home,

313
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,220
Wilson founder.

314
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,080
12 more women,

315
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,720
most of them topless lying
around and smoking pot.

316
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Madison told him that the girls were
all there for Wilson's pleasure.

317
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,840
Wilson was impressed with the sway
that Charlie held over the women.

318
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,560
He welcomes the family with open arms
and this phone became the regular venue

319
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:54,170
for channel.

320
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,450
You orchestrated orgies.

321
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
Wilson Calls Manson the
wizard and began inviting.

322
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,370
Influential friends do come and meet him.

323
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,570
Dennis also allow Charlie to use anything
you wanted as a Ferrari or a Rolls

324
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,610
Royce and all the food and drink and
drugs that he or his group he's wanted.

325
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,560
Eventually Wilson's manager became fed
up with the influence and expense that

326
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:15,190
medicine was having on his clients and
Charlie and the girls were ordered out of

327
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,024
the mansion.

328
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,660
We're also spreading of the children of
the rich and famous being given drugs

329
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:20,530
and having sex.

330
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,750
I'm Chinese direction.

331
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,960
Suddenly the door to the Hollywood
elite lifestyle it would slam shut.

332
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,050
Charlie's planned for a music
career was also shut down.

333
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,801
This coolest,

334
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,660
a familiar buildup of jealousy,

335
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,111
anger,

336
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,740
and rage that would inevitably
find expression in violence.

337
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,000
Manson managed to convince the owner
of a former western movie set the spawn

338
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:44,200
ranch and Chatswood not far from Topanga
Canyon to allow the family to live in

339
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,160
the abandoned his property.

340
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,930
The family now moved to the ranch,

341
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:48,940
getting by by stealing and scavenging.

342
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,930
Johnny took to quoting.

343
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:53,260
The Bible is family members as they
gathered around a bonfire during the

344
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:53,860
evenings.

345
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,490
He also interpreted beatle songs
explaining that the lyrics were directed

346
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,324
towards them.

347
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,150
He was obsessed with
one song helter skelter,

348
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,110
telling his followers that the song
envisions and apocalypse brought on by a

349
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,330
race war of blacks killing whites.

350
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,580
The blacks would when he said,

351
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,380
but it would then sounds a
medicine to lead the new wells

352
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,011
for Charlie.

353
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:17,311
However,

354
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,080
the revolution was taking too long.

355
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,450
He wanted it to happen immediately.

356
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,590
He began preparing family members for a
series of actions that would precipitate

357
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,700
the black uprising.

358
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,120
The first step would be to release an
album of music that would contain subtle

359
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,610
messages that would commence
the black revolution.

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,500
On May the eighth,

361
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:33,811
19,

362
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:34,410

363
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,720
Terry Melcher reproduce them,

364
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,660
who had met Johnny through Dennis Wilson
arrived at spawn ranch to listen to

365
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,050
Charlie and the girl sing.

366
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,680
Melchert made promises but
never followed through on them.

367
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,910
On the 25th of July,

368
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:45,870
1969,

369
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,190
johnny older Bobby Beausoleil sale and
two women's at the home of Gary Hinzman,

370
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:54,260

with Manson had had that Hinzman had

371
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,870
inherited $20,000 and he wanted it.

372
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,610
Hinzman refused to hand over the money.

373
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,050
Shawnee was cooled and soon arrived off.

374
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:02,030
The screening is Shawn.

375
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,980
He pulled out a sword and cut off his ear.

376
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,000
Charlie then left with instructions
to get the money or kill the man.

377
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,961
After three days,

378
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,790
bobby stabbed his former teacher to death.

379
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,541
Before leaving,

380
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,240
he and the girls wrote the words
political piggy on the wall along with a

381
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,660
panther Polo in red to lay the blame
on the Black Panther movements.

382
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,930
Bobby Beausoleil was arrested
for murder on August the sixth,

383
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:21,231
19,

384
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,900
69 after being caught
driving around in Hinman's.

385
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:27,110
Car Manson was now ready to get
his revenge on Terry Melcher,

386
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,560
the record producer who had let him down
on the evening of the eighth of August.

387
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,390
He directed followers tax watson,

388
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,320

Susan Atkins,

390
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:37,940
and Patricia Cran winkle to the house
where he believed Melcher was living with

391
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:42,200
instructions to totally destroy
everyone in is making it as gruesome as

392
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:42,980
possible.

393
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,510
The house was located at one zero,

394
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:44,871
zero,

395
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,640
five zero clo drive,

396
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,380
but Melcher didn't live there anymore.

397
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,720
It was now occupied by a famous director,

398
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,640
Roman Polanski and his beautiful
eight month pregnant wife Sharon tate.

399
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,360
That night,

400
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,040
Polanski was in Europe on a film project
and his wife was entertaining guests at

401
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,280
the property hairdresser,

402
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,090
Jay sebring,

403
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,770
screen rice of Agora free,

404
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,120

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,610
Abigail,

406
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,110
Olga arriving at the
property around midnight.

407
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,570
What's inclined to telephone
pole near the Gazans?

408
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,433
Cut The phone line.

409
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,740
The car was then back to the bottom of
a hill that led to the house and the

410
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,860
murder team walked up to find the victims.

411
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,761
What's an thought?

412
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,210
The gates might be electrified,

413
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,290
so he ends the girls.

414
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,250
Climb Day brushing embankments and get
onto the grounds just then car headlights

415
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,310
came out from further up on the property
ordering the women's aligned lying down

416
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,091
in the bushes.

417
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,300
Watson approach the vehicle.

418
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:34,670
Lynn's leveled his 22 caliber rifle at
the driver that was 18 year old steven

419
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:38,600

a knife and then shot him four times in

420
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,260
the chest.

421
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,530
Watson then ordered Linda Kasabian
to keep watch down by the gate.

422
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,930
He and the other two women
made their way into the house.

423
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,530
The occupants were quickly gathered
together in the lounge when asked by for

424
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,600
Koski who they were once in replied,

425
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,690
I'm the devil and I'm here
to do the devil's work.

426
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,350
Watson then began to tie the heavily
pregnant Sharon tate and Jay sebring

427
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,950
together by their necks with rope
brought and slung over a beam.

428
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,851
Went sebring,

429
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,130
protested over the rough
handling of Sharon watts,

430
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:06,800
an shot him and then
stamped him seven times.

431
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,960
Meanwhile for Koski,

432
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,800
began struggling with Susan Atkins.

433
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,380
He repeatedly stabbed him
in the legs and torso,

434
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,780
still managed to get to the front door,

435
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,381
seeing this.

436
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:19,040
What's an rushed after him meeting up
with him on the porch and smashing his

437
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:19,871
head with gun,

438
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,430
but before shooting him
twice or they go off.

439
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,510
Olga had managed to
escape out onto the art.

440
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,610
She was chased by Patricia Van Winkle
who tackled her and then stabbed her to

441
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,270
death.

442
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,290
The only remaining victim was now Sharon
tate as she lay on the lounge room

443
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,010
floor with a wraparound and actually
begged to be able to live long enough to

444
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:37,844
have a child,

445
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,320
but a police were ignored and either
Watkins or Atkins stabbed her repeatedly,

446
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,730
including in the abdomen until both
she and her unborn baby would debt

447
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,400
remembering Manson's instructions
to leave a on the walls.

448
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,040
Atkins wrote the word
pig with Tate's blood.

449
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,533
The very next day,

450
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,100
the family struck again this time the
victims were Leno and Rosemary Lablanca

451
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,950
unhappy with the messiness of
the previous night's killings.

452
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:02,400
This time,

453
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,800
Charlie went with the group
to show them how it was done.

454
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,610
Different accounts have been given
about the exact happenings that night,

455
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,480
but we do know that Madison was in the
house and that he orchestrated the tying

456
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,314
up of the couple.

457
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,640
He then left with the orders that the
couple be killed before leaving the words

458
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:18,150
war.

459
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,720
Rise.

460
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,370
Death to pigs and helter skelter were
written with the blood of the victims on

461
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:25,440
the walls and the refrigerator door.

462
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,630
The murders caused a huge panic.

463
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,110
Hollywood's the pressure was now
on to solve the heinous crimes.

464
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,200
The police got nowhere until they finally
linked to the hinman merger to the

465
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,490
table of Blanca killings.

466
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,450
They knew that Bobby Beausoleil had
lived with a group of hippies that spawn

467
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:44,901
ranch,

468
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:46,910
so they decided to pay
the ranch and visits.

469
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,490
Bobby's girlfriend had told
police that Charlie Manson,

470
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:50,324
the hippy girl,

471
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,830
had ordered the killing of Henman.

472
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,280
Still,

473
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,160
there was no evidence linking
the group to the later murders.

474
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,001
Then in October,

475
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,511
24,

476
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,500
Manson and family members,

477
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,340
including Charlie,

478
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,190
were arrested on charges
of arson and grand thefts.

479
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,990
Susan Atkins was also taken into custody
and it was she who first began to spill

480
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:06,680
the beans.

481
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,080
She brags do a cellmate
about killing Sharon tate,

482
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,140
giving a detailed accounts
since implicating charlene
as the masterminds about.

483
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,851
At the same time,

484
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,700
police interviewed a member of the
straight Satan's motorcycle gang,

485
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:17,960
who was a madison acquaintance.

486
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,100
He told them the Manson had recently
been bragging about knocking off five

487
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:22,640
people.

488
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,610
The first piece of physical evidence
was the fingerprints of Patricia van

489
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:28,490
winkled that was found on
Sharon tate's bedroom door.

490
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,920
When other pieces of physical
evidence were recovered,

491
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,640
the police were ready to send the case
to court Manson and the four people who

492
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,330
had committed the tate labianca murders
were found guilty and sentenced to

493
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:38,900
death.

494
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,733
These penalties,

495
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,750
however it would never be imposed.

496
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,830
In 1972,

497
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:47,420
the California Supreme Court declared
the is death penalty law unconstitutional

498
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,780
Manson's death sentence was
commuted to life imprisonment.

499
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,270
Charles Manson died on November the 19th,

500
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,310
2017 of cardiac arrest,

501
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,050
having spent nearly 50 years behind
bars for his orchestrating of the crimes

502
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,510
that took the world in 1969.

503
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,180
He was 83 years of age,

504
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,980
so I really hope you enjoyed that video.

505
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:07,371
