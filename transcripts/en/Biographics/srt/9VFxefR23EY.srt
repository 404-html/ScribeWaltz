1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,050
Charles darwin,

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,250
the miles managed son of a physician
was once described as the most dangerous

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:06,084
man in England.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,660
In fact,

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,980
many people would consider them to be
the agents of the devil himself come to

6
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:12,390
sow seeds of corruption.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,310
Among the faithful is ideas struck
like a storm at the very foundation of

8
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,480
society turning conventional
religious thought on its hat.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:21,960
Yes.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,100
Just a few years earlier,

11
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:26,940
he had his sights set on becoming a
priest and devoting his life to God.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,160
In this week's biographics we investigate
the life and the ideas of Charles

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,173
Darwin.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,720
Charles Robert Darwin
was born in Shrewsbury,

15
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:48,721
England on February the 12th 1809 his
father Robert was a doctor and his mother

16
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,430
Susanna.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,390
It was the daughter of the
famous potteries owner,

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,200
Josiah Wedgwood jars.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,560
His grandfather was Erasmus Darwin,

20
00:00:56,561 --> 00:01:00,100
well known in his time as a
scientist with unusual ideas.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,310
He wrote on a range of subjects
including travel by air.

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,950
We're exploring by
submarine and evolution.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,580
Despite his learned father and
eminence grandfather Charles,

24
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,920
his early years were not outstanding.

25
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,420
He attended Shrewsbury School were the
main lessons where in the classics such

26
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:17,254
as Latin,

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,340
his school masters and his
father considered them to
be a boy of very ordinary

28
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:24,610
intelligence despite his
apparent lack of promise.

29
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,530
Charles showed a great
interest in learning boss
rather than studying Greek and

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,870
in like most of the students of the time,

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,340
he was taken with the English poetry
of William Wordsworth and Lord Byron.

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,810
When Charles was a teenager,

33
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,550
science began to captivate them so
much so in fact that he had his brother

34
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:47,500
Erasmus build a chemistry lab in a
garden shed in 1825 Charles attended

35
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,180
Edinburgh medical school in Scotland,

36
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,340
but he was not a good medical students.

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,770
He found the lectures dull.

38
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:56,710
Ma'Ams had to leave the operating theater
because he could not stand the horrors

39
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:57,544
of surgery.

40
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,940
One thing he did enjoy though
was the study of taxidermy,

41
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,930
which he learns from a format
African slave named John Edmondson.

42
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,850
During his second year in Scotland,

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,010
Darwin joins the Plinian Society,

44
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,420
a club for naturalists.

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,790
He was taken with that
intellectual debates,

46
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,390
which exposed him to ideas
of how man was created,

47
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,290
not buying guns,

48
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,540
but by gradual changes in form.

49
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,374
Over time,

50
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,510
these ideas had been espoused by Charles,

51
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,650
his own grandfather,

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,461
Erasmus,

53
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:29,120
Darwin,

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,020
while of the university,

55
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:30,741
Darwin Matters.

56
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,420
Ecologist named Robert Grants,

57
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,580
and the two became close friends.

58
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,420
Grant has been credited with being the
first person to interest Darwin in the

59
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,410
theory of evolution.

60
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,400
At this time,

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,540
Charles began collecting fossils
since learning more about animal life,

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,460
so the great disappointment of his father
Charles quit medical school in 1827 he

63
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,170
joined his uncle Josiah Wedgwood,

64
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:56,171
the second for a trip to Paris as see
vacations his father still fretting over

65
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:58,100
his son dropping out of medical school,

66
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,660
made plans for Charles to study
for the clergy enrolling him.

67
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,790
It's Christ's College
Cambridge University.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Despite the evolutionary ideas that had
been filling his mind's during his time

69
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,290
at Edinburgh,

70
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,230
Charles still held to
a belief in creation.

71
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,243
Later he rose.

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,070
I did not then in the least doubt,

73
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:17,800
these strict and literal truth
of every word in the Bible.

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,660
During the summer before
his studies began,

75
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,500
Charles fell in love with a girl by the
name of Fanny Oh in the sister of one of

76
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,250
his friends.

77
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,050
They spend long hours talking,

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,360
riding horses and playing cards.

79
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,070
Darwin's theological studies at Cambridge
began towards the end of 1827 but

80
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,440
rather than getting immersed in the Bible,

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,440
he developed a fondness
for collecting beetles.

82
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,150
He attended lectures on botany given
bunny the reverend John Stevens Henslow.

83
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,070
Darwin saw this as a possible career
path and he pursued his studies with

84
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,120
enthusiasm.

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,350
By ACR 29 it became clear that Darwin
had no interest in joining the clergy.

86
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,250
He spent that spring break with the
Reverend Frederick hope and noted

87
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,090
entomologist.

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,980
Here's obsession with
the study of Beatle Song,

89
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,260
no time for his budding
romance with fanny,

90
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,570
and they broke up that following spring.

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,170
Despite his general lack of
interest in his clerical studies,

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,070
Darwin past his finals exam in January,

93
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,740
1831 basing 10 fitness
class finished with school.

94
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:18,700
He was all set to become a countryside
clergy or the edge one with a deep

95
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:19,630
scientific interest,

96
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,890
but reverend Hansley who had become
something of a mentor to Charles suggested

97
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:28,300
that he should see some of the world's
before he settled down to his posting to

98
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,200
oh in decided to take a trip to the
Canary Islands off the coast of Spain.

99
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
He plans to go with his
friend's Momma do Ramsey.

100
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,440
They intended to study the
geological formations on the islands,

101
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,150
but before they could set sail,

102
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,170
Ramsey died.

103
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,340
Suddenly Darwin was stricken with grief
and could not travel to the islands.

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,510
A few weeks later he received a letter
from reverend Henslow informing him that

105
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,000
there was an opening on a
ship that may interest him.

106
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,230
The HMS Beagle,

107
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,030
which was bound for South America.

108
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,160
The bagel was being repaired as one of
several ships scheduled to map South

109
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:03,730
America.

110
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,481
Robert Fitzroy,

111
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,560
the captain of the Beagle,

112
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,000
recognize that the long
voyage would require for a
variety of men to be on board

113
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:10,840
for companionship.

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,950
He was keen to have a scholar gentlemen
who could help describe the areas that

115
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,150
were being charted as well as to
relieve the TDM between ports of call.

116
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,130
When the opening presented itself,

117
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,840
Darwin was keen to fill the spot.

118
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,350
However,

119
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,190
his father Roberts refused to give his
adult son permission to embark on a

120
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:27,850
voyage.

121
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,920
Robert's continued to
believe that Charles,

122
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:34,570
his interest in science was
merely a passing fad and
that the young man remained

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,260
adrift.

124
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,320
It was left to Charles,

125
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:40,570
his uncle Joe Cya to step in
and to persuade his brother
to give permission for

126
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,340
his son to join the expedition.

127
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,680
Charles then hastened to London's and
meet with caps in Fitzroy in the hope of

128
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,050
that the offer was still available.

129
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,260
He was in luck with plans
for a September departure,

130
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,570
gradually moved back the ship.

131
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,070
Finally set sail on Tuesday,

132
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:59,071
December the 27th 1831 Darwin
found himself in a small
cabin that was nine feet

133
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,540
by 11 feet long and only five feet high.

134
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,530
Part of his cabin was taken over by one
of the masts rising through it from the

135
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,010
start.

136
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,843
He was seasick.

137
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,090
A condition that remained
over the next five years.

138
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,770
On January the 16th 1830 do the big or
stopped at Cape Verde off the western

139
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,760
coast of Africa,

140
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,980
her Darwin founder band of fossil shells,

141
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,960
45 feet above sea level.

142
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,020
How he wondered the fossils rise so high.

143
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,460
After 23 days,

144
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,510
the crew was set out for Brazil arriving
in the port city of Salvador at the end

145
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,940
of February,

146
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,850
1832 are up to spring.

147
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,930
The big old traveled along the Brazilian
coast stopping in many ports at each

148
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,290
stop.

149
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,730
Darwin took long hikes.

150
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,960
Collecting many specimens he could likes
is a huge number of specimens which he

151
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,100
carefully catalogs and protected
on board Fitzroy and the crew.

152
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,390
They consider this work worthless and
is growing collection a load of junk,

153
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,410
but to trials,

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,630
they were precious scientific discoveries.

155
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,740
Every few months.

156
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:58,940
He arranged for a shipments to be sent
back to reverend Henslow in Cambridge for

157
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,620
safekeeping from Brazil,

158
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,570
the Beagle at sales to Patagonia,

159
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,900
a large region of South
America that is now Argentina.

160
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,670
They're Darwin collected fossils,

161
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,660
bits of bone and feathers that
he had never before encountered.

162
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,660
He struggles to accurately record
their features in the hopes that more

163
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:18,980
experienced naturalists could later
help to identify them from Patagonia.

164
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,500
The Beagle went further
to Tierra del Fuego.

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,850
It was here that Darwin encountered native
people who still dwells in the jungle

166
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,760
and were considered to be
at savages by the Europeans.

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,230
By march of 1833 the crew of the Beagle
began mapping the Falkland Islands,

168
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,320
which the British had claimed from
Argentina actress months earlier,

169
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,730
fascinated by the burdens animal
fossils found that Darwin spent his time

170
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,630
comparing the specimens with everything
he had collected to date the work that

171
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,830
Darwin was immersed in.

172
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,180
It was becoming so exhaustive that he
recognized the need to take on a servant.

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,000
He wrote home to his father asking
for the money to hire someone.

174
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,500
When permission came back,

175
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,970
he asked the ships odd job,

176
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,270
man,

177
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,021
sims coverings,

178
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,280
and to take on the role.

179
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,971
Meanwhile,

180
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:02,270
the letters that Charles had been sending
back to reverend tens low were being

181
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:04,730
read aloud to the Philosophical
Society of Cambridge.

182
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,380
This owns Darwin and early reputation as
an excellent naturalist and observer on

183
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,790
Darwin's 25th birthday.

184
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,840
Captain Fitzroy names the highest
mountain in the Tierra del Fuego region

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,320
mounts.

186
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,240
Darwin in Charles is on that by 1834 the
ship had sailed round Cape Horn at the

187
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:24,260
southern tip of South America and
crossed from the Atlantic to the Pacific

188
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,470
Ocean.

189
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,101
During the summer,

190
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,420
Darwin became quite ill.

191
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,410
He was deemed too sick to continue the
voyage and spent four frustrating months

192
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,490
in Tierra del Fuego.

193
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,300
Recovering.

194
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,430
Historians believe that
he had chagas disease,

195
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,080
which is a form of sniffing sickness.

196
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,210
Though in returns of the
Beagle in November of 1834
the ship rounded Cape Horn

197
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,110
and sales up self,

198
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,190
America's west coast.

199
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,240
On February the 20th 1835 a great
earthquake shook the region and during the

200
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,680
boards of Concepcion in Chile,

201
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,110
Darwin saw the appalling damage.

202
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,980
He also noted that the rocks around the
harbor had been lifted almost a meter by

203
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:57,120
the earth's movements,

204
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
shellfish and seaweeds,

205
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,850
which were normally near the water.

206
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,290
We're now high and dry,

207
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,080
so could such catastrophic
changes in the surroundings.

208
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,680
The linked to changes in parts
and animals is what he wondered.

209
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,920
The Beagle now left South America and set
sail across the Pacific Ocean almost a

210
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,973
thousand kilometers from the mainland.

211
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,150
It angered does a group of about 13
small rocky islands on the equator.

212
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,790
These were of course
the Galapagos Islands.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,970
Darwin was immediately struck by
the strange nature of the birds,

214
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:28,230
reptiles and others that he found that
they seemed unique to these islands.

215
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,010
Yet they had many similarities to
species founds on these South American

216
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,610
mainland's stranger still each
island had its own kind of animal.

217
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,260
One example was the giant tortoises
winning more than 200 kilograms,

218
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
which the ship's crew
right around like horses.

219
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,840
The local people could tell which island
did tortoise came from by the shape of

220
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:46,674
its shell.

221
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,820
Darwin was especially intrigued
by one group of birds,

222
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,803
the finches,

223
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,790
they were mostly small and drab,

224
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,481
Brown in color,

225
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:58,590
but each species had a slightly different
size and shape of beak allowing it to

226
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:00,300
tackle a certain kind of food.

227
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,310
Darwin noted in his notebook,

228
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,110
one made really fancy that
from an original paucity of
birds in the archipelago,

229
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:11,130
one species had been taken and
modified for different ends.

230
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,690
The idea of evolution,

231
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,580
but it was beginning to take root.

232
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,660
The bagel sailed on across the Pacific
to Tahiti where Darwin fell in love with

233
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,560
the misty peaks,

234
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,460
tropical plants,

235
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:21,480
colorful animals,

236
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,540
and these simple natural
lifestyle of the local people.

237
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,140
The journey continued on towards
New Zealand and then Australia.

238
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,130
He was shocked at the terrible living
conditions of the local people and the own

239
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,611
lands.

240
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,640
They were ruled over and made
slaves by European settlers.

241
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,450
This seemed to support his observations
from the animal world that the stronger

242
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,140
always took over from the week.

243
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,073
Okay.

244
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,820
The Beagle returned to Fallon,

245
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,640
the thing balloons on the 2nd of October,

246
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,760
1836.

247
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,100
They had been away for five years.

248
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
Darwin's spend the next
few years organizing and
cataloging his vast collection

249
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:56,420
of plants,

250
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,990
animals,

251
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,530
rocks,

252
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,363
and fossils.

253
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,080
By the summer of 1838,

254
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,980
Darwin felt bold enough to share
his radical ideas with this father.

255
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,860
We took them in his straight
for the last several months.

256
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:09,420
Charles had struck up a close
relationship with his cousin,

257
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:10,254
Nema Wedgewood.

258
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,091
However,

259
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,610
when he brought up the
subject of marrying and uh,

260
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,850
his father warned that she
came from a very strict family,

261
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,260
Amma would never consider Darwin's
theories as anything but heresy deeply in

262
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:21,441
love.

263
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:25,070
Though Darwin ignored his father's
advice to curtail the romance.

264
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,580
He mentioned some of his notions
regarding religion in nature to Emma.

265
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,900
It was surprisingly understanding Darwin
juggled numerous tasks from writing

266
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:37,880
books to studying more fossils to watching
apes and hangs at the London Zoo as

267
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:38,300
he works.

268
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,250
He also continued his
relationship with Emma.

269
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,140
You proposed to her on November the 11th,

270
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,160
1838.

271
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
The proposal was well received
by both sides of family.

272
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,330
Arrangements were made for
Darwin to receive a handsome
annual sum of money from

273
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,164
his father.

274
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,540
This would allow the couple to live while
Darwin continued retaining Covington

275
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,230
services.

276
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,680
Since research on his theory of
evolution was still incomplete,

277
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,110
jaws and Emma were married
on January the 29th,

278
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,960
1839 the couple of settles
into her home in London,

279
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,120
which was already filled
with scientific material.

280
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,140
Shortly thereafter,

281
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,500
Covington left Darwin's employment
to make his own fortune.

282
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,440
He was replaced by a man
named Joseph Pass Layer.

283
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,530
During the spring of 1839
Darwin carried out research.

284
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,364
I'm crossbreeding.

285
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,630
He asked various experts,

286
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:23,080
including farmers questions about
how they crossbred their animals.

287
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,370
He filled page off the page
with his correspondences in May.

288
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:30,040
The multivolume collection he wrote
with Captain Fitzroy narrative of the

289
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,430
surveying voyages of the HMS Beagle
was finally released to the public.

290
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,620
This celebration of the beagles voyage,

291
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,090
it became a best seller.

292
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,320
Charles was now a respected scientist
and author and as a member of the royal

293
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,154
society

294
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,730
during the 1814 and 1850 stolen,

295
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,480
continued his research and writing.

296
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,660
In 1842 he wrote a geology book entitled
the structure and distribution of coral

297
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:59,270
reefs with two more geology books
following in the next few years.

298
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,253
As time went on,

299
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,880
his health began to fail.

300
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,610
He could only do a few
hours of work each day.

301
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,360
His illness,

302
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,410
it was never identifies,

303
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,290
but it could have been the after
effects of his tropical sickness.

304
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,910
While on his five year voyage.

305
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,900
Despite his illness,

306
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,250
he continued his research.

307
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,570
And so the idea of evolution,

308
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,350
he was becoming more and more convinced
that species we're not fixed and

309
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:19,184
immutable.

310
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,690
He had written a short version of his
ideas in 1842 but decided to collect every

311
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:27,860
scrap of information he could and write
a lengthy book with masses of evidence

312
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:28,760
for his theory.

313
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,870
For many years,

314
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,400
Darwin was reluctance to publish his
ideas on evolution by natural selection.

315
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,760
It's meant that animals and
plants evolved naturally.

316
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,460
He now believed that God
have not created them.

317
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,180
However,

318
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,500
most people at the time,

319
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:43,940
including many scientists,

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,220
still believed in the truth of the Bible.

321
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,420
He knew that speaking out against the
accepted teachings of the Bible was set

322
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,660
into a fence and cause a storm of protest.

323
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,540
Darwin may have never finished
his work on evolution,

324
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:05,100
but for a letter which arrived
at his home in Kent in June,

325
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,970
1885 from Malaysia,

326
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,890
it was from another English naturalist,

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,760
Alfred Wallace.

328
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,640
Wallace knew that Darwin
was interested in evolution.

329
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,700
So with his letter he sent
his summary of the theory.

330
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,870
Darwin was amazed.

331
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,040
All of the work he had so patiently
done over the last 20 years was neatly

332
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:24,540
described by Wallace as a scientific
meeting at the nae and society in London.

333
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,370
The works of both Wallace and Darwin
were read outs in July of 1858 after that

334
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:29,580
one,

335
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,150
it's agreed the Darwin who had gathered
far more evidence to support their joint

336
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:37,740
theory should carry on with the idea while
he stood aside to Olin did say weekly

337
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,060
finishing his great book.

338
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,940
It was published on the 24th of November,

339
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,970
1859 and it was called
the origin of species.

340
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,350
The publisher of Darwin's book,

341
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:50,790
John Mary Reddit's before printing it
and realized a great outcry would follow.

342
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,680
As a result,

343
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,860
he only printed 1,250 copies.

344
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,330
These sold out almost at once and a
second edition was quickly produced.

345
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,343
They've all,

346
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,520
they were indeed outraged.

347
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,810
Darwin one's denying the truth that was
in the Bible scientists and lined up to

348
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,880
have their say with
many criticizing Darwin.

349
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,050
One clergymen cools,

350
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:09,590
the quiet,

351
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,760
mild mannered Darwin,

352
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,280
the most dangerous man in England,

353
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,380
but others quickly recognized the good
signs in Darwin as ideas and to the vast

354
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,090
amount of evidence which supported them.

355
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,230
The biologist Thomas Huxley spoke for
him in England while professor of botany

356
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,400
at Harvard University,

357
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,530
a sick gray it.

358
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,280
It's great supporter in North America.

359
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,600
Darwin himself stayed in camps and
took little part in the arguments.

360
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,070
So now the question arises,

361
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:34,191
well,

362
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:37,760
what did Darwin actually
postulate in his famous book?

363
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,211
Well,

364
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:42,110
the origin of species by means of
natural selection or the preservation of

365
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:46,370
favored races in the struggle for
life is a long but very readable book.

366
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,850
It begins by looking at
variation under domestication,

367
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:50,750
including pigeons,

368
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,321
horses,

369
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,430
and garden flowers.

370
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,020
Then it covers variation in nature and
the problems of identifying a species.

371
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,830
It shows how the offspring of parents
are all similar but slightly different.

372
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,510
These slight differences might give an
individual a better chance of succeeding

373
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,680
and staying alive.

374
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,990
Laser chapters deal with animal instincts,

375
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:09,590
fossils,

376
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,880
and the geographical and manner of
animals and plants from mice to elephants.

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,360
Yet.

378
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,020
He never explains the
origin of any one species.

379
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,160
As I mentioned,

380
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,150
the origin of species,

381
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:24,950
sharks and angered many people including
Darwin own family to accept the theory

382
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:28,730
of evolution meant accepting that the
accounts in the Bible of creation of

383
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:31,220
animal and plant species
could not be true.

384
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,390
Many scientists,

385
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,090
they simply struggles to
believe in both gradually.

386
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,630
However,

387
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,070
the theory of evolution by
natural selection gained
grounds and most scientists

388
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,130
came to believe that
Darwin was right Darwin,

389
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,860
he did not retire after the
origin of species was published.

390
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,010
He kept up his studies and researchers
and carried on with his experiments and

391
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,170
nature observations.

392
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,430
In 1871 he published descent of man
then selection in relation to sex.

393
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,220
In this work,

394
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,540
he concluded that humans are not
the result of special creation,

395
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,450
but that they have evolved
along with other animals.

396
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,330
Their ancestors could indeed be
traced back far into prehistory.

397
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,420
In the 1870s Darwin's health improved
and in 1877 he was awarded a special

398
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,160
degree by Cambridge University.

399
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,400
He continued to write books
about insect eating plants,

400
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,900
how plants grow and move,

401
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,490
and how they encourage decay and enrich
the soil with Descente huge success as

402
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:22,731
well.

403
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,460
Darwin divided his time
between revising the two works.

404
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,180
In April of 1874 he completed
work on descents second edition.

405
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,300
This was the last time he wrote about
evolution between projects and illnesses.

406
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,450
Darwin continued to refine his work
a decade after its first publication.

407
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,670
The fifth edition of origin was released.

408
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,850
The sixth edition published in 1871 use
the word evolution for the first time

409
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,910
after a mild heart attack in December of
1881 Charles Darwin died several months

410
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,030
later,

411
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,710
peacefully at down house.

412
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,750
His home of Nettie 50 years.

413
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,220
He was 73 years old.

414
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,090
By this time,

415
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,050
the storm of protests over the origin
of species had died away and Darwin had

416
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:05,820
become a national figure and one of the
best known scientific names of all time.

417
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,990
It was laid to rest at Westminster Abbey
London next to the Great Isaac Newton.

418
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,720
The funeral was attended
by dozens of politicians,

419
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,380
inventors,

420
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,160
explorers,

421
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,881
scientists,

422
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:18,930
and artists along with members of the
scientific communities of many countries.

423
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,960
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.
