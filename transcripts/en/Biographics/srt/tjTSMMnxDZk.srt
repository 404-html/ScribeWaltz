1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,350
In 1937,

2
00:00:01,351 --> 00:00:06,090
Amelia earhart was one of the most
famous women on the planet for the last

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,120
decade.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,160
She had been up ending stereotypes,

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,330
smashing records,

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,590
and establishing herself
as an international role
model as she settled for her

7
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:15,540
greatest adventure around the world,

8
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,090
excursion the whole world was watching.

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,430
Then suddenly she was gone,

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,140
just disappeared.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,650
And this week's biographics,

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,850
we delve into the marvelous and the
mysterious life and the death of Amelia

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,053
earhart.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,670
Amelia earhart was born on July the 24th,

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,061
18,

16
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,530
97 in Atchison,

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,370
Kansas.

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,990
She was the older of two daughters.

19
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,231
Do you?

20
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,060
Edwin and amy with system
Muriel being two years younger.

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,090
Edward stands on.

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,600
It was a talented lawyer
who worked for the railways.

23
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,560
Is Korea,

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,260
was blighted by an addiction to alcohol.

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,690
Emilia was named after
her maternal grandmother,

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,620
Millie Otis,

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,101
Millie,

28
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:02,561
and Emilia.

29
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:03,394
His grandfather,

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,870
Alfred,

31
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,260
actually took the girl in and she lived
with them during the school year in

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,020
Atchison from the ages of three to 11.

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,010
During the holidays,

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,560
she went to live with our
parents in Kansas City.

35
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,051
I mean,

36
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,550
they were attended a private college
preparatory school until she was ready for

37
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,120
high school.

38
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,110
Becoming an avid reader.

39
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:23,400
Young Emilia spent many long hours
devouring books of every source,

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,590
even though she spent most
of the year away from him.

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,060
Emilia adored how witty and well educated
Father Edwin Woods entertained the

42
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:33,330
girls and their friends with western
thrillers complete with bandits,

43
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:33,841
Indians,

44
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,530
cowboys,

45
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,120
and other made up characters.

46
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,990
Emilia marveled over his command of
the English language and one letter he

47
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,190
addressed her as dear parallel pepitone,

48
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,730
and she rushed to find a
dictionary to discover the words,

49
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,260
meaning,

50
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,100
despite his brilliance as a wordsmith,

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,210
Edwin was not so lucky when it came to
financial matters as a railroad liar.

52
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,130
He never really applied himself,

53
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:56,550
preferring rather to spend his time
coming up with inventions that would make

54
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,360
his fortune.

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,230
In 1993,

56
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,200
he designed the device,

57
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:03,000
do hold signal flags on the ends
of trains full of enthusiasm.

58
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,150
He traveled to Washington DC to fill
his plans with the patterns office.

59
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,800
After too frustrating days,

60
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,480
he read back to Amelia's mother verse.

61
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,560
A man from Colorado had filed patents
on an identical hold a two years ago.

62
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,360
This news is a terrible blow because I
had been counseling on receiving several

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,340
hundred dollars from the
railroad for my flag holder.

64
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,480
We're still the money that Edwin had
been counting on was earmarked to pay the

65
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,060
family's property taxes in
order to pay the tax bill,

66
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,790
and he had to sell a collection
of valuable law books
that had been given to him

67
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,060
by his father in law judge.

68
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,730
The judge was furious that his son in law
had done these things and a year later

69
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:39,180
when Edwin took his wife and two girls
for a week long trip to the world's fair

70
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:39,990
in San Louis,

71
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,950
the judge considered the
trip and extravagant waste
of money and further proof

72
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,610
of headwinds,

73
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,780
spendthrift habits.

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,790
Despite our grandfathers reservations,

75
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,320
Emilia loved the trip.

76
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,170
Has she enthusiastically rushed with
sister around the 1500 buildings and 12

77
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,650
palaces old lit by these still
relatively new phenomenon of electricity.

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,100
Her autobiography,

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,140
the fun of it's published in 1932,

80
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,580
I mean pinpointed three important threads
that attracted her to aviation and

81
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,630
interested in mechanics.

82
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,050
The many railroad trip street took
with her father and her love of

83
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,160
experimentation with sports and
Games as a railroad claims agents,

84
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,640
Edwin was able to take his family on
trips all over the country that travels,

85
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,230
developed and Emilia a deep seated desire
to see more and more of the world at

86
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:23,920
large.

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,210
When Emilia wasn't traveling,

88
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,030
she spent hours sitting with our cousins,

89
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:31,780
knew c and Catherine Shalles looking over
maps of faraway places and dreaming of

90
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,970
overseas excursions from the beginning.

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,920
The future Aviatrix was a daredevil who
acted as if she was immune to danger.

92
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,590
She was attracted to every type of sport,

93
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,800
but she chafed under the
societal stereotypes of the day,

94
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,360
which limited gals to reading,

95
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,811
sewing,

96
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,500
and cooking.

97
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,160
She was lucky that she had parents who
encouraged her tastes for boys pursuits

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,600
and allowed her and her sister to dress
in dark blue flannel bloomers gathered

99
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,920
up at the knees for play rather than
the customer addresses and Pinafores at

100
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:00,280
school.

101
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,420
Emilia was known as Millie.

102
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,830
She earns good grades but
seem to be rather impatient
and she didn't worry about

103
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,450
the details of academic work.

104
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,330
She would quite easily solve
math problems in our head,

105
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,760
but couldn't be bothered
writing out her working.

106
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,590
This lack of attention to detail was a
trait that stayed with the media into

107
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,370
adulthood.

108
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,210
It was at the Iowa state fair in 19.

109
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:19,311
Oh,

110
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:19,541
seven.

111
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,670
The two media saw her first aeroplane.

112
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,170
She recalled it as a thing of rust and
why that didn't interest her soul and she

113
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,430
wasn't alone at the time.

114
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,540
Neither automobiles nor planes were
predicted to become a functional means of

115
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,374
transportation.

116
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,981
In Nineteen Oh,

117
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,190
eight,

118
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,110
Emilia stops living with our grandparents,

119
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,960
Naprosyn and moved with
our parents do des Moines,

120
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,740
Iowa,

121
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,150
that she entered public school.

122
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,500
She did well academically.

123
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,880
Despite our problems at home.

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,920
Our parents argued constantly,

125
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,150
mainly over money and the constant and
drove her beloved father to the bottle.

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,500
This was at a time when states across
America were increasingly becoming dry.

127
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,000
Public displays of drunkenness were a
source of great humiliation as a result of

128
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,940
the public inebriation
of Edwin stands in heart.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,710
Soon became the talk of the town,

130
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,760
the heavy drinking eventually led to
Edwin losing his job at the railway for

131
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:12,510
over a year.

132
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,740
He remains out of work.

133
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,110
Finally securing a menial clacking job.

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,750
It required that the family
moved to simple Minnesota.

135
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,870
The departure from Iowa was a
depressing one for the girls,

136
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,330
but especially for that
long suffering mother,

137
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,670
as they boarded the
railroad car doesn't pull.

138
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,440
She shed tears of frustration.

139
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,670
Life was tough.

140
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:32,040
Instant poll where the family
barely making ends meet.

141
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,800
Edwin's drinking was also
still not under control.

142
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,511
On one occasion,

143
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:38,640
the media found a bottle of whiskey and
her father's suitcase and proceeded to

144
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:42,150
empty it into the kitchen
sink and infuriated Edwin
and tried to slap the Gal,

145
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,530
but any stops him.

146
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,680
The constant moves that have family
undertook during her teen years.

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,100
Left Emilia feeling rootless and insecure,

148
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,380
but rather than discussing her problems,

149
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:55,350
she instead focused on her ambitions.

150
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,790
The family only stayed in support for
year with the job awaiting Edwin and the

151
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,680
claims office of the Burlington railway,

152
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,450
they relocated to Springfield,

153
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,170
Missouri.

154
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,003
The move though,

155
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,060
it was a disaster.

156
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,590
After a seven hour train journey,

157
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,860
the family discovered that the job
had already been taken for amy.

158
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,540
This was the final Straw.

159
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,710
She demanded a trial separation and took
the two girls to Chicago to stay with

160
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,570
old family friends in Chicago.

161
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,290
Emilia shouldered responsibility for
her mother and sister as head of the

162
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:21,980
household.

163
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,410
Her behavior and terror
appearance changed dramatically,

164
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,330
although usually attended Hyde Park,

165
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,040
the best public high school in Chicago.

166
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,340
She did not participate in any of the
numerous clubs that the school offered,

167
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,770
nor did she play any of the
sports that she so loved.

168
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,780
She now referred to herself as a.

169
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,330
He was isolated herself
from her fellow students.

170
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,210
She refused to attend the senior banquet,

171
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,330
some graduation ceremony,

172
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,010
a senior yearbook photo caption,

173
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:47,300
read the girl in Brown who
walks alone by the fall of 1915.

174
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,430
Though things have improved
in their heart marriage,

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,260
Edwin had stopped drinking and the family
had reunited in Kansas City for the

176
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,330
next year.

177
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,700
Emilia did not attend school,

178
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,840
but spends her time acting as a buffer
between her parents and hoping to

179
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:00,890
preserve the marriage.

180
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,550
The family fortunes took an immediate
turn when any received an inheritance.

181
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,880
She used some of the funds to send Emilia
to the Oregon is finishing school on

182
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,320
the outskirts of Philadelphia.

183
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,920
It was there that Emilia polished her
social graces which would allow her to

184
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:17,600
move with ease and poise
among all segments of society
after she became famous

185
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,740
at the age of 19.

186
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,710
She was the oldest of the students at
the finishing school when she entered in

187
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,060
the fall of 1916.

188
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,940
While she was there,

189
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,180
Amelia's feminist
proclivities came to the fore.

190
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,780
She gets a newspaper clipping file,

191
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,700
have accomplished women,

192
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,470
many of them firsts in their fields,

193
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,450
but she was no suffragettes.

194
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,380
Next one clipping.

195
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,010
She wrote,

196
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,210
women will gain economic
justice by proving themselves
in all lines of endeavor,

197
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,580
not by having laws passed for them.

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,020
Over the first semester,

199
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:42,710
Christmas break,

200
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,730
Emilia returned home.

201
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,690
While that she witnessed the ravages of
the first world war returned soldiers on

202
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,560
the street with missing limbs or had been
blinders or had been otherwise names.

203
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,150
She returned to the finishing school,

204
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,470
but she felt conflicted.

205
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,580
She wrote to her mother,

206
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,990
I can't bear the thought of going
back to school and being so useless.

207
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,490
Emilia decided to quit the school and
enrolled in a course to join a voluntary

208
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,420
aid detachments,

209
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,000
a group of civilians who
served as assistant nurses,

210
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,170
ambulance drivers,

211
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,370
and regular nurses.

212
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,750
After several months of training,

213
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,650
sister Amelia,

214
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:13,484
as she was known,

215
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,380
was posted to Spadina military hospital
on the campus of the University of

216
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,650
Toronto,

217
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,890
working there until just
before the armistice in 1918.

218
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,820
She cared for soldiers who
had been poisoned by gas
and otherwise injured in the

219
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,350
trenches of the western front.

220
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,810
She also looks after pilots
from the Royal Flying Corps,

221
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,350
Canada,

222
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,400
who had crashed in Europe.

223
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,600
It was while tending to these injured
pilots that Emilia became fascinated with

224
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,010
the idea of flying.

225
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,790
The men would trade stories about their
exploits high above the ground nearby.

226
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,570
It was the Royal Flying Corps base and
the skies were filled with hundreds of

227
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:44,991
planes.

228
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,824
Buzzing rounds.

229
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,020
Civilians were not allowed
to fly in the planes,

230
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,010
but on their days off,

231
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,280
Emilia spent time with the pilots
and attended area exhibitions.

232
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,330
Now the hospital job,

233
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,400
it was intensely demanding with Emilia,

234
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,090
often working 12 hour shifts.

235
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,910
She became so worn down
this in the summer of 1918.

236
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,690
She came down with influenza and pneumonia
and developed painful scientists,

237
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,350
scientists.

238
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,280
As a result of this,

239
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,400
she suffered from chronic sinus
infections for the rest of her life.

240
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,800
After a period of
convalescence with our mother,

241
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,160
immediately enrolled at Columbia
University studying zoology,

242
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,910
biology,

243
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,690
and chemistry.

244
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,140
She rented a modest apartment in New
York City at the end of the spring term,

245
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,460
though she quit her studies,

246
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,940
she would like to claim that she had
simply decided against a medical career.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
The reality was that she
lacks the temperament to wade
through years of tertiary

248
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:31,530
study spending the next year
with our parents in Los Angeles.

249
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,670
Amenia put her focus on helping them keep
their marriage and tax over the course

250
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:36,250
of that year,

251
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,670
but now 22 year old Emilia,

252
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,270
we'll take our first paying job,

253
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,680
drive a fast car,

254
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,470
and fly a first plane.

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,300
Los Angeles in 1920
was a haven for pilots.

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,920
It was full of barnstormers pilots who
stunted in asset classes and gave rides.

257
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:57,840
Do often terrified passengers.

258
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,920
In December of Nineteen
Twenty Emilia ends,

259
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,600
her father went to an Air Rodeo in
long beach where pilots performed,

260
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:08,601
spins and dives amid a crowd of spectators
the next day and wouldn't pay $10 to

261
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,980
give his daughter our
first passenger flights,

262
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,940
a 10 minute ride over the Hollywood hills
the moment the plane left the grounds

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
she knew that she herself has to fly.

264
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,470
It was at that moment,

265
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,620
but she knew she had found her
calling without telling her parents,

266
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,040
Emilia signed up for flying lessons with
the expectation that Edwin would cover

267
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,230
the $500 feet,

268
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,740
but my father had no interest in his
daughter's newfound obsession and she was

269
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,770
forced to find a job as a telephone
clock in order to fund the lessons.

270
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,270
She chose to be instructed by a
female pilots and Nita Nita Snook.

271
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,660
After 10 hours of lessons,

272
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,720
the media went solo in 1921.

273
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,550
The exhilarating experience encouraged
to onto achieving a full pilot's license

274
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,690
over the next few months.

275
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,280
As she progressed in her lessons,

276
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,470
Emilia became an airfield junkie.

277
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,610
She cropped her long hair and to began
wearing breeches boots and an oil stains

278
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,440
that the jacket,

279
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,570
the spline complaining about the high
cost of lessons she managed to scrape

280
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:03,030
together the money to buy a fast plane.

281
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,430
This was thanks largely to
her mother's inheritance.

282
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,490
This plane was an Esta
with a 28 foot wingspan.

283
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,130
Indeed it was the second Esta ever built,

284
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,900
renamed this plane canary.

285
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,100
During these early years,

286
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:18,090
Amelia didn't consider herself a good
enough flyer to appear in public events.

287
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,660
However,

288
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,740
her humility didn't preclude a few
appearances to shows and two attempts at

289
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,480
record setting in the La area.

290
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,720
The press was also beginning to mention
her as one of the few women pilots in

291
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,440
the area.

292
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,430
By 1923,

293
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:33,060
she had turned into a confident pilots
that she was not a natural flower and

294
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,010
struggled throughout our instruction.

295
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,410
Many men and even some women
were pilots than Emilia,

296
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,460
but that persistence and
so bravery cetera pass.

297
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,001
In 19,

298
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,580
24,

299
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,410
Amelia's parents,

300
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,240
marriage finally ended in divorce,

301
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,740
a devastated Emilia saw no reason to
stay in California and she relocated to

302
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,990
Boston along with her
mother and her sister.

303
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,860
The following year,

304
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,400
she re enrolled at Columbia,

305
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,350
switching to majoring in engineering.

306
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,350
That's when she scored
a c minus in Algebra.

307
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,050
She wants again,

308
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,883
quit her studies.

309
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,050
She then applied for admittance to mit,

310
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,130
but was turned down

311
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,540
over the next few years.

312
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,940
I mean he works as a
number of menial jobs.

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,810
Eventually she ended up as a social
worker at a settlement house in Boston in

314
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:16,710
1928.

315
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,490
Her three year hiatus from flying ended
when she agreed to take a seat as a

316
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,190
passenger in log keeper on a
flight from New York to London.

317
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,780
The plane was a Fokker f seven,

318
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,660
the three meter float plane
piloted by Miss Stoltz.

319
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,450
The flight plane took off on
the morning of June the 17th,

320
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,001
then arrived,

321
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,560
did Barry Points in south
Wales nearly at 21 hours later,

322
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,810
despite her role being a minimal one,

323
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Emilia was now in the books
as the first woman to fly.

324
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:40,800
The North Atlantic,

325
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,330
resounding to the USA.

326
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,980
Emilia developed a close relationship
with George Putnam and New York

327
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,670
businessmen and form a publisher.

328
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,310
They had mess when she had
interviewed for a place on the APP.

329
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,480
Putnam helped to improve our flying skills
and to embark on a series of lecture

330
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:58,470
tours intended to promote the aircraft
industry and to encourage women to become

331
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,250
pilots.

332
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,240
Over the next few months.

333
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,310
She wrote her first autobiography,

334
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,210
20 hours,

335
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,910
40 minutes about a flight
across the North Atlantic.

336
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,470
On November the 22nd 19,

337
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:11,580
29 Emilia Saturday women's speed
record for a single engine monoplane.

338
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,361
The following year,

339
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:16,740
she purchased a Lockheed Vega executive
and in it she broke the speed record for

340
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:18,270
a course of 100 kilometers.

341
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,910
Emilia and George Putnam were
married on the seventh of February,

342
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:21,810
1931.

343
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,830
Over that next year.

344
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,580
She sat and spoke at several
altitude records on the 20th of May,

345
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:27,391
1932.

346
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,370
She took off from
newfoundlands in her vega,

347
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,010
touching down in a field
of cows in Londonderry,

348
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:32,580
Ireland.

349
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,810
Fifteen hours and 30 minutes later she
had just become the first woman to fly

350
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:38,610
solo across the North Atlantic

351
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,560
with her husband's flair for publicity.

352
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,310
She quickly became the most famous woman
flyer on the planet's Portland build

353
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:51,260
his wife as lady Lindy,

354
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,050
capitalizing on the massive
popularity of Charles Lindbergh.

355
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,060
Immediate was now a fully
fledged celebrity when she
made public appearances.

356
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,590
She needed police protection.

357
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,960
She bronch downs by designing
a range of clothing.

358
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,810
There's coffee table
look in January of 1935,

359
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,271
I mean the.

360
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:10,340
I became the first woman to
fly from Hawaii to California
in that he or she also

361
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:11,630
wrote our second biography,

362
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:15,440
the front of this while
continuing a hectic schedule
of lecture tours and public

363
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:16,274
appearances.

364
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,720
On July the 20th,

365
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:24,770
1935,

366
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,200
Emilia celebrated her 38th birthday.

367
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,080
She knew that she couldn't go
on breaking records forever.

368
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,500
Yes,

369
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,870
she still had one more
big ones and knockoff.

370
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,620
In fact,

371
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,670
it was the biggest of them all and that's
of course a flight around the world.

372
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,410
To achieve a round the world flight.

373
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,330
Amelia would need a bigger plane.

374
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,710
In early 1936,

375
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,180
she purchased a twin engine,

376
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:46,430
lucky 10 e electric airplane.

377
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:49,400
That was the product of the finest
technology available at the time.

378
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,630
It was a low wing monoplane
of metal construction with
constant speed propellers

379
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,790
powered by to Pratt Whitney,

380
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,530
wast [inaudible] 14,

381
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,600
550 horsepower engines.

382
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,650
The interior of the plane was modified
to take extra petrol tanks giving a

383
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:08,420
theoretical range of 4,000 miles
as announced to use of 4,000 feet.

384
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,740
The plane was also fitted with one of
the very first sperry automatic pilots in

385
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,560
order to relieve the physical
strain of flying on Emilia.

386
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,120
Despite this innovation,

387
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,620
it became apparent that Emilia words need
navigational assistance to fly across

388
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,910
the Pacific Ocean or
navigational knowledge was
rudimentary and so Irish bond

389
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,200
navigator Fred Noonan,

390
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,600
was recruited for the
world record attempts.

391
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,250
Noonan was keen to be involved,

392
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,210
but that was one aspect
of the navigational set
that he wasn't happy with.

393
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,620
The only way the navigator could reach
the pilot was by crawling along a catwalk

394
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,480
over the intervening fuel tanks.

395
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,040
All system was devised.

396
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,150
Web I resend messages,

397
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,810
could be clipped to the line of a bamboo
fishing pole and passed between them,

398
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,790
but this inadequate method in pad,

399
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,370
the crucial element of teamwork,

400
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,340
the plan's route for the round
the world flies began in Oakland,

401
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,130
California with the first
landing place in Honolulu,

402
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,420
Hawaii from them.

403
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,700
It continues in a westerly direction,

404
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:10,120
taking advantage of prevailing winds
in order to maximize publicity.

405
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,100
Partner required his wife
to keep a detailed diary and
post entry stem from each

406
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:14,650
stop.

407
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,800
He would edit them so he could rush out
the book as soon as she achieved the

408
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:18,340
record.

409
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,420
Now the first leg of the round,

410
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:23,350
the world flight took off from
Oakland's at 1630 on march the 17th,

411
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,310
1937.

412
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,310
The flight to Honolulu,

413
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,710
it was smooth and uneventful,

414
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,200
taking 15 hours and 47 minutes.

415
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,010
The next stop was to be the tiny
American territory of Holland island,

416
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,020
1,800 miles away.

417
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,520
Immediately things went wrong.

418
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,800
The plane swung to the rice
just after to take off.

419
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,970
Then grounds looping.

420
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:41,410
As the undercarriage collapsed.

421
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,100
Fortunately,

422
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,070
Emilia managed to land
without any injury or fire,

423
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,880
but the world record attempt had to be
put on hold as the plane was created and

424
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,590
sent back to Lockheed for rebuilding.

425
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,570
The rebuilding was completed on May.

426
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:55,480
The 17th efforts were made to
reduce the weight of the plane,

427
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,020
one of which undoubtedly contributed
to the tragedy that was to come,

428
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,030
the trailing area,

429
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,000
which allowed them to request a bearings
on 500 kilohertz from ground stations

430
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,660
was removed three days after the
rebuilds electra was delivered to them,

431
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,950
Emilia Ans Noonan took off from
Oakland's for the second time because of

432
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:12,850
seasonal changes.

433
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,870
It was decided that this new attempt
would be done in the reverse direction.

434
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,930
The first link was to Miami
and then onto Puerto Rico,

435
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,800
Venezuela,

436
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,610
Dodge Guinea,

437
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,470
and in early June if you ones in Brazil,

438
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,311
the following days,

439
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:27,160
we spent servicing the engines
and checking the instruments.

440
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,660
The 1,900 mile flight across the South
Atlantic was made on the seventh of June,

441
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,830
landing the car,

442
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,570
Senegal Virginie across Africa and it
for days it was followed by the longest

443
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,850
leg of 1,950 kilometers,

444
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,020
do karate and India.

445
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,520
There the plane was serviced by Imperial
Airways along with members of the

446
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,690
British Raf on June the 17th.

447
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,820
If you want to dumb dumb near cal
Calacatta landing in the middle of a

448
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,230
torrential rainstorm after
refueling of Bangkok,

449
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,370
if you want to Singapore,

450
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,830
from there as onto bang done in Java here,

451
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:59,460
the electric develop some
kinds of instrument false
on the flight to Sarah buyer

452
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:00,081
in East Java.

453
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,570
The problem reoccurred
forcing them back to Bandung,

454
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,410
whether where repair facilities on June
the 29th they flew to lie in New Guinea,

455
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,270
the 1,200 mile flight was completed in
seven hours and 43 minutes so far the

456
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,400
paranoid traveled 22,000 miles.

457
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,860
The Pam must have been
extremely tired by this point,

458
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,240
but the greatest challenge,

459
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,320
it's still lay ahead of them and that
was of course crossing the Pacific.

460
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,810
The next objective was howland island,

461
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:33,430
some 2,566 miles away.

462
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,550
The two spans June the 30th in
preparation for the mammoth flight,

463
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,411
several witnesses,

464
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:40,660
so they should reported that a noonan was
drinking heavily on this day and we're

465
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,130
still doing so in the evening.

466
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,020
As Emilia attended a dinner party,

467
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,820
they took off at 10:00 AM on July.

468
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:49,360
The second eye witnesses reported that
the Electra lifted off sluggishly,

469
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,060
sang downwards towards the sea,

470
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,570
and then began a very slow claim to the
east and no one ever saw them again.

471
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,840
The last known position of the electro
was near the Nigga manny violence.

472
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,820
The last radio message from Amelia was,

473
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,870
we must be on you,

474
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,210
but gas is running low.

475
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,320
Have been unable to reach you by radio.

476
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,120
We are flying at 1000 feet.

477
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,500
The official search efforts to find the
missing plane and it's famous occupants

478
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,390
lasted until July the 19th,

479
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,410
1937.

480
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,930
The RNC search by the US Navy and Coast
Guard was the most expensive in u.

481
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:24,764
s history,

482
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,650
still no physical evidence of the plane
or the remains of Emilia in Newnan

483
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,400
wherever found over the decades the
speculation over what happened to Amelia

484
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,890
earhart has intensified in 2017.

485
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:38,580
A photo emerged that purported to show
we're back view of Emilia and sitting on

486
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:39,930
a pier in the Marshall Islands.

487
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,530
However,

488
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,580
this photo was debunked when it was proven
that it was actually taken in 1935 to

489
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,260
years before Amelia disappeared.

490
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,900
Then in March of 2018 and anthropology,

491
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:52,680
professor at the University of Tennessee
named Richard Jensen argue to the

492
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:52,981
bones,

493
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,300
found on the islands of Nikki,

494
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,770
my in 1940,

495
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,830
where 99 percent likely to
be those of Amelia earhart.

496
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,310
The bones were analyzed in 1941 and
determined to be those via mail,

497
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,490
but John's believes that that
analysis was deeply flawed.

498
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,030
Yes,

499
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,730
other scientists uphold
the original findings.

500
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,450
While we may never know what
really happened to you immediately,

501
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,810
it depends quite certain that's the
tantalizing mystery of her disappearance.

502
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,111
Well,

503
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:19,140
keep her name in the headlines
for many years to come,

504
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,050
so I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.
