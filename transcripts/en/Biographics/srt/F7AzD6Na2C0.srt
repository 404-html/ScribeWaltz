1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,070
We live in a world of overuse type,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,060
tentatively still,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,560
it's hard to overstate the phenomenon
that is youtube and just over a decade,

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:12,561
it has risen from nothing to 70 billion
hours of video watched every month.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,530
It is also the third most visited site
on the Internet with 80 percent of

6
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:18,810
viewers coming from
outside the United States.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,990
It has more than one point 5 billion
monthly users who are entertained by 400

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,320
hours worth of video,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,920
uploaded every 60 seconds
and on top of all of that,

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,800
it's made a lot of people a lot of money,

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,220
but have you ever stopped and
wondered how Youtube came about?

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,430
It's a fascinating story and today
you're going to discover it all as we go

13
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:41,550
behind the scenes to bring
you the real youtube story

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,110
said with a chance encounter in 1999,

15
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:53,861
Eric Skaggs,

16
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:54,720
a local entrepreneur,

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,140
was finishing up some work on his website
at the College of Business Computer

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,270
Lab at Indiana University in Pennsylvania.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,710
His website was called,

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,610
go get it now.

21
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:08,410
Josh carbon was an amalgamation of email
search engine and web hosting combined

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,230
into a single interface as he
was about to leave the building.

23
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:13,840
Scag saw a tall guy and
a baseball cap coming in.

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,070
They struck up a conversation and skaggs
learned that this guy was Chad Hurley.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,060
He was a graphics arts may job who
was looking for an idea for a website.

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,440
The idea that skaggs gave to honey wants
to provide to the inspiration for the

27
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:27,970
youtube revolution.

28
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,550
He told him that in the future,

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
television and computers
would become fully integrated.

30
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,251
Furthermore,

31
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:37,030
people would be able to use their cell
phones to create home videos and they

32
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:40,000
would want a platform to share
them with friends and family.

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,510
Remember,

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,140
this was all at a time when there were
no cameras in phones and TV and the

35
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,420
Internet were very different animals.

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,111
The idea of,

37
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:47,261
well,

38
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:48,760
it was a little overwhelming for her,

39
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:50,950
the and distorted away
for future reference.

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,230
After graduating from Indiana
University with a finance degree,

41
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,940
these started looking for employment
in the exciting new internet industry.

42
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,700
He picked up a wired magazine
from his local grocery store,

43
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,980
which featured the top
10 internet companies.

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,280
Holly sat down and redesigns
those companies' logos,

45
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,760
sending them to the marketing
departments of the respective companies,

46
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,820
the one he did for a company that you
might have heard of paper or caught the

47
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,530
eye of co founder Elon Musk,

48
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,610
and before he knew as Hurley was hired
as the company's first graphic designer,

49
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,440
it was a paypal that holly was able to
pick the brains of the most brilliant

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,150
techie neds in the industry.

51
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,310
The two smartest guys in the room where
Steve Chen and corrine Shannon was born

52
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:37,380
in Taiwan in 1978 with this family moving
to the United States when he was eight

53
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,080
years old,

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,500
he had attended the Illinois Mathematics
and science academy where he proved to

55
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,670
be a math prodigy.

56
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,630
His passion was computer engineering and
he went on to study computer science at

57
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,860
the University of Illinois.

58
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,650
He began working for paypal in 1999.

59
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,630
A few months before holly had
was born in Germany in 1979.

60
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:58,120
Moving with his family
to the US when he was 13,

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,150
from the stance,

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,300
Joanne was a computer whiz in school.

63
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,500
He wrote computer programs,

64
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,030
posting them on the Internet for free.

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,610
It also helps to set up
the school's email system,

66
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,870
just like Steve Chen.

67
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,830
Karen went to the University of Illinois
where he studied computer science after

68
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,590
a number of internships with a
range of technology companies.

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,640
He sought employment with paypal in the
year 2000 where he was put to work on

70
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,690
designing the company's anti
fraud security system early.

71
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,070
The graphic designer Chen,

72
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,100
the engineer and Korean.

73
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,350
The systems go real soon,

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,250
found each other and spends more and more
time brainstorming ideas for their own

75
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,070
startup.

76
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,760
For five years,

77
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,180
they kicked around ideas while building
up that knowledge and experience a

78
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,990
paypal.

79
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,000
Then in January of 2005,

80
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,800
he was hosting a dinner party at his home.

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,210
Jen was in attendance and he began using
a camcorder to take some video of the

82
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,044
festivities.

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,020
The next day they wanted to share
the video with those who had been in

84
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:47,650
attendance.

85
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,250
The problem was that the video files
were way too big to send diver email,

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,940
and even though there were a few photo
sharing websites such as flicker and

87
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,750
shutterfly,

88
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,630
nothing existed for the
sharing of video online.

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,050
It was at this point that the seed that
had been planted years before came to

90
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,580
life teaming up with Korean.

91
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,520
They decided to create a
website to share videos.

92
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,480
The idea was to use the video sharing
platform to create a dating site.

93
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,840
People would post videos of themselves
and they could view these and respond if

94
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:14,860
they liked what they saw.

95
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,590
They called it tune in hookup.

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,610
They launched this site within days and
then waited for the users to come are

97
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,520
the world.

98
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:24,520
Nothing happens in an attempt to
get some content up on the site.

99
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,880
They placed ads on craigslist
offering to pay people to post videos.

100
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,860
Still no one was interested and
tune in hookup became a huge flop.

101
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,760
The trio,

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
they were disheartened,

103
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,890
but it's not dismayed.

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,410
Shortly after the demise of
their first joint venture,

105
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,430
Joanne was frustratingly searching
online for a video of Janet Jackson's

106
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,460
infamous 2004 superbowl halftime show
wardrobe malfunction because there was no

107
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,020
user friendly platform
for sharing video content.

108
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,030
He wasn't able to satisfy his breast
fetish together with Harley and Chen.

109
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,810
He designed it to do something about it,

110
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,950
stripping away the Lane Dayton concepts
if they were left with a video uploading

111
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,150
and sharing platform,

112
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,850
or they needed now was
a name for that website

113
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,070
on February the 14th,

114
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:09,940
2005,

115
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,490
and a humble apartment above
a California pizza shop.

116
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,400
The trio began building
their new website initially,

117
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:18,970
the apparently in reference to Janet
Jackson's unwitting contribution that they

118
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,530
wanted to call it a boob tube,

119
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,860
realizing that that sounded too much
like a porn site that they began playing

120
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,340
around with words that conveyed the
idea of personalized television.

121
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,870
Harking back to the days when
the TV was called the tube,

122
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,250
thanks to the Catholic rate,

123
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,100
you've that powered is one of the three.

124
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,590
No one knows which one
came up with youtube.

125
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,940
It sounded perfect.

126
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,660
They were short,

127
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,170
catchy,

128
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,590
fun,

129
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,110
and it perfectly summed
up what they were about.

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,450
When early applies to
register the domain name,

131
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,680
the idea was to go with youtube
with a view instead of y o u,

132
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,660
however that domain was already taken,

133
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,550
which forced him to proceed a tube,

134
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,690
but with the three letter word,

135
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,750
you hurley each and immediately set about
writing down the goals for at the top

136
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:02,570
of that list was ease of user experience
loading and to watching videos had to

137
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,530
be super easy so that even the most
computer illiterate person could do it.

138
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,240
They've been divided up the workload.

139
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,340
Chad Hailey was in charge of the
look and design of the site is well.

140
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:14,660
There's tagging and labeling uploaded
videos to make them easier for viewers to

141
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:15,200
find.

142
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,531
Steve,

143
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,700
Jen was the engineered.

144
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,150
He made sure that the site was running
smoothly and that video's played without

145
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:20,961
lagging to read.

146
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:21,291
Korean.

147
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,220
Meanwhile uses programming skills to
get the site up and running and looking

148
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,940
great.

149
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,840
Unlike the other two,

150
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,510
Korean chose not to be an
employee of the company.

151
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,080
Instead,

152
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,380
his role is that of an informal advisor.

153
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,960
This allowed him to focus on the
graduate studies and computer science at

154
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,100
Stanford University.

155
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,660
The first video ever uploaded onto
youtube was an 18 seconds long of Korean,

156
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,510
but the San Diego Zoo
entitled me at the zoo.

157
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,990
You can still watch this historic clip
on the site where it has been seen by

158
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,730
more than 30 million people.

159
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,210
Holly,

160
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,710
he was put in charge of marketing.

161
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,550
He started a competition where different
youtube used though was given an Ipod

162
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,770
Nano every day for eight weeks.

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,890
People aren't points by referring
a friend or posting a video.

164
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,970
The more points you gains,

165
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,980
the greater your chances
of winning the ipod.

166
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,520
The promotion works and people began to
flooding the site with video concepts.

167
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,330
However,

168
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,800
this it created a problem.

169
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,270
So much content was coming on board that
youtube was running out of bandwidth.

170
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,710
This made video playback,

171
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,540
excrutiatingly slaves.

172
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,010
They were desperately in need of more
storage capacity which required money,

173
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,350
but as of yet so they weren't making any.

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,380
Fortunately on the basis of
future ad revenue forecasts,

175
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:31,400
they were able to secure a three point
$5,000,000 venture capital loan in

176
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,170
November of 2005 just a month earlier.

177
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,240
A nice promotional video
featuring Brazilian football
star Renelle denia became

178
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,000
the first youtube clips
or reach 1 million views

179
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,640
by the beginning of 2006 youtube grains
and more than 60 employees and the site

180
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,620
had more than 100 million views.

181
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,280
This was an astounding level of growth
considering that just 12 months earlier,

182
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,880
they literally couldn't pay people
to post videos on their website.

183
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,680
Over the course of its first year.

184
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,930
The nature of the content is
being loaded onto youtube.

185
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,760
It evolved for the first few months.

186
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,610
The majority of clips were
of the home movie variety,

187
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,360
but then more and more how to videos
began appearing with advice being offered

188
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:13,850
on how to do everything from
changing the oil in your car,

189
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,370
do the proper technique
for doing a barbell squat.

190
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,270
As a result,

191
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,260
youtube was fast becoming the goatee
source for both entertainment and

192
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,094
information.

193
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,551
In June,

194
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:23,361
2006,

195
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,850
youtube ends to contract
with NBC television.

196
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,830
Say you turned by NBC.

197
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,480
He would previously forced you to.

198
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:33,260
You have to remove the Saturday night
live clip after it became viral online.

199
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,681
Now,

200
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,300
NBC agreed to pay you to you,

201
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:37,720
but to place promotional
clips of their shares.

202
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,350
These were things such
as behind the scenes,

203
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,730
interviews and other features.

204
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,430
Youtube was by now we're attracting the
attention of the biggest players in the

205
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:49,264
web universe.

206
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,910
The site was wildly
popular with viral videos,

207
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,350
regularly appearing on TV,

208
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:54,340
news broadcasts,

209
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:57,300
and even entire being
devoted to youtube content.

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,560
The sort of global reach that Youtube had
acquired was extremely inviting to the

211
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,270
biggest player of them all.

212
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
In October of 2006,

213
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,750
the Google Corporation purchased
you to you for a staggering,

214
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:08,730
at one point six,

215
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,020
$5 billion dollars.

216
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,380
The three tech notes from paypal now
have more money than they could possibly

217
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,430
spend an entire lifetime.

218
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,720
Just like being independently
wealthy beyond measure early,

219
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,190
and Jen stayed with Youtube.

220
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,850
In fact,

221
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,640
they were thrilled to be working
with central web giants as Google.

222
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,810
They now had the freedom to focus on
adding new technology to the website in an

223
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,420
effort to encourage people to
stay on the site for longer.

224
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,290
They added extra features including
suggestions of follow up videos that the

225
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,970
viewer might be interested in watching.

226
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,750
They also set to work on making the
youtube experience available through a

227
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,340
greater range of devices.

228
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,121
Youtube is mobile.

229
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:45,550
App lets people watch videos on their
cell phones and people could now add a

230
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,231
youtube clips,

231
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,090
do that websites and their blogs.

232
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,600
It'll move.

233
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,780
It emphasized just how dominant
youtube was in people's lives.

234
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,790
Time magazine featured a youtube screen
on the cover of it's 2006 person of the

235
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,791
year,

236
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,624
issue

237
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,581
in May,

238
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:02,420
2007,

239
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,310
but partner program that was launched.

240
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,050
This allowed people who uploaded videos
to have a share in the ad revenue

241
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,240
generated by the advertising that
was played during their video.

242
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,350
Now for the first time,

243
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,100
everyday people were able to tend
their hobbies into successful online

244
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:16,934
businesses.

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,160
The program which is
still in operation today,

246
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,570
pays uploaders around 55 percent of
the ad revenue over the last decades.

247
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,380
This revenue source has paid off big
time for a relatively small number of

248
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:28,860
creators who are known as Youtube,

249
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,930
as people have created massive
followings and huge annual earnings.

250
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,070
They've also been able to leverage their
popularity to obtain sponsorship deals

251
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:40,520
with merchandisers who are keen to
get their products in the videos.

252
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,120
Some of these youtubers have
even landed movie and TV roles.

253
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,070
As a result of that online fame,

254
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,490
2007 was also the year that
youtube began impacting politics.

255
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,630
Seven of the 13 candidates for the
presidency of the United States announced

256
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,430
their campaigns through youtube.

257
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,030
This was followed by the first youtube
presidential debates which featured

258
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,740
questions submitted by viewers.

259
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,060
Then in 2009,

260
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:11,260
the capability was introduced to to upload
and watch three d videos on youtube.

261
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:11,471
Well,

262
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,100
that same year,

263
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,670
these staggering milestone of 1
billion views per day was reached.

264
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,900
Less than three years later,

265
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,730
that number had mushroomed to 4 billion.

266
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,160
The first video to reach 1 billion views
once the unforgettable gangnam style by

267
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:24,730
psy,

268
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,440
which reached the milestone on
December the 21st 2012 in 2011.

269
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,450
The new feature of live
streaming was added.

270
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,781
Now,

271
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:35,590
major world events can be watched
in real time making youtube a viable

272
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:39,610
alternative to the television Sas because
youtube was soon to prove that it was

273
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,610
more than just a recorder
of historical events.

274
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,750
January the 25th,

275
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:48,670
2011 was a day of protest against the
government of President Mubarak in Cairo,

276
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,270
Egypt.

277
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,080
Throughout that day,

278
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,080
video of the proclaimed a day of rage
began appearing on this inspired and

279
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,410
emboldened thousands of Egyptian citizens
who came pouring out into the streets.

280
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,220
The protests went on for 18 days and
the protesters were able to use youtube

281
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,420
along with facebook and
twitter to galvanize the
support that would eventually

282
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,470
lead to change.

283
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,070
Uber x regime reacted to the skillful
use of the Internet on the positive it's

284
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,700
detractors by imposing a sweeping
crackdown of the Internet.

285
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,900
This only further enraged the protesters
eventually forcing move or act to step

286
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,901
down and democratic elections to be held
for the first time in decades in 2011,

287
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:27,340
there was also a major
overhaul of the websites.

288
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:27,820
Look,

289
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,020
the video channels were displayed in a
central column and the Youtube logo was

290
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:32,680
updated.

291
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,950
The Google chrome browser was also
integrated so that viewers could watch

292
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,660
youtube at directly through Google.

293
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,190
Plus two years after that,

294
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,370
youtube began offering paid
subscriptions for a monthly feed.

295
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,090
This service allowed subscribers do you
watch longer ad free videos as well as

296
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:46,924
movies,

297
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,990
so one of the founders
of youtube up to now,

298
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,670
well in October of 2010,

299
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:59,340
Chad Hurley steps down the CEO of youtube
handing over the reigns to Salonica

300
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,810
Monga he committed to staying
on as an advisor to the company.

301
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,160
Steve Chen left the company.

302
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,870
It's about the same time
and the teeth again,

303
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,520
working together on a new venture,

304
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,570
a systems.

305
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,510
Their headline product was an
iphone app called a mixed base,

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,100
which allows users to shoot,

307
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,700
edit,

308
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,960
and share video clips.

309
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,600
Avl Systems has acquired a
number of other companies,

310
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,230
including delicious and tap 11 chantelle.

311
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,020
It was also a major sponsor of the
USF one formula one racing team.

312
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,390
He is also a part owner of the NBA team,

313
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,710
the Golden State Warriors,

314
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,730
and the mls,

315
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,050
Los Angeles football club.

316
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,220
In 2014,

317
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,020
after 15 years of collaboration,

318
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:36,310
Chen and Harley parted company jobs took
over full control of mixed base while

319
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:39,760
Chen went over to Google ventures
as an entrepreneur in residence,

320
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,430
making it clear that there was
no animosity in the passing.

321
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:46,330
Chen explains actually it was a very
personal and difficult decision to make,

322
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,520
but with the decisions
as an Avon to mix this,

323
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,950
it became pretty clear mixed.

324
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,710
It was chance idea before we started
Davis and even at Youtube and if I feel

325
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,210
driven to work on other projects,

326
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:59,110
then I'm just getting in the way of mixed
bit and the team and corrine completed

327
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:02,590
his graduate studies at the University
of Illinois in emerging with a master's

328
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,790
degree in computer science.

329
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,810
Of the three founders.

330
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,700
He received the lowest portion of stock.

331
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,420
However,

332
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,890
this was still enough for him to around
$64,000,000 from the sale to Google in

333
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:14,290
2018 launch to university ventures,

334
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,460
which provides mentorship,

335
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,760
expertise and contacts for college
students who wants to take innovative

336
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,020
projects to the next level.

337
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,290
Grimm was also one of the first investors
in Airbnb in 2009 towards the end of

338
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:29,950
2013 crim hit the headlines
when he objected along with
many other youtube users

339
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,880
to Google's requirements that commenting
on youtube videos only be done through

340
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,000
a google plus account.

341
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,770
He showed his displeasure by changing the
description on his iconic near the zoo

342
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:39,640
video to read.

343
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,390
I cannot comment here anymore since
I don't want a google plus account.

344
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,490
As a result of Karen stance backs
up by a 240,000 signature petition,

345
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,670
Google dropped its requirements that
commenters must use their google plus

346
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,533
products.

347
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,980
It is truly mind blowing to contemplate
just how big youtube will become the

348
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,630
next few years.

349
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,560
New Features are constantly being rolled
out to enhance the viewer experience

350
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,880
has already replaced tv as the main source
of entertainment information from any

351
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:11,420
people.

352
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,980
According to Google executive chairman,

353
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:13,640
Eric Schmidt,

354
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,410
the exponential growth of youtube will
bring it six or 7 billion unique visitors

355
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,273
per month.

356
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,460
With that growth largely being
driven from the developing world,

357
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,300
Youtube has become a launching pad
for a growing number of breakout stars

358
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,850
including Justin Bieber
and Grayson chance.

359
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,200
There have even been a number of TV
shows that began life as youtube skits,

360
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,660
including broad city and workaholics.

361
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,850
Youtube is the most
public place in the world,

362
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,730
accessible from the privacy
of our own bedrooms.

363
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,520
It has created unprecedented
opportunities for learning,

364
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,480
entertaining,

365
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,410
and earning a living,

366
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,850
but just like anything,

367
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,570
youtube,

368
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,530
it can be abused.

369
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,311
For one thing,

370
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,380
it can be mind numbingly addictive.

371
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,380
You might sit down to watch a three
minute clip him three hours later.

372
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:58,400
You're still slouched in front of the
computer watching cats playing piano or

373
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,293
hopefully you know,

374
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
watching one of our videos as well.

375
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,690
Speaking of biographics videos,

376
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,340
please do not forget to subscribe.

377
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:07,370
We put out brand new videos
every Monday and Thursday.

378
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:07,551
Now,

379
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,740
obviously this video was a bit different.

380
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,080
It's all first biography of a company.

381
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,810
Please let us know what you think
of it in the comments below.

382
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,850

383
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,940

might be interested in us doing.

384
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:20,360
Again,

385
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,640
leave those in the comments and as always,

386
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,990
thank you for watching.
