1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,460
Few would have believed that the frail
asthmatic little boy who loved to collect

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,890
insects would amount to anything special,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,660
much less the youngest and most
robust presidents in US history.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Theodore Roosevelt is transformation
from sickly child to master of the bully

5
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:21,761
pulpit and the ultimate symbol of American
strength and vitality is an inspiring

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,160
story of the power of self determination.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,570
And this week's biographics graphics,

8
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:28,130
we uncover his story.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,860
Theodore Roosevelt's the future.

10
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:46,861
26 presidents of the United States was
born in New York City on October the 27th

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,390
1858 to Theodore Roosevelt,

12
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,860
Sr and Martha,

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,820
but luck Roosevelt.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,900
Roosevelt Senio was one of the
leading citizens of New York City,

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,040
Theodore Junior,

16
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,150
who was known as TD,

17
00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:59,560
was the second child.

18
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:03,760
So the affluent couple who lived in
a luxurious home on Manhattan island,

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,550
dd you had a sister banner who
was four years older than him,

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,490
younger brother values would
follow two years later.

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,110
And then there was another sister,

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:11,920
Corinne.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,380
Oh yeah,

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,420
rafter that TD suffered from
asthma from the age of three.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,680
His condition indeed was so bad that
he spent much of his early years in bed

26
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,120
unable to attend school,

27
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:22,901
his parents,

28
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,940
Hud tutors to teach him from home.

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,930
Despite his illness,

30
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,840
young TD relished the
opportunity to learn one,

31
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:30,010
see it lands how to read.

32
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:32,500
He became a voracious devour of books.

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,240
He love to fill his mind with tales of
central Nordic heroes as king I laugh and

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,313
Erik the red.

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,880
He was also fascinated with newspaper
stories about the exploits of the famous

36
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,900
British explorer,

37
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:45,880
Dr. David Livingston Td.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,870
He was a dreamer and he filled his
mind with dreams of tracking through

39
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,950
unchartered territories and
discovering team to tribes.

40
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,940
Young dd showed an unusual
curiosity about the natural world.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,590
One day buying a trip to the market.

42
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,030
He came across a dead seal in a book,

43
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:02,800
just stall.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,780
He was fascinated with the
fines and resent daily to
study and measure it with a

45
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:08,350
ruler.

46
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,280
Eventually he managed to take possession
of the seal scholars and take his home

47
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:16,060
where it became the prize exhibit of
his Roosevelt's from Museum of natural

48
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,511
history,

49
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,650
which he had sat off in his bedroom
from the age of 16 he began filling his

50
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:25,210
journals with observations about the
natural world is mother regularly took him

51
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,910
on trips to the country in
order to help alleviate his ass.

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Marin's CD made the most of
this opportunity to wonder
around in such if fish,

53
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,491
insect,

54
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:37,720
seals and buds that he could analyze
and then write about the Roosevelt

55
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:38,111
children.

56
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:42,250
They were raised under the norms of
Victorian society as members of the upper

57
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:42,581
class.

58
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,570
They didn't mix with the less wealthy
and strict Moore's of decency were

59
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,880
enforced and manners and politeness.

60
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:49,820
Where of automotives.

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,920
Timportance Sunday night was the day
for religious observance consisting of

62
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,440
church followed by a quiet contemplation.

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,230
Titty hated Sundays is,

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,620
this was the day he was not permitted to
indulge in his natural curiosity of the

65
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,340
world.

66
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,710
In 1869 when he was 10 years old,

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,760
tds family inbox on a tour
of Europe for 12 months.

68
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,550
The children were exposed to
the great science of England,

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,061
Germany,

70
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:13,451
France,

71
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,030
and Italy.

72
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,440
Yes,

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
TD.

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
He was not impressed.

75
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,600
He lays,

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,320
wrote,

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,780
I call,

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,910
nearly hated it,

79
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,950
as did my younger brother and sister.

80
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,540
Practically all the enjoyment we had
was an exploring any ruins or mountains

81
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,620
when we get away from our elders and
in playing and all different hotels.

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,700
When he was 13 DDS father
gave him his first shotgun.

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,850
He was dismayed to find
that he was a terrible shot,

84
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:40,150
which brought ridicule from his
peers what a friend's challenged him.

85
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,650
So you had a billboard in the distance.

86
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,790
He discovered the problem later recalling
not only was I able to read the sign,

87
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,710
I couldn't even see the letters.

88
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,470
He was extremely near sighted.

89
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,090
This had never realized it.

90
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,860
After telling his father
about the problem,

91
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,650
he was given a pair of
eyeglasses he wrote in his diary.

92
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,920
I had no idea how beautiful the world
was until I got those spectacles with is

93
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:02,531
improved.

94
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,040
Eyesight.

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,240
Didi was able to become even more
obsessive with his nature studies.

96
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,490
Hey,

97
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,940
Don's tax,

98
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,980
a dummy stuffing,

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,150
announcing birds that he shot and
adding them to is ever expanding natural

100
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,984
history museum.

101
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,820
In the winter of 1870 to
1871 the Roosevelts made of
trips in the Mediterranean

102
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,750
visiting Egypt,

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,590
the Holyland,

104
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,180
Syria grease and tucking.

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,320
Unlike the trip to Europe,

106
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,150
TD love this experience.

107
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,380
He made the most of the opportunity to
shoot exotic birds and then stuff them to

108
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,000
take home and add to his collection.

109
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,530
When he was 13 TD was sent
off to Maine for a solo trip,

110
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:37,090
so improve his health on
the train journey north.

111
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,290
He found himself in a cabin with some of
the teenage boys in these skinny week.

112
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,940
The spectical last matic boy,

113
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,350
they found him easy mock.

114
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,220
They roughed him up,

115
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,020
beefing him bruised and
humiliated when he returns home.

116
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,540
He told his father about the incidents.

117
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,470
Roosevelt Sr told his son that he needed
to develop as body physically so that

118
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,550
he could defend himself.

119
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,780
A prize fighter was hired in
order to teach the boy how to box.

120
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,510
From this point onward TD,

121
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,710
it became obsessed with building his body.

122
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:03,850
He began lifting weights,

123
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,350
doing calisthenics and running.

124
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,310
He develops a great admiration for
those who possess strength and displayed

125
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,420
manly virility.

126
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,470
It was also determined to live
what he called the strenuous life.

127
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,230
The Roosevelt's were a family that were
driven by goals and afterwards sounding

128
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:25,370
from that trip to the Middle East.

129
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:30,020
They set one for the oldest son and that
was to gain entry to Harvard College in

130
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,160
just three years.

131
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,500
This was a terrific
challenge for young TD.

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
He had never gone to school and is all,

133
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,180
although was skilled in
languages nature in the classics.

134
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,610
He was rather deficient in mathematics.

135
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,300
A special tutor was high and over the
next two years he worked hard to improve

136
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,134
his skills.

137
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,360
The hot work get paid often.

138
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,380
In 1875 he passed the Harvard entrance
exams for a freshman at Harvard.

139
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:55,970
The Charles had name of TD which never
of done so he took to calling himself

140
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,870
Theodore.

141
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,890
He immediately took to college life
involving himself in political parades,

142
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,820
boxing tournaments,

143
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,930
and a rowing competition.

144
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,490
He also became a skilled debate or
taking on professors and fellow students

145
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,960
alike to is Deloitte.

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,710
He found himself readily accepted and
we've seen invited to join some of

147
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,960
Harvard's most prestigious societies,

148
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,100
fatals blissful existence there was
interrupted during a visit home in his

149
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,000
sophomore year.

150
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,350
He found that his father was gravely
ill with his beloved TD back home.

151
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,240
The old man's health revived some Watson.

152
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,130
The dangers seem to have passed,

153
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,680
but when Theodore returned
to Harvard for the new year,

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,990
his father took a sharp
turn for the worst.

155
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,310
Towards the end of February,

156
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,100
Theodore received a telegram
to return home urgently.

157
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,540
He never made it in time.

158
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,310
His father died that very night.

159
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,970
They had all was deeply depressed
as a result of his father's death.

160
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,480
However,

161
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,560
he refused to show any of this pain to
others instigating a pattern that he

162
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,180
would continue for the rest of his life.

163
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,830
He soldiered on disciplining his mind
and body to do what had to be done still

164
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,640
his grief,

165
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,170
and it was evident in his actions.

166
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,300
During a summer vacation to oyster bay.

167
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:01,130
He rode his horse to exhaustion.

168
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,110
When a dog insisted on chasing the horse,

169
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,090
he turned and he shot it.

170
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,250
They had also began hiking,

171
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,350
finding the release in the great outdoors.

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,760
He teamed with a crusty old adventure
by the name of Bill Seawall,

173
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,270
who served as his guide.

174
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,571
See,

175
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:18,410
we'll later recorded his impression of
Theodore Roosevelt at the time stating he

176
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,400
was fair minded.

177
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,690
Theodore was zen's.

178
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,730
Then he took pains to learn everything.

179
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,830
That was nothing beneath his notice.

180
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,300
I liked him right off.

181
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,150
I liked him clear though
that wasn't a quality in him.

182
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:29,984
I didn't like.

183
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,650
He wasn't had long or aggressive except
when necessary and just far as I could

184
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,220
see,

185
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,500
he wasn't a bit cocky though.

186
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,301
Other folks' thoughts.

187
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:38,870
So by his mid teens,

188
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,940
Theodore had developed
into quite a character,

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,920
never afraid to express his opinion.

190
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,280
He could always be counted on to be
the center of attention is unique.

191
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,600
Albus it's of approval.

192
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,830
Bully and de Lighters quickly
became trademark responses.

193
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,970
In 1879 he set his charms on a
young woman by the name of Annesley.

194
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
See that girl?

195
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,410
He said,

196
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,541
well,

197
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:57,681
hell,

198
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,340
vid pal,

199
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,600
she won't have me,

200
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,980
but I'm going to have her and have her.

201
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,740
He did.

202
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,490
He says out on a campaign to win the
Ellis' heart leading to their engagements

203
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,390
in early 1880 they had all graduated
from Harvard in June of that year,

204
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,210
the 21st and this class of 160 students.

205
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,530
Then in October,

206
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,730
he and Dallas,

207
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,623
we're married,

208
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,800
offer a short honeymoon.

209
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,520
Theodore enrolled in a law degree at
Columbia University while also working at

210
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,510
his uncle's law fan.

211
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,280
During his limited leisure time,

212
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:29,630
he decided to learn about the war of 1812
when we couldn't find a decent book on

213
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:30,440
the subject.

214
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,300
He decided to write one himself during
the summer of 1881 the young couple took

215
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:39,320
a trip to Europe while in Switzerland's
Theodore left his wife behind while he

216
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,370
climbs the matter one.

217
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,780
It was during this trip that he decided
to forego a legal career and he was

218
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:48,260
determined to set his sights
on becoming a politician.

219
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,230
Back.

220
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,070
Politics was actually

221
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,870
seen as being beneath men of wealth
and various friends tried to dissuade

222
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,040
Theodore's ambitions,

223
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,770
but that was always going
to be a losing proposition.

224
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:06,300
And on returning to New York,

225
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,890
he joined the Republican Party.

226
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,310
Yeah.

227
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,910
He was associating with a class of men
that he hadn't previously mixed with

228
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,800
rough men who were skilled in the low
blows and dirty tricks of stage politics.

229
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,130
Roosevelt soon learns their ways and
within months he had won the party's

230
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,980
nomination for a seat in
the New York state assembly.

231
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,040
It was a solid Republican
sesions Roosevelt's,

232
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,000
he won it handily,

233
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,260
Roosevelt tens up to take his seat to
the New York state capitol in Albany on

234
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:36,261
January the 22nd 1882 he cut the figure
of a dandy with is fine suit and his

235
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,620
upper crust ways.

236
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,710
He was ridiculed by Democrats
as well as Republicans.

237
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,581
Despite this,

238
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:41,881
he,

239
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,440
according to his own recollection,

240
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,050
rose like a rocket ship in New York,

241
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:46,830
politics,

242
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,790
Roosevelt politics.

243
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,160
They were grounded in self determination.

244
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:54,330
He firmly believed that each man
was in control of his own destiny,

245
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,400
but he also realized that the system,

246
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,170
it was grossly unfair with those with
the money and power having all of the

247
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,004
opportunities.

248
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,840
He made it his goal to bring about a
fairer assist and were all Americans have

249
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:11,340
the opportunity to succeed when he
wasn't working his way up the political

250
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,570
ladder in New York theater or ventured
out west in order to fulfill his love of

251
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,460
adventure and the outdoors.

252
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,470
In September of 1883 he made an
excursion to the Dakota badlands with the

253
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,240
express purpose of bringing home a buffalo
had as a trophy as with most things

254
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,200
he set his mind to.

255
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,940
He was successful in that goal.

256
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,680
During this trivial also purchased a
cattle ranch in November of 1883 Theodore

257
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,170
won his third terms of the
New York state assembly.

258
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,340
He returns to Alberni while his wife who
was heavily pregnant with their first

259
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,030
child,

260
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,080
went to live with his sister.

261
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,120
On February the 11th 1884 he received
a long awaited telegram announcing the

262
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,290
birth of the baby girl.

263
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,010
But this telegram had also told
him that Alice was very sick.

264
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,310
He rushed home to discover
that the news was even worse,

265
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,550
both his wife and his
mother or gravely ill.

266
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,860
They both died on the same day.

267
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,480
February the 14th 1884 that
night he wrote in his diary.

268
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,700
The light has gone from my life.

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,260
Theodore responded to the double tragedy
with the stoicism that epitomized as

270
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,094
personality.

271
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,060
After a few days of isolation be left
the baby in the care of his sister and

272
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,870
returned to Albany to see out his
time and the general assembly life,

273
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,290
I'm gonna have to go on [inaudible].

274
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,530
Energy for Roosevelt works tirelessly
to propel himself from state to national

275
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,130
politics.

276
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,670
His Brash on wavering style brought
into the attention of prominent men,

277
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:37,380
including an influential Bostonian
by the name of Henry Cabot Lodge.

278
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,370
By the ends of the year,

279
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:42,810
the 25 year old was being hired by
many as a future Republican leader.

280
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,410
However,

281
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,810
inside Roosevelt was an empty man.

282
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,640
He needed to get away from the rough
and tumble of politics in order to heal

283
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:51,474
himself.

284
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,840
At the end of 1884 Roosevelt retired
from politics and moved to one of his

285
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,400
ranches in North Dakota.

286
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,330
Theodore Roosevelt turns up to the small
Dakota town of the door addressed in

287
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,164
Buckskins.

288
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,980
He brandished a brand new Winchester
rifle as well as a hunting knife that had

289
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,360
bought from Tiffany's jewelers.

290
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,310
He was the quintessential dude and was
soon ridiculed by the hardened locals.

291
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,061
Despite this,

292
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,500
he revels in life.

293
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,190
In the West.

294
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,990
He displayed a steely courage,

295
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,360
which impressed all those
who came to know him.

296
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,650
Roosevelt hired his old tramping guide
bill seewell to come out and manage his

297
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:30,484
ranch for him,

298
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,010
but he didn't leave all
the hard work to his men.

299
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,510
He rode out on the range with them,

300
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:39,430
chased spooked cattle and stood guard
during long and bitterly cold nights.

301
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,140
In 1886 he captured a group of thieves
who would start on a boat and then took

302
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:47,140
them as prisoners on a three
day trek to the local sheriff.

303
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,430
During those three days.

304
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:53,080
He didn't sleep a wink cause he kept his
rifle trained on his captives following

305
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:58,081
the exceptionally harsh winter of 1886
to 1887 which kills half of his cattle

306
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:58,810
stock,

307
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,643
Roosevelt.

308
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,670
He returned east.

309
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,120
It was 30 pounds heavier than
when he left and was a harder,

310
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:06,070
more confidence fashion of itself.

311
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,480
Soon after resenting,

312
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,440
he matched dolphins.

313
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,440
I fell in love with a childhood
friend by the name of Edith Kero.

314
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,460
They were married on December the
second 1886 and would go on to have five

315
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,294
children together.

316
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,150
Roosevelt was soon approached
by Republican leaders,

317
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,930
urge to reenter politics.

318
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,480
They wanted him to run
for mayor of New York.

319
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,320
He accepted and campaigned hard despite
having little chance of winning.

320
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,420
He came in third place with 27% of the
vote thinking that his political career

321
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:38,961
was over.

322
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:41,900
He next put his efforts
into writing the book,

323
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,400
the winning of the West.

324
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,720
In 1888 Roosevelt gave stump speeches
for Republican presidential candidates.

325
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,680
Benjamin Harrison.

326
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,090
When he won the presidency,

327
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:52,970
Harrison was persuaded by
Theodore's political champion,

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Henry Cabot Lodge to appoints the
energetic Roosevelt's to the u s a Civil

329
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,370
Service Commission.

330
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,410
He spoke to the role with a vengeance.

331
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,220
Does that mean to find to the curb to
spoil system and enforce civil service

332
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:04,730
doors.

333
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,990
In 1894 Roosevelt was appointed president
of the board of New York City Police

334
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:09,650
Commissioners.

335
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,330
He then set about making improvements,

336
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:15,380
do these structure of the police force
rooting out corruption and imposing more

337
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,390
stringent standards for recruitment.

338
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,360
In 1897 again,

339
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,080
under the urging of Henry Cabot Lodge,

340
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:24,890
new President William Mckinley appointed
Roosevelt as the assistant secretary of

341
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:25,520
the navy.

342
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,210
He became a strong advocate for the
building of the strength of the navy.

343
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,220
When on February the 15th 1898 the u
s watershed mean exploded in Havana.

344
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:38,210
Harbor Roosevelt took it upon
himself to order a number of ships.

345
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,290
Do you prepare for war?

346
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,390
When war was declared a short time later,

347
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:45,720
Roosevelt resigned his post and forms
the first US volunteer cavalry regimens.

348
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,130
He was determined to be in
the thick of the action.

349
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,573
The

350
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,031
press stubs,

351
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:57,650
Roosevelt's Cavalry Regiment,

352
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,610
the rough riders.

353
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,890
After a period of training in San Antonio,

354
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:01,550
Texas,

355
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,020
they were shipped to Cuba.

356
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,250
That first action was at the battle of
last quest cmos where they forced the

357
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,470
Spanish to a band and
they're entrenched positions.

358
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,390
On July the first 1898 Roosevelt led
his men on the famous charge up cattle

359
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:14,780
hill.

360
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,810
It was the only man on horseback
making an easy target for the enemy.

361
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,880
Still without any care for his own safety.

362
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,700
He rode up and down the line
[inaudible] man off the hill,

363
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,300
also attempting to take the hill where
soldiers of the ninth us cavalry,

364
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,610
but these soldiers were
having a hard time of it.

365
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,380
A reporter for the New York Times
recorded the action stating Cardinal

366
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,330
Roosevelt's on horseback broke from the
woods behind the line of the ninth and

367
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,530
finding it's men buying in his way.

368
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:38,240
He shouted,

369
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,980
if you do not wish to go forward,

370
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,810
let my men pass please.

371
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,740
The junior officers of the ninth with
their negroes instantly sprang into line

372
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:49,550
with the rough riders since charged
at the blue block house on the right.

373
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,810
I speak of Roosevelt first because he
was without a doubt the most conspicuous

374
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,100
figure in the charge.

375
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,500
Roosevelt mounted high on horseback and
then charging the rifle pits at a gallop

376
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,060
and quiet alone made you
feel that you would like to.

377
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:02,720
Chia,

378
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,540
he wore on his Sombrero I
blue Polka dot handkerchief,

379
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,350
which has the advanced floated out
straight behind his head like a guide on

380
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,000
having reached the crest of the hill.

381
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,370
Roosevelt dismounted and
urged his men to follow him,

382
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,730
but that was yet another hill to conquer
and no sooner had the rough riders

383
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,230
scrambled to the top of cattle hill.

384
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,490
Then that dashing carnal set off for
San Juan Hill as men overpowered the

385
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:25,850
Spanish resistance and took possession
of both hills in the process.

386
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,380
Roosevelt's killed to Spanish tree bub,

387
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:32,270
who he said doubled over like a jack
rabbits following victory in Cuba,

388
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,830
Roosevelt returned to New York,

389
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:33,971
right.

390
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:37,550
It was convinced to run for governor
campaigning vigorously on his war record.

391
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:41,780
He won by just 1% of the popular
vote during his time as governor,

392
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,790
he developed the stylings platform,

393
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,980
which would underpin
his leisure presidency.

394
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,120
It was a passionate advocate for the
rights of the underprivileged was against

395
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:53,060
large corporations and
monopolies and champions.

396
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,160
The preservation of natural resources.

397
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,080
In 1900 Henry Cabot lodge and other
prominent Republicans urge Roosevelt's to

398
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,250
throw his hat into the ring
for the vacants Republican
vice-presidential spot in

399
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,290
the upcoming presidential elections.

400
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,543
Though reluctance,

401
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,150
he won the Republican nomination
pairing with President Mckinley with his

402
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:11,961
boundless energy.

403
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,450
He threw himself into a
barn storming campaign,

404
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:19,451
making 480 speeches in 23 states in the
end and Mckinley easily one and Theodore

405
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,760
Roosevelt was sworn in as
the vice president of the
United States on March the

406
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,310
first 1901 six months later,

407
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:32,390
President Mckinley was shot
while attending the Pan
American exposition in New

408
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,660
York.

409
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,500
He died eight days later as a result
of the 42 year old Roosevelt who was

410
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:40,340
propelled into the highest office in
the lands becoming the 26th president of

411
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:45,341
the United States on September the 14th
1901 he was the youngest man to ever

412
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,370
hold the position.

413
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,210
Roosevelt was very different man to
William Mckinley still valid and that he

414
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:00,090
would continue to pursue with
the policies of his predecessor.

415
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,051
At the same time,

416
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:04,830
he was determined to do stamp his mark
on the presidency in order to win a

417
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,600
second term in his own right.

418
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,620
A large part of the focus of Roosevelt's
domestic policies were focused on

419
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,020
breaking up the monopolies
of big business.

420
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,080
He instituted 44 antitrust suits
forcing the breaking up of the Northern

421
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,600
Securities Company and putting regulatory
controls on standard oil of all the

422
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,270
domestic policies that
Roosevelt was passionate about.

423
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:24,840
However,

424
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,130
none came close to the preservation
of wildlife than the environments he

425
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:29,701
established.

426
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:33,750
The United States forest service created
five national parks and place to total

427
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:37,260
of 230 million acres of lands
under public protection.

428
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,610
In terms of foreign policy,

429
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:39,270
Roosevelt,

430
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,920
he was an ardent imperialists.

431
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,140
He successfully mediated
the treaty of Portsmouth,

432
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:46,980
which brought an end to the
Russian Japanese war winning
a Nobel peace prize for

433
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:47,670
his efforts.

434
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,240
It was making a deal with the Panamanian
government for the building of a canal

435
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:56,241
led to the separation of Panama from
Columbia in 1903 and the 1904 presidential

436
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,061
election,

437
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:01,000
the Democrats put up Alton Brooks
Parker to face off against Roosevelt

438
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,260
campaigning on the promise to
give every American a square deal.

439
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:09,261
Roosevelt one that 56% of the popular
vote along with 336 of 476 electorial

440
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,060
votes during a second time and office
Roosevelt and began moving to the left of

441
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,080
his Republican base,

442
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,380
the Bush for a number of pretty radical
reforms including the eight hour

443
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:19,950
workday,

444
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,810
most of which they were
defeated in the house.

445
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,070
He had Declan's that he would not seek
a third term and so he became a lame

446
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:26,311
duck.

447
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,980
Presidents while thought early in
drawing the role of presidents,

448
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:33,390
he fells staying in office for more
than two terms would run the risk of

449
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,224
dictatorship

450
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,390
following the end of his
second term in office.

451
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,560
In March of 1909 Roosevelt went on an
African safari with a group of prominent

452
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,850
scientists and hunters.

453
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,050
The expedition was on behalf of the
Smithsonian Institute and was charged with

454
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,840
bringing back specimens
for the institutes museums.

455
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,250
The trip was successful in the group,

456
00:19:56,251 --> 00:20:01,251
came back with 11,400 specimens
ranging from insects to elephants.

457
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,910
When he returned to the United States,

458
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,750
Roosevelt was far from happy with
the performance of his successor,

459
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:07,650
William Taft,

460
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:11,250
to believing that Taft has made the
Republican's far too conservative.

461
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,400
He began to speak loudly of leading a
program of new nationalism which emphasize

462
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:17,970
Labor over capital.

463
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,240
By the time that the 1912
presidential election rolled around,

464
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:25,980
Roosevelt was convinced that only
he could save the Republican Party.

465
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,260
He challenge Taft in
the Republican primary.

466
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,590
However,

467
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,251
the Taft won.

468
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,860
The nomination is squeezing
Roosevelt to the sidelines.

469
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,130
Undeterred Roosevelt quit the
Republican's forming his own party,

470
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,210
the progressive's,

471
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,730
and he ran for president
as an independence.

472
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,310
He then went to the stumps
and appealed to the people.

473
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,240
On October the 14th 1912 Roosevelt
was giving a speech in Milwaukee,

474
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:48,250
Wisconsin when he was struck
by an assassin's bullet.

475
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,020
This shot was a perfect shot to the
heart and it penetrated his breast pocket

476
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,540
and slammed into a thick glasses case.

477
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,970
The bullets then thumped
into a heavy speech.

478
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,330
Manuscripts that he had chosen
not to use without missing a beat,

479
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,420
Roosevelt ensured that the
would be killer was apprehended.

480
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,460
Then he went right on with his speech,

481
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,211
the first word,

482
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,640
so the crowd after being headwear.

483
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,693
Ladies and gentlemen,

484
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,180
I don't know whether you're fully
understands that I have just been shot,

485
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,240
but it takes more than
that to kill a bull loose.

486
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,080
The bullet stayed in Roosevelt's
pectoral muscle until his death,

487
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,940
the 1912 presidential election.

488
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:26,410
It was won by the Democratic candidate
Woodrow Wilson with 42% of the popular

489
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:26,860
vote.

490
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,341
However,

491
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:32,341
Roosevelt did to beat the
incumbent presidents with
27% compared to 23% for Taft

492
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,350
during a South American expedition.

493
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:40,351
In 1913 to 1914 Roosevelt
contracted tropical fever
after suffering a leg wound,

494
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,810
which became badly infected by
the time he resides in New York,

495
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,720
he was 50 pounds lighter and deathly Pale.

496
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,940
The last few years were racked with pain
for the ones robust outdoor adventurer,

497
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,980
malaria bounce,

498
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,720
where common as where complications
of his leg inflammation.

499
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,010
The end came in the very early morning
hours of January the sixth 1919 after he

500
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:09,610
had complained about not being able to
breathe the night before the doctor was

501
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,070
summons and after some
treatments he felt better.

502
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,910
However,

503
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,000
he died in his sleep as a result
of a blood clot in the lungs.

504
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,920
When he heard of his father's demise,

505
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,940
his oldest son,

506
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:20,110

has siblings with the
words the old lion is dead.

508
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,940
It'll Roosevelt.

509
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,590
It was 60 years old.

510
