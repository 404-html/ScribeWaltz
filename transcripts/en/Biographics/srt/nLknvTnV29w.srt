1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,670
Just before we get
started with video today,

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:02,510
you've clicked on this one,

3
00:00:02,511 --> 00:00:05,120
you already knows about a place rather
than a pass and we're trying something

4
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:05,301
new.

5
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:06,290
We're experimenting.

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,741
Why not?

7
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,390
This is super interesting.

8
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:08,880
I promise.

9
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,270
It's like a biography of Chernobyl,

10
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,160
the place and what happened there.

11
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,620
I really think you'll enjoy
it and let's get into it.

12
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,821
I exactly.

13
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,370
One 23:00 AM on April the 26,

14
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,330
1986.

15
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:22,700
The weld suffered its worst ever.

16
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,850
Nuclear disaster outside of the
town of preppers in Ukraine,

17
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:30,320
reacting them before the local nuclear
power plants quite literally blew its

18
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:30,860
top.

19
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,000
It released more nuclear material into
the atmosphere than the Hiroshima and

20
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,580
Nagasaki explosions combined.

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,810
The resulting cloud of death blanketed
half of Europe led to the total

22
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:46,190
evacuation of parts of north Ukraine
and southern Bela reuss and triggered a

23
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:51,191
process that would end up five years
later with the complete collapse of the

24
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,440
Soviet Union.

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,700
When we talk about disasters,

26
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,790
there are certainly a scale
of disasters in this one.

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,620
It rang someone near the top,

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,390
but how much do most of us really know
about history's worst nuclear accidents?

29
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,710
If you go on wikipedia right now,

30
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:08,120
it will tell you the total number
of deaths due to drug noble is a 31.

31
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,320
The overall impression that you get is
that it's a disaster that's noticeable,

32
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,800
but not really on the same league
as something like nine slash 11,

33
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,090
but impressions,

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,760
they can be misleading for
those living in the USSR,

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,450
Chernobyl,

36
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,890
it was there 9:11.

37
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,160
It affected workers from each
republic in the Soviet Union.

38
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:29,270
It permanently damaged trust in the
government and it left behind a deadly

39
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:33,080
legacy that still being
reckons with to this very day.

40
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,610
In the biographics video today,

41
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:36,350
we're looking at the story of a town,

42
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,000
the blue up at embark.

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,820
It was a chilly February day in 1970
when the first brick of the new city was

44
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,650
laid some 90 kilometers north of Kiev.

45
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,720
Privets was officially under
construction as the ninth of the Ussr,

46
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,680
so called atomic towns.

47
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:08,700
Places built solely for the families
of those people working at the nuclear

48
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,390
plants.

49
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,840
In this case that demands the Vladimir
Lenin blondes just three kilometers

50
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,380
north.

51
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,010
The plants,

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,910
you know today,

53
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,600
it's true noble life in bread,

54
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,101
but it was fun.

55
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,740
I'll be on the standards common
in the Soviet Union at that time.

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,430
The automatic towns with Moscow,

57
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,410
his pride and joy,

58
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,930
those who lived in them could
expect fully stocked shops,

59
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,980
hospitals with actual equipment since
apartments that were the envy of people

60
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,320
from Vilnius to have a lot of all stock.

61
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,560
Even by these high standards
out there was something else.

62
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,300
Former residents still talk of.

63
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,950
Local forests replete with natural
beauty and wax lyrical about visiting the

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,430
river.

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,560
Beach runs on sweltering summer days,

66
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,150
but from the get go it was a darker side
to this new city over at the nuclear

67
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,730
plants or 40 is were quietly installing.

68
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Rbmk reaction is famous back then for
that ability to be converted to nuclear

69
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,470
weapon production at the drop of a hat.

70
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,770
This useful ability also made them
incredibly unstable like driving a car

71
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,920
without breaks in only a short time.

72
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:09,070
The reactor to prep it was going
to go screaming over a cliff edge,

73
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,620
taking his passengers right along with it.

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,180
On the eve of the disaster though,

75
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,890
everything seems to be going well,

76
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,843
just fine.

77
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,470
Officially given city status in 1979,

78
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,560
prep has grown into a booming metropolis,

79
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,560
a 43,000 people with an
average age of only 26.

80
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,280
The young population meant no
shortage of weddings and celebrations,

81
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,050
and the town had become a hugely desirable
posting for Soviet scientists over

82
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:36,520
the Vladimir Lenin nuclear ponds for as
well already up and running with a fifth

83
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,720
one on the way form of private residence
later cooled those last days a kind of

84
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,554
paradise.

85
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,550
If that was the case,

86
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,130
it was about to be one
that was lost forever.

87
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,980
One of the greatest ironies of the should
enable disaster is that it was caused

88
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,590
by of all things safety test.

89
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,420
On the night of April the 25th,

90
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:00,781
19,

91
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:01,830
86 engineers,

92
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,570
untrained in nuclear physics,

93
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,960
decided to find out if the newly
built react to number four good.

94
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,950
Still operated some emergency water
pumps in case of a power failure,

95
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,950
so they disconnected it
from all the fail safes,

96
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,580
removed the control rods and
shut off the main power source.

97
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,690
There was always a edge that almost
immediately ran out of control in a panic.

98
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:25,780
The engineers tried to reinstate all 200
control rods back into the reactor at

99
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,280
once.

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,220
This turned out to be a really bad idea.

101
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,510
The control Rod said graphite tips that
facilitated the unstable reactions that

102
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:37,920
were already taking place no sooner
were they in the reactive and it was hit

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,560
with the mother of all explosions.

104
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,020
The 1,200 ton cover,

105
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,360
it was blasted into the APP.

106
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,010
Radioactive debris shot a kilometer
into the night sky to workers in that

107
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:50,551
control room.

108
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,930
We'll just killed immediately.

109
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,741
Incredibly.

110
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:56,900
This survivors of the plans had no
idea that just triggered a bonafide

111
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,330
catastrophe there.

112
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,980
Geiger counters what good up to detect,

113
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,740
low amounts of radiation exposure,

114
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:05,580
the sort of thing you might normally
expect from working at a nuclear plant.

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,330
When the reactive spewed forth some of
the highest radiation levels ever seen,

116
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:13,260
the geiger counters just stopped
working back in prep apps.

117
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:16,040
The local fire brigade
mobilized nearly 30 minutes,

118
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,670
screamed up to the reactor in their
trucks with no protective clothing on and

119
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,300
pour water onto the fire.

120
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,230
That was raging,

121
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,213
but the flames,

122
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,910
they wouldn't go out and not only that,

123
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,740
the men complains of a metallic taste
on their tongues and the feeling of pins

124
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,410
and needles in that faces
by the time they got home.

125
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,760
At the end of that shifts,

126
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:37,260
a number of these first responders were
already showing signs of acute radiation

127
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,094
sickness,

128
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,440
yet still no emergency was declared.

129
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,990
When news reached Moscow
at 5:00 AM Soviet leader,

130
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,170
Gorbachev was infamously told
that the reaction was so safe,

131
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,510
it could be placed in
the middle of Red Square,

132
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,020
had Gorbachev taken them up on that
offer would have been a heck of a site.

133
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,660
The ruins of reactor number four,

134
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,670
where at this point buried under 14 tons
of highly rubble and burning it 3000

135
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:00,920
degrees.

136
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,240
It was also spewing radiation over
north Ukraine and southern better reuse,

137
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,730
plenty of which was already
finding its way to Pripyat.

138
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Is it been a hot night that night and
prevents many slept with that window's

139
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,300
open,

140
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,340
unaware the cancer causing particles
when are blowing into their bedrooms and

141
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,170
saturating on they're exhausted bodies.

142
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,100
Yet when we woke up,

143
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,730
it wasn't too warranted.

144
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,880
Mass panic to an ordinary day.

145
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,511
Yes,

146
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,260
most of these people were nuclear plants
workers and most new something has

147
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:27,681
happened,

148
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:30,530
but no one knew the full
extent of the disaster.

149
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,710
As radiation fell and
invisible deadly clouds.

150
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,600
Children played outside in the streets.

151
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:38,360
Mothers went shopping and
men got ready for work.

152
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,010
The one discordant note was the sudden
appearance of mosque soldiers on the city

153
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,610
streets.

154
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,010
They stood in twos or threes,

155
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,750
monitoring the crowds and
not answering questions.

156
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,580
It was the first sign the residents of
prep outside of the nuclear tsunami that

157
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:56,870
was about to engulf them
all by the evening of April
26 radiation levels in prep

158
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:00,320
out west 600,000 times the normal,

159
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,490
the excellent documentary,

160
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,370
the basket which neighbor,

161
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,850
which by the way is one of the
main sources for the section,

162
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,320
estimated that anyone exposed to those
levels would have received a lethal dose

163
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,640
interest for days.

164
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,510
Clearly the Soviet authorities
were going to have to react fast.

165
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,510
A tpm on April the 27th
with the deadly fire,

166
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:19,280
still burning three kilometers away,

167
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,690
a thousand school buses were driven
into prep and parked on every street

168
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,500
residence were gone outside and told they
had two hours to pack their belongings

169
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,290
and prepared to be evacuated.

170
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,590
There's been an accident.

171
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,310
They said,

172
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,881
don't worry,

173
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,030
you'll be away for three days
and we'll sort this all out,

174
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,500
and then you can come right back.

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,100
I mean,

176
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,930
come on with the Soviet authorities,

177
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
we lie to you so that's residents
prepared to leave their paradise.

178
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,300
They packed quickly,

179
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,130
taking only what they could carry.

180
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Then all 43,000 when loaded onto the
buses and driven away in the vast flat

181
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,570
emptiness of northern Ukraine.

182
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,200
None of these people would
ever see that homes again.

183
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,090
So now you might be wondering,

184
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:05,241
well,

185
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:09,530
what was going on in Moscow while
this nuclear apocalypse was unfolding?

186
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,100
Well,

187
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,320
the answer is nothing.

188
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:12,890
Well,

189
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,910
at least not much.

190
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,420
The credit then did put a scientific
delegation together to study the problem,

191
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:18,380
but aside from that,

192
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Soviet authorities basically sat on
my hands like a kid who's faster,

193
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,880
just a party and tried not to let
the rest of the big countries see him

194
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,743
blushing.

195
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,471
Unfortunately,

196
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:28,760
the radioactive fought,

197
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,000
or at least by Chernobyl,

198
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,760
was just like a regular fat
in one important respect,

199
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,030
it stank and also in the
eggs and then kind of way,

200
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:42,530
but the stench of radiation
which is capable of being
picked up by even the most

201
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,610
basic of equipment.

202
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,480
On April the 28th Swedish scientists
monitoring their own nuclear plants caught

203
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:50,540
the first whiff of that silence and very,

204
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,140
very deadly emission with only what
we can imagine was a figurative.

205
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,120
They all turns do the
other countries and said,

206
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:57,721
hey guys,

207
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,340
guess what the US is lodges did.

208
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,911
Now will they?

209
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:03,330
Moscow would try the
geopolitical equivalence of
whoever smells at Delta for the

210
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,350
next 24 hours.

211
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,670
The jig and it was up on April the 29th.

212
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,970
The Kremlin came clean.

213
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,983
From this point on,

214
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,540
I became a global emergency.

215
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,460
It was around this point that the
first responders arrived in Moscow,

216
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:16,590
is hospital number six,

217
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:21,390
the one place in the whole of the Soviet
Union get up to treat acute radiation,

218
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,100
sickness of the he also farm,

219
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,810
and he would responded that night,

220
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,790
28 would die in agony,

221
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,820
fair skin bund from that boons by an
invisible enemy in the aftermath of the

222
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,270
first responders,

223
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,320
deaths and additional a hundred 30,000
people were evacuated from the towns and

224
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,750
villages surrounding prep apps.

225
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,631
Yet even now,

226
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:43,670
these Soviet authorities response
remains woefully lacks in Kiev.

227
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,790
A mayday parade was held with the
blessing of the Communist Party despite a

228
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,840
change in wind direction,

229
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:53,010
meaning radioactive dust was now fooling
on the Ukrainian capital like a deadly

230
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,440
reign one week off to the initial blast,

231
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,280
the meltdown.

232
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,450
It was still going on.

233
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,810
The fire itself had
been put out with sends,

234
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,070
but the reacts to it continued to burn.

235
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,731
Meanwhile,

236
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:06,360
dangerous readings were coming in from
his phone away is Greece and France.

237
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,800
It was against this worrying backdrop
that the International Atomic Energy

238
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,070
Agency made is most worrying announcement
default with the reactor melting

239
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,900
downwards through the Pons trenoble.

240
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,620
It was on the brink of a full
blown nuclear explosion time,

241
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,493
real quick explainer,

242
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,100
the water,

243
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,880
the first now dead firemen
had dumped into the reactor,

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,390
had pooled at the bottom with
a top of the destroyed reactor,

245
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,610
now plugged with sand to contain the fire.

246
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,050
Any molten radioactive goo that
reached the water could trigger a chain

247
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:34,531
reaction,

248
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:37,440
which in turn could trigger
a nuclear explosion,

249
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,440
and we're talking about something
in the range of three megatons yeah,

250
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,030
that's 200 times the size of the bomb
that fattened Hiroshima according to the

251
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:46,880
utterly terrifying online tool,

252
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,640
new comap.

253
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,470
Depending on the way the wind was blowing,

254
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,440
this could have doubts,

255
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,370
not just Minsk,

256
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,950
but also Vilnius,

257
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,300
all the way in Lithuania with catastrophic
levels of radiation where the wind's

258
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,021
blowing toward us.

259
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:58,530
Kiev,

260
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,090
95 kilometers to the south,

261
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,720
it could have turned the Ukrainian
capital into a silent tuner.

262
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,510
It was at this point that the liquidators
arrived in the last years of the USSR.

263
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,940
The liquidators were the equivalent
of nine slash 11 first responders,

264
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,660
the men and women who were marched into
the jaws of death determined to do that

265
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:16,380
duty.

266
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,090
They comprised army reservists,

267
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:18,570
firemen,

268
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,021
nurses,

269
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:19,771
police officers,

270
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:20,910
miners and pilots,

271
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,280
plus the scientists and
workers who accompanied them.

272
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,160
They came from every single
one of the Soviet republics,

273
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,870
from Estonia to Georgia,

274
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,010
from Kazakhstan to as Pakistan old,

275
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:30,480
old,

276
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,130
half a million of them
converged on Chernobyl during
the dark days of mid 1986.

277
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,560
Very few of them escaped on Scott.

278
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,880
To read this story is to read a
tale of heroism and suffering,

279
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,390
not seen since the siege of Stalin Grad.

280
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,850
There are the 600 pilots who
flew over the burning reactive,

281
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,440
dropping lead on it to
plug the broken top.

282
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,680
Latest suffered myriad health problems.

283
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,400
There are 125 five and sent beneath the
meltdowns and drain the water out and

284
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,900
stop the second explosion,

285
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,710
most of whom got sick and then there are
the 10,000 miners who came from Russia

286
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,670
to create a concrete chamber beneath
the reactor to stop it poisoning the

287
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:07,504
groundwater.

288
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,510
Two thousand 500 of which would die before
the age of 40 that were then ordered

289
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:16,060
to clear radioactive debris from the
roof of the power plants were radiation

290
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,600
levels were so high they
have to work in 40 seconds.

291
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,950
Shifts or risk receiving a fatal dose.

292
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,480
Miners were forced to dig in 24 hours
shifts without any protective clothing.

293
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,080
Then there are all the stories of the
cleanup decontamination at the sign

294
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,710
itself.

295
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,320
The countryside surrounding
Pripyat was so contaminated.

296
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,270
Entire forest tent to be bulldozed,

297
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,390
buried villages were
scrubbed from tip to toe,

298
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,320
perhaps most shockingly special squads
were given guns and sent out into the

299
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,590
countryside to shoot all
the dogs and cats less.

300
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:47,190
They're radioactive now prove
a danger to humans all told.

301
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,870
It was one of the biggest clean
operations in human history,

302
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,940
rivaling even deepwater horizon.

303
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,380
It lasted six months,

304
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,610
whereupon a 30 mile exclusion zone was
established around prep apps and it

305
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,500
remains there to this very day.

306
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,110
The final capstone was the sarcophagus.

307
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,950
This was a concrete Bam off.

308
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,210
It was placed over the reactor
at the very end of 1986,

309
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,320
just as the first snows began to fall.

310
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,480
It seals reacts number four off from the
outside world completely ensuring that

311
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:17,410
it would remain safe at least for
a time you see the sarcophagus.

312
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:21,220
It was built in a hurry and there
was designed to only last 30 years.

313
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,820
This wasn't seen as a problem is
when 2016 finally rolled around.

314
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:28,180
The Soviet authorities would clearly
still be in charge and Ukraine and that'd

315
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,500
be able to replace it with another one.

316
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,070
I mean,

317
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,520
it's not like the entire
Ussr always gonna compete.

318
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,630
You collapsed in the
next half decade or so,

319
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,703
right

320
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,281
on November the ninth,

321
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:42,580
19,

322
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,031
89.

323
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,290
The world watched in horror as ordinary
Germans toppled great chunks of the

324
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:47,291
Berlin Wall.

325
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:47,890
Well,

326
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,610
God swatched on it was the start of
the complete collapse of communism in

327
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:55,780
Eastern Europe and the final
dissolution of the USSR in Ukraine,

328
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,680
mass protests against Moscow
didn't break out until 1991,

329
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,610
but when they did,

330
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,650
they did so under trend nobles,

331
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,360
deadly cloud in Kiev,

332
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,790
protesters were photographed in gas masks.

333
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,600
And protective clothing waving signs
referencing the disaster at a political

334
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:10,931
level.

335
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:15,580
The shutting out of Ukrainians from a
disaster in their own backyard had immense

336
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,414
consequences,

337
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,040
the most immediate of which was key ever
declaring independence on August 24th

338
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:21,820
that year,

339
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,930
but the fallout from Chernobyl
had effects fall beyond Ukraine.

340
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,380
The Economist has argued that the huge
economic hits the USSR took from the

341
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,710
disaster directly lead to its collapse,

342
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,470
but on the fringes of the
Chernobyl exclusion zone,

343
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:39,640
former residents of prep had watched
these events with undoubtedly mixed

344
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,560
feelings while their homes had been lost,

345
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:45,070
the authorities that built them a
new city to recreate that paradise.

346
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,530
Many of them still worked at
the old power powerplan's.

347
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,431
Remarkably,

348
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:51,860
the three other reactors had been
restarted by the end of 1986.

349
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,761
Apparently,

350
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:56,810
danger be damned yet new cities
can't make up for the toll.

351
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,200
Trenoble took on its
liquidators across the USSR.

352
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:04,100
Hospitals had spent the last five years
flooded with those who worked in the

353
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,000
zone today.

354
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:09,320
It's estimated that around a third of
the surviving liquidators are disabled in

355
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:10,880
some way in Bela Reuss,

356
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:12,710
which got more radiation than Ukraine.

357
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,180
One study estimated that as many as 20
percent of the adolescent population

358
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,670
suffered birth defects
related to the accident,

359
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,910
as for the number of excess
cancer deaths Chernobyl caused,

360
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:26,870
we simply don't know the World Health
Organization estimated on the 20th

361
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:28,940
anniversary that it was around 4,000,

362
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,010
but estimates vary wildly.

363
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,030
One of you report,

364
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,250
but the number closer to $60,000,

365
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,413
whatever the truth,

366
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,300
the aftermath of Chernobyl has been a
source of anger in Ukraine and better

367
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:41,420
batteries ever since when the plants,

368
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,780
other reactors were finally shut down
and following international pressure in

369
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:49,781
2001 few lamented that passing the
drama when it wasn't over in the late 19

370
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:51,471
nineties,

371
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:55,100
it became clear that Ukraine was never
going to be capable of rebuilding the

372
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:55,700
sarcophagus.

373
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,780
When it finally failed,

374
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,470
it was at this point that it became
abundantly clear that the sarcophagus was

375
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,960
never going to make us until 2016,

376
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,970
despite being built to last 30 years.

377
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:08,090
The Soviet sarcophagus was
already on the brink of collapse.

378
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,320
The next 10 years alone were spent
shoring up the old structure to prevent

379
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,250
another catastrophe.

380
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,880
Then in the mid two thousands and new
song called Fergus had to be built that

381
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,770
would completely contained the old
one at a staggering 35,000 tons.

382
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:22,640
The new sarcophagus,

383
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,230
it was a miracle of engineering,

384
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,520
builds 300 meters away from react to
number four to limit radiation exposure.

385
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,560
It took 10 years to assemble.

386
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,370
It then had to be rolled over the old
sarcophagus and completely sealed.

387
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,630
It was taller than the statue of liberty
and bigger than an Olympic stadium when

388
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,180
it was finally sealed in November of 2016,

389
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,760
and it cost one point $5,000,000,000.

390
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,810
This one though,

391
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,310
it's expected to last the next one,

392
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,144
hundred years.

393
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,980
During that time,

394
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,850
robots inside.

395
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,300
We'll deconstruct the old sarcophagus
before finally dismantling and making the

396
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:54,530
reactor itself safe.

397
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,110
When the new sarcophagus
finally reaches his end in 2116,

398
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,060
it's hoped humanity,

399
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,970
we need to build an even bigger one today.

400
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:03,350
The glistening new structure,

401
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,520
it looks over a landscape that's
very different from the one reacted.

402
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:06,981
Number four,

403
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:07,880
changed forever.

404
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:08,990
In 1986,

405
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,360
the x paradise of prep that is no longer
just empty this crumbling away beneath

406
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:14,780
and on sort of nature,

407
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,160
the ones team forest,

408
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:20,270
so now so devoid of people that the
exclusion zone has become an accidental

409
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,170
wildlife reserve.

410
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,160
Teaming with wolves,

411
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:22,640
bears,

412
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,370
beavers,

413
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,203
and links,

414
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,260
not the people that have
completely vanished though
just a few short years ago,

415
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:31,190
the Ukrainian government agreed to let a
small number of Chernobyl evacuees back

416
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,630
in around $200.

417
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:32,830
Now,

418
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,190
if within the zone itself,

419
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,890
dicing with death on a daily basis,

420
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,680
you can even go to visit them tonight.

421
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:42,800
We'll receives tens of thousands of
tourists a year drawn by the allure of

422
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,570
Ukraine's,

423
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,570
very own pompei and I actually went to
did this last year and it's well worth

424
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,440
doing as for the disaster itself.

425
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:49,860
Well,

426
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,490
thankfully it remains the worst
nuclear accidents on record that as the

427
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:55,830
Fukushima meltdown in 2011 was,

428
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:59,310
it didn't even come
close to 1986 eruption.

429
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,280
Hopefully neither accident
will ever be exceeded.

430
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:02,671
Now,

431
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:06,360
normally this is the point where we
wrap up a biography and say a few pithy

432
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,340
things and just that those credits roll,

433
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:11,320
but Chernobyl story when
it's still far from Ovid,

434
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,270
it's estimated that the zone will remain
uninhabitable for humans for another

435
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,650
24,000 years,

436
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,680
a stretch of time that's
almost beyond comprehension.

437
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,510
It was only four and a half thousand
years ago that the pyramids were first

438
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,383
built in Egypt.

439
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
Try to imagine for a moment just
how different life was back then,

440
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,860
how impossible it would have been for
your average slave to close his eyes and

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,220
imagine our orwell's to
imagine spaceflight penicillin,

442
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,750
the outs now,

443
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,600
multiply that feeling by a factor of six.

444
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,730
You'd have some idea of the scale of
time left until Chernobyl's affects.

445
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,900
Stop being felt.

446
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,370
I'll story today.

447
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,451
It might be over,

448
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,840
but the tale of Chernobyl is
only just getting started,

449
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,660
so I hope you found this video interesting
and there's a little bit different to

450
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,530
our normal stuff,

451
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:59,160
but we thought we'd try a biography
of a place just for a change of pace.

452
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,850
I found this one personally super
interesting and if you did like it,

453
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,530
please do give us a thumbs up below.

454
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:07,380
Let us know in the comments what you think
of doing this sort of video every now

455
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,960
and again would love to
hear from you and as always,

456
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,790
thank you for watching.
