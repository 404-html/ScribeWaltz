1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,341
Hey,

2
00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:01,840
just before we get cracking
with today's video,

3
00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:04,300
I got to say there's a lot of
Russian pronunciations in here.

4
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:06,670
I am looking them up when I can,

5
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:08,620
but I don't always get them
a hundred percent right.

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,870
I apologize ahead of time if
you want to have a go at me.

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,351
Well,

8
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:12,610
that's what the comments are for.

9
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,120
Right.

10
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,421
Okay.

11
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,254
Let's crack on.

12
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,820
During the Bolshevik revolution,

13
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:20,590
the Romanov Dynasty was killed off
to over a 100 year reign of Russia.

14
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,820
The bodies of the parents and all five
children were laid out on the grounds,

15
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,970
but when the corpses were later
moved and given a proper burial,

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,080
the bodies of the sun,

17
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,540
Alexi and the Princess Anastasia,

18
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,590
we're missing this,

19
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:36,040
gave the Russian people hope that at
least two of these innocent children

20
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,070
managed to play dead long
enough in order to escape.

21
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,120
Several years later,

22
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:43,060
a young woman was admitted to
a mental hospital in Germany.

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,930
There were skulls all over her body
and she clearly suffered some traumatic

24
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,351
events,

25
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,900
but her mind to block
out the painful memories.

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,420
She couldn't even remember her name.

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,080
The only clue about where she came
from was the fact that she spoke with a

28
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,130
Russian accent.

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,210
Months later,

30
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,410
a Russian patient was admitted to that
same hospital and she immediately began

31
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:04,210
to kneel in front of this young girl.

32
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,740
She claims that she recognized her
as the missing Princess Anastasia,

33
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,480
but who was this young woman?

34
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:14,530
Was she really the long lost princess
or would this go down as one of the

35
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:16,450
biggest frauds in all of history?

36
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,750
Anastasia Romanov was born in 19.

37
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:30,881
Oh,

38
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:31,081
one,

39
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,831
two saw Nicholas.

40
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:32,401
The second one,

41
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,480
his wife saw rina,

42
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,630
Alexandra theater,

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,430
rovner.

44
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,880
I propertycapsule it
was grand duchess best.

45
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,670
No one ever addressed the young girl
with this proper title in her daily life.

46
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,960
She had three older sisters,

47
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,261
Olga,

48
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:43,651
Maria,

49
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:44,484
and Tatiana.

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,181
Her younger brother,

51
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,850
Alexia was meant to ascend
to the throne someday.

52
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,600
The Romanov children were the first royals
to have such an extensive collection

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,070
of family photographs.

54
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,120
There are hundreds of pictures and
videos of their family vacations and them

55
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,950
playing games on the palace grounds.

56
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,890
It was easy to see that
they live a carefree life.

57
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,940
Their pictures were publicized all over
Russia and they became the darlings of

58
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:06,610
the country.

59
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,680
Anastasia was an extremely energetic
toddler who had a bubbly personality.

60
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,910
She was very intelligent,

61
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,430
so she grew bored of our
tutors lessons very quickly.

62
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,080
She was a tomboy and she enjoyed playing
outside far more than doing ladylike

63
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,460
activities with her sisters.

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,840
She was described as clumsy and was
always climbing on something or running

65
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:25,710
around somewhere.

66
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,820
She seemed to have an endless amounts of
energy according to some of our cousins

67
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:34,170
and ladies in waiting Anastasia's board
and manifested in some terrible ways.

68
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,410
She would entertain herself by playing
pranks on people and to our cousins

69
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,340
called evil.

70
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,830
In one of the servants'
quarter a terrorist,

71
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,520
she tripped on a servants in the hallway,

72
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,500
climbed up trees,

73
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:46,830
and refused to come down and
hit rocks inside of snowballs.

74
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,790
She would often cheat during games and
she lied a lot to get herself out of

75
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,360
trouble.

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,050
At one sign,

77
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,680
a monk named gregory rest.

78
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,120
Pinkston became the spiritual
advisor of the Romanov family.

79
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,551
Sorry,

80
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,321
Inner Alexandra.

81
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:01,910
I whole heartedly that he had
magical powers that heals,

82
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,421
had a son,

83
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:02,921
Alexi,

84
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,400
who was suffering from
hemophilia respiration,

85
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,980
was able to heal him from the
brink of death because of this,

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,730
she listened to his advice and gave
him free rein in the royal palace,

87
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,511
Anastasia,

88
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,460
that may or may not have realized it,

89
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,510
but her father Nicholas had a problem
with drugs and one of his diary entries he

90
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,560
wrote about waking up with a stuffy
nose and planning to fix it by snorting

91
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,340
cocaine.

92
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,761
Back then,

93
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,520
the cocaine was actually prescribed
by doctors as medications,

94
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,670
so it didn't hold the same
stigma that it does today.

95
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,710
While she did not take recreational drugs.

96
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:33,860
So arena Alexandra,

97
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,850
it was described as being
anxious and high strung.

98
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,230
Anastasia commented that her mother
barely ever indulged in coffee or wine

99
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,490
because she had a bad stomach.

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,540
She was also incredibly spiritual and
often went to mistakes to help make

101
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,490
decisions about day to day life.

102
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,220
Rasputin was also pretty
famous for using morphine,

103
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,821
cocaine,

104
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,830
and opium on a regular basis.

105
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,700
Some historians believe that the
closer he got to the SAR and Sarina,

106
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,770
the more the couple became dependent on
the drugs and guidance of the fanatical

107
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:06,880
religion that Rasputin was introducing
them to after witnessing the terrible

108
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,250
things that drugs did to
the adults in her life.

109
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:13,270
Anastasia became obsessed with
clean eating and natural remedies.

110
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,120
She spoke against drug use
and became a vegetarian.

111
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,440
Every time she was sick,

112
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,400
she would throw a fit,

113
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,060
refusing to take any medication because
she didn't want to be like Rasputin into

114
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,860
father.

115
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,240
Sevens noted that Rasputin was given a
little too much access to the children in

116
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:28,901
1910.

117
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,500
One of the Nannies was particularly
disturbed about the fact that the monk was

118
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,890
often witnessed with four girls
when they were in their nightgowns.

119
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,310
He had the freedom to enter the
children's nursery whenever he wanted.

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,271
That same year.

121
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,570
One of the other governesses
claims that Rasputin raped her.

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
She tried to tell the Sarina,

123
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,210
but sadly the Sarina was so brainwashed
by recipes in that she refused to

124
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,220
believe the government asked the girls.

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,240
They were growing older.

126
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,890
The eldest daughters were
already teenagers and
Anastasia was nine years old.

127
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,150
One of the other servants
believed the governor,

128
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:00,340
the story about the rape,

129
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,310
the parents of the children who have
flaunting preoccupied with their own

130
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:03,701
issues,

131
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,060
so this only trying to keep
[inaudible] away from the children.

132
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,990
The girls were very naive and did not
see any issue with him coming to visit

133
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:11,770
them at night.

134
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,450
They called him a friends and when they
told Sardina Alexandra that the nanny

135
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,580
was trying to keep them out
of the nursery at night.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,690
She was fired according to the
children in was simply visiting,

137
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:27,070
do tell them bedtime stories and help
them say that press back in his hometown,

138
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,230
Ras and actually did
have children of his own,

139
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,260
so it's always possible that he
was acting on fatherly instinct,

140
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,940
but its reputation of being a sexual
deviance would be enough for anyone to be

141
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:37,720
worried.

142
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,810
After the nanny was fired,

143
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:41,260
she told everyone she
knew about the story.

144
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,370
This box of remit,

145
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:46,090
that respite and had free reign to visit
the princesses at night in a sexual

146
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,720
way.

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,410
There is no evidence that rescues and
ever actually abused the Romanov children,

148
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,130
but of course we'll never really know
what happens behind closed doors.

149
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,641
However,

150
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:58,150
it was around this time that saw Nicholas
ordered Rasputin to leave some in

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
Petersburg when world war one first began.

152
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,630
Anastasia was only 13 years old.

153
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,500
Her mother and sisters were old enough
to volunteer as nurses for the Red Cross.

154
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,950
She did her duty by playing pool and
chest with the soldiers and entertained

155
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,910
people with our wild energy
and Loftin as a teenager.

156
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,350
Anastasia used her acting talents for
good though what seems like mean spirited.

157
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:22,370
Pranks that she played in her childhood
actually ended up being loved comedy.

158
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,240
Her family and members of the staff
would often put on their own plays and

159
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,020
performances.

160
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,950
According to witnesses,

161
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,610
Anastasia was naturally hilarious and
did everyone laughing so hard that they

162
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,690
had peers in their eyes.

163
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,680
Sometimes she would burst out funny faces
when the camera was trying to capture

164
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:40,430
a candid moment of her sisters
in every difficult situation.

165
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,570
Anastasia was always the one to fix
it and always the one to make everyone

166
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,560
around us smile.

167
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,221
Now,

168
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:46,970
after the war,

169
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,640
Russia began suffering
a terrible depression.

170
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,750
People were starving,

171
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:54,170
men had died during the war and
people desperately needed help.

172
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,770
Many people viewed the royal family
as being part of the problem,

173
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,550
their reputation for bad decision making
with Rasputin session that he didn't

174
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,384
tell Eva,

175
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,230
and basically the short of it is the
communism took hold by the time Anastasia

176
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:06,441
10,

177
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:06,921
16,

178
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:09,890
the Romanov family was placed under
house arrest by the Bolsheviks.

179
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,800
The criminal family were ordered to leave.

180
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,990
Their costs were put under house arrest.

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,730
They will move from place to place,

182
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,760
and their last residence was
a place called Patty of house.

183
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,290
Even in these dark moments,

184
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,440
Anastasia was still trying to
make everyone laugh and smile.

185
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,190
It was noted that she adjusted the
best to that new life of captivity.

186
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,030
One of the guards told a story of
Anastasia trying to open a window for some

187
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:41,630
fresh air and they shot at her to
keep her from trying to escape.

188
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,620
She turned to the guard and stuck her
tongue out Sam's window shut and walked

189
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:46,400
away.

190
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,470
Even in this awful situation for her,

191
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,340
she was fearless at first.

192
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:50,940
Lennon wrote,

193
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,290
the family was in captivity and
promised that they were still alive.

194
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,861
However,

195
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:58,100
he soon realized that as long as
the role deadlines still existed,

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,820
that would always be a chance
that soldiers loyal to the Roman,

197
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,240
obviously we'll try to overthrow him.

198
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,160
He decided that the only way for communism
to exist was to execute the entire

199
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,850
family.

200
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,850
The family was made to walk down to
the basement where a group of men were

201
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,050
ordered to shoot at them.

202
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,380
During the execution,

203
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,060
the gunman realized that the daughters
were still alive even after being shot

204
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,440
multiple times in the chest.

205
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,030
It turns out they were wearing corsets
that had been lined with Raul gemstones

206
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,980
and this acted like a bulletproof vest.

207
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,940
After this,

208
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,480
each of the family members received a
shot to the head to ensure that they

209
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:30,500
actually did die.

210
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,220
However,

211
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,130
some believe that these gen line course,

212
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,440
it would've been enough for the gunmen
to hesitate to kill the two youngest

213
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,370
members of the family.

214
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,151
At this point,

215
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,160
it's all of the older daughters
were full grown women,

216
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,910
but Anastasia and Alexa were
only 13 and 16 years old.

217
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,270
They weren't innocent children
and they didn't deserve to die.

218
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,820
Many people hopes that the
gods took pity on them.

219
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,620
One of the men in the firing squad,

220
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:52,280
Rudolph Laka,

221
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,730
was originally from Austria and he was
staying in as a prisoner of war as a

222
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,210
foreigner.

223
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,450
He had no loyalty to the imperial
family and was ordered to serve the

224
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,230
bolsheviks.

225
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,230
He claimed that he pulled over the
truck when I got stuck in the mud,

226
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,500
he could hear a rustling in the back
and when he went to check on the bodies,

227
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,600
he discovered that
Anastasia was still alive,

228
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,040
I think helped her escape.

229
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,521
However,

230
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:15,360
there were other quotes from her that
indicated the total opposite was true.

231
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,390
He was one square to to saying that he
didn't care about killing the Romanov

232
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:18,960
family.

233
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,050
They weren't relatives of his and he
was doing his duty for the Bolsheviks,

234
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,950
but this confession was enough to spawn
remiss that Anastasia had actually

235
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:26,784
escaped.

236
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,201
In 19,

237
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:33,680
20,

238
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,940
a young woman in Berlin,

239
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,400
Germany attempted to jump off a
bridge and commit suicide nearby.

240
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Police officers saved her life and
brought her to a mental hospital for

241
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:42,020
treatments.

242
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,780
She was beautiful and spoke
with a thick Russian accent.

243
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,670
When the doctors disaster who she was,

244
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:50,150
she replied that she didn't know
there were scars all over our body,

245
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:54,530
including a triangle shaped indentation
in how foot and deep lacerations on her

246
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:55,280
back.

247
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,660
It was clear that she had survived
some sort of horrific trauma and brain

248
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,860
completely shut down.

249
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,890
Every night she would wake up
screaming to her nightmares,

250
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,521
the memories.

251
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,790
They were simply too painful for
her to recall when she was awake,

252
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,590
but at night they seem to come to her.

253
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,220
The doctors gave her the nickname of miss.

254
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,063
Unknown.

255
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,143
Two years later,

256
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,781
this unknown,

257
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,110
we're still living in a mental hospital
in Germany when it Russian women was

258
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,490
admitted as a patient.

259
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,660
The woman was shocked and immediately
kneels in front of the young women.

260
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,550
She said that this was the
missing princess on a stage up.

261
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,540
Ms Dot unknown did not
confirm or deny the statement.

262
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,130
She had no idea who she actually
wasn't becoming a princess.

263
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,340
Sounded pretty fine to her.

264
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,240
So the doctor has.

265
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,010
This actually needs a lot of sense though.

266
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,180
Ms Dot unknown had clearly
endured something horrific
and it was the answer to a

267
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:41,751
mystery.

268
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,370
They had long been trying to solve,

269
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,940
comparing photos of both misson known
and Anastasia next to one another.

270
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,030
It is easy to see why many
people believe this to be true.

271
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,811
They have the same.

272
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:52,430
His nose and dies.

273
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,590
Ms Dot unknown was also the same age.

274
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,150
In 1922 newspapers began to claim that
the princess had been found and her photo

275
00:10:59,151 --> 00:10:59,960
was published.

276
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,060
Friends and family of the Roman.

277
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,140
This came from all over
the world to visit her.

278
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,870
They would ask her questions
that only Anastasia would know,

279
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:10,040
and yet somehow this woman knew many of
the answers the opinion of friends and

280
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,120
family was divided.

281
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:11,810
Fifty slash 50.

282
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,400
While the case was under investigation,

283
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:17,450
she was invited to stay in castles with
Rehmann off cousins and several people

284
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:21,380
to send money to her to help her pay
for our expenses and is tier to Sydney.

285
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,990
Gibbs was one of the
most outspoken critics,

286
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:26,960
though he vividly remembered
his student's personality,

287
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,760
no matter how much they look the same.

288
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:31,880
This woman liked Anastasia's
whips onto a sense of humor.

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,950
Another tutor pr guerrilla agreed.

290
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:35,870
They found the tree princess first.

291
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,471
However,

292
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,240
once he spent more time around this woman,

293
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,340
he agreed that they were
not the same person.

294
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,830
She was soft spoken and ladylike,

295
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,710
but relatives who only saw her
when she was on her best behavior.

296
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,430
It was easy to imagine that
she could be Anastasia,

297
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,020
but for people who knew
what she was really like,

298
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,120
this was an entirely different passenger.

299
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,860
The surviving members of the royal family
mess up to discuss whether or not this

300
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:00,280
woman deserve to receive the
inheritance of the seminal family.

301
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,851
In the end,

302
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:04,370
they came to a vote and decided that there
was not enough evidence to prove that

303
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,530
she was the real.

304
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,540
Anastasia has.

305
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,840
Supporters were shocked
because they really felt that
she was the true princess.

306
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,700
Grendel,

307
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,190
Xenia,

308
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,910
Alexandra [inaudible] sister of saw
Nicholas the second and Anastasia zones,

309
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,331
right.

310
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:20,020
That she was outraged by this decision
and that the remaining family was simply

311
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,690
just greedy for the friends
and family who believed to.

312
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,800
They felt very sorry for this disowned
princess and wanted to do whatever they

313
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,634
could to help out.

314
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,490
She lives a life of luxury
and she was given anything.

315
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,420
She could have a once.

316
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,300
She eventually moved to New
York with a woman named Annie,

317
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,260
but Jennings,

318
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,660
where she was able to live
in a gorgeous penthouse.

319
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,680
She changed the names.

320
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:39,610
You nrn doesn't.

321
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,620
She met a man named Jack Manhattan,

322
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,900
who was a history teacher
in Virginia that have doubt,

323
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,450
a very happy life together
in the United States.

324
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,550
Ms Dot Anderson went to a grave
claiming that she was grand,

325
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,050
was on a stage young

326
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,470
after the fall of the
Soviet Union in 1990.

327
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:02,410
One historian searched for the
bodies of the Romanov family.

328
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,220
After confirming their identity is
through DNA tests with surviving relatives

329
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,540
that were given a proper burial and the
son Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint

330
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,270
Petersburg and canonized a saint in 1998.

331
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,691
However,

332
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,660
the bodies of Alexi and under you,

333
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,360
we're missing this was enough
to further fuel the debate.

334
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,600
So now we have the question.

335
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,670
That of course is in your mind,

336
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:25,960
and that's whether Anna Anderson
was actually Anastasia off to rule.

337
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,550
This inspired several movies and plays
including the 1997 animated movie

338
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,470
Anastasia and 2007.

339
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,770
The bones of two human bodies were
found buried in the middle of the woods

340
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:36,910
inside area one,

341
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,830
it was a male and the female,

342
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,120
the bones showed signs of being doused
with acid and burned by fire as well.

343
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,320
It was finally confirmed through DNA
testing that these were the missing bodies

344
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,120
of anesthesia and Alexi.

345
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,310
According to records
and forensic evidence,

346
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:54,580
scientists and historians now believe
that the men who killed the Romanovs

347
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,080
attempted to burn the bodies,

348
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,680
but started off with the two
smallest Alexi under anesthesia.

349
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,740
They covered the bones in sulfuric
acid and then set them on fire.

350
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,530
When they discovered that this did
not completely destroy the evidence,

351
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:08,500
they decided to move along and it's
buried the rest of the body's elsewhere.

352
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,730
This is why the two children had been
separated from the rest of their family.

353
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,863
As for Anna Anderson,

354
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,810
she was dead years before the
truth of her identity was revealed.

355
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,210
It sounds out that she was
a Polish factory worker.

356
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,500
She was married and work
together with her husband.

357
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,760
One day a grenade was tossed
into the factory and exploded.

358
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,350
She had to witness the love of her life
and several coworkers dying around her

359
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,930
before receiving a severe
head injury I bought.

360
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,150
He was scarred from the
shrapnel of the explosion.

361
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,770
After recovering from her wounds,

362
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,790
she had no family,

363
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,080
no friends to help at home.

364
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,090
She somehow managed to make it to Germany,

365
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,500
which is where the police found her,

366
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,813
and as they say,

367
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,020
the rest is history.

368
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
After revealing the truth of our identity,

369
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,790
many people began to call and
around us and a fraud and Delilah.

370
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
She was able to live a life of total
luxury and many considered to simply be a

371
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,380
very skilled con women.

372
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:54,920
However,

373
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,040
it's very possible that in a mental
state she may have actually believed that

374
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,630
she was the real Anastasia.

375
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,720
Before she was discovered
in the mental hospital.

376
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,070
She was a young woman who
had nothing left to live for.

377
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,170
She was ready to take her own life,

378
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,080
but becoming.

379
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,990
Anastasia gave her an identity,

380
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,943
a purpose,

381
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,450
and a family who loved her,

382
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,960
for the people who desperately needed
to regain that faith in humanity.

383
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,890
They needed to believe the innocent
children had survived the slaughter in our

384
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:23,600
own way and around us and gave them a
reason to believe in miracles from what we

385
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,190
know about the real Anastasia.

386
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,270
She lived to make people smile if she
knew that her memory and even the mere

387
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:33,740
possibility of being alive brought so
much hope and joy to so many people,

388
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,140
she would surely have been proud.

389
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,660
So I really hope you found
that video interesting.
