1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,520
He is the epitome of pure,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,990
unadulterated evil.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,130
The mastermind gallery with the
swastika on his forehead and the wild,

4
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,540
crazy look in his eyes.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,220
He is responsible for one of the most
heinous crimes of all time controlling his

6
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,720
minions like puppeteer and
this week's biographics.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,720
We're looking into the dark and
disturbing story of Charles Manson.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,873
Okay.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,900
Charles Mills Manson was born on November
the 12th 1934 to 16 year old Kathleen

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,950
Maddox and the 24 year old tranzians
labor known only as Colonel Scott.

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,470
Kathleen was a promiscuous teenager
who drank tea margins and money to fuel

12
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,460
their habits by selling her body.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,720
The baby always known as new name Maddix
for the first few weeks of life until

14
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,460
his mother seemed to settle on Charlie.

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,690
He never knew his father.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,390
He cleared out as soon as he
heard the Kathleen was pregnant.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,710
Kathleen was too young,

18
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:03,730
too immature and unpredictable to
provide a stable environment for a young

19
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,300
child.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,810
She appeared to have new
maternal instincts and would
leave the trial to fend

21
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:11,320
for himself while she went off on
one of our vendors as an adult.

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,060
Charlie often related to that.

23
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:16,960
His mother was once in a cafe with him
on her knee when the waitress offered to

24
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,070
buy the baby from her.

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,090
Kathleen's asking price once a pitcher
of beer and having consumed it,

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,880
she's simply walked out and
left Charlie to the woman.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,931
According to Charlie,

28
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:29,500
has uncle took four days to
track him down and had him home.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,000
When Charlie was six years old,

30
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,480
his mother and uncle decided
to rob a gas station.

31
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,383
They were both caught,

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,930
convicted and sent for five years
to Moundsville state prison.

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,050
The boy was putting into the cat of
is strictly religious grandparents,

34
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:44,110
but after a few months he went to live
with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia.

35
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,960
The environment's was very
different to many things.

36
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,610
Shawnee had previously known his arms
on like his sister was regimens is and

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,220
disciplines.

38
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,290
She was also strictly religious.

39
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,340
Her husband's bell was even more for
heaven's in his faith and his wife,

40
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,630
a strict disciplinarian.

41
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,880
He considered jolly to be a sissy.

42
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,930
On the first day of school,

43
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:05,680
he said the boy to class in a dress
in order to teach him how to fight.

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,070
Charlie's seem to adapt it to this very
different kind of life and actually grew

45
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,140
to enjoy his new regimented routine.

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,900
The two years between six and eight would
prove to be some of the most stable of

47
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,680
his young life,

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,220
but then his mother was released from
prison and immediately took him back.

49
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,080
Kathleen was more unstable than ever.

50
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:24,610
She preferred a life of promiscuity
and alcohol abuse to baton all domestic

51
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,090
city,

52
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,480
constantly in trouble with the law
ends with no money for food and board.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,970
They constantly moved around the
Midwest or the age of nine trolley.

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,040
He dropped out of school.

55
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,300
The transient life that he was forced
to live shapes the type of boy that

56
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,140
Charlie would become.

57
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,220
He kept to himself living his
life through his imagination.

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,790
He was constantly watching,

59
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,740
taking things in and
dreaming of a future free of.

60
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,330
There's no hope.

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,960
Mother.

62
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,430
He also learns how to become
a very accomplished thief
as age nine Charlene was

63
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,470
caught stealing and sent to reform school.

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,330
Three years later he was caught again.

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,530
This time he was packed off to the Jib
old school for boys in Indiana before he

66
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,131
was taken away.

67
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,140
Kathleen promise to to visit him often.

68
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,190
Of course they,

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,970
she never did.

70
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,860
Just 10 months into his incarceration,

71
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,910
jolly escapes,

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,790
he robbed a grocery store to get
some money and went that run out.

73
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,980
He stole other things including a bicycle.

74
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,820
He got caught in the act of making off
with the bike and soon found himself back

75
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,654
and confinements.

76
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,390
This time he was sent to
Indiana juvenile center.

77
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,710
That's after just two days.

78
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,470
He stole some cutters and
it's free and not any himself.

79
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,080
There's 30 other boys
this time he escaped.

80
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,370
Young Fella installed motorbike bike,

81
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,420
but rather a car,

82
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,140
but the 13 year old could hardly see over
the steering wheel and was apprehended

83
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,370
within hours of his escape.

84
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,990
When he ended up in juvenile court,

85
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:36,280
he was surprised to see his mother.

86
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,390
His spirits were dashed.

87
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:37,781
However,

88
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,290
when she testified that she would not
take him out of the somewhat sympathetic

89
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,080
judge since Charlie to
Father Flanagan's boys town,

90
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,130
but the state here,

91
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,680
it was almost a short as
his last incarceration.

92
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,790
After just four days,

93
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,380
he ran off with another young offender,

94
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,280
Blackie Nelson.

95
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,100
They stole a car which
they subsequently crashed.

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,990
Still they made that weighs
in the hammock black.

97
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:56,591
He's uncle Lee,

98
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,730
World War II veteran,

99
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,630
and an underworld figure who gave the
young hoodlums free board and food in

100
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,980
exchange for the proceeds from armed
robberies that he happened commit during

101
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,030
that third robbery.

102
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,510
The two boys were caught this time at
Shawnee was sent to the Indiana school for

103
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,920
boys in Plainfield.

104
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,310
Yeah,

105
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,900
he stayed for three years.

106
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,440
Charlie would lead to claim that his
small statue led him to being constantly

107
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,370
raped and sodomized by other inmates
as well as by the school employees.

108
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,270
He also recalls that he was constantly
picked on by the gods who would

109
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,960
continually find fault with him beating
him with leather straps and toured and

110
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,794
clubs.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,833
Okay.

112
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,540
One night after being gang
raped by a group of older boys.

113
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,430
He beat one of his attack is do just
short of the point of death with an iron

114
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,080
bar as the boy lay sleeping.

115
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,350
Charlie then placed the iron bar under
the banner of one of the other attackers

116
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,540
successfully implicating
him in the attack.

117
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,350
Johnny was exhibiting a trait that
would characterize his personality as an

118
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,010
adult.

119
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,300
This was that he would hold his anger in
for a time only for it to explode later

120
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,980
in an orgy of violence.

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,200
Over the three years
he spent at Plainfield,

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,260
Charlie escapes no less than 18 times.

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,310
He was returned every time though
and in March of 1951 his sentence was

124
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:11,370
increased and he was sent it to
a minimum security institution.

125
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,240
This was the national training
school for boys in Washington DC.

126
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,870
Here things were very different to
what Charlie had known at Plainfield.

127
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,490
The facility was well run.

128
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:24,840
The boys were treated well and say genuine
focus was placed on rehabilitation.

129
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,070
Charlie liked at that,

130
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,620
but he had to no interest
in being rehabilitated.

131
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,603
He'd do his time,

132
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,330
but then it would get back out to the
life of crime that he knew was waiting for

133
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:33,840
him.

134
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,290
At around the age of 15 Charlene
was given a psychiatric assessments.

135
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,150
He was found to be aggressive,

136
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,170
antisocial and illiteracy.

137
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,150
The case worker reported that the boy
was severely emotionally traumatized and

138
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,550
in serious need of psychiatric treatments.

139
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,210
It was also noted that he has a
higher than normal aptitude for music.

140
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:51,691
Well,

141
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:55,320
I would say with the 24th of 1951 Charlie
was transferred to the national bridge

142
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,700
on a camp in Petersburg,

143
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,380
Virginia.

144
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,250
Three months later,

145
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,020
just weeks before his parole hearing,

146
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,410
he sodomized and other inmates while
holding a razor blade to his neck.

147
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,880
He was reclassified as extremely
dangerous and transfer to a tougher high

148
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,080
security facility.

149
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,570
The federal reformatory at Petersburg,

150
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,320
Virginia.

151
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,450
After seven months of
the federal reformatory,

152
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,630
Charlie had racks up
eight major violations.

153
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,210
He was classified as
defined the homosexual,

154
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,860
dangerous and safe only under
supervision with assaultive tendencies.

155
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,970
Towards the end of 1952 he was sentenced
to a higher security facility still.

156
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,650
That's at the surprise of everybody.

157
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,660
He transformed into a model prisoner.

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,380

162
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,160

He was given five years probation,

179
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,740
but when he failed to show
up to a subsequent hearing,

180
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,050

After being there a few months,

184
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,480
he was informed that his wife
was living with another man.

185
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,373
Two years later,

186
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,510
she obtained a decree after force.

187
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,350
In September of 1958 Charlie was
released on five years of parole.

188
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,070
He was now extending his criminal
earning potential by becoming a pimp.

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,590
He had a 16 year old girl working for him.

190
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,640

When one of his girls was
arrested for prostitution,

196
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,170
he was picked up and returned to Los
Angeles to face a 10 year sentence for

197
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:12,090

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,210
While serving his sentence,

201
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,140

202
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:19,891
The guitar runs,

203
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:23,050

Scientology during his time.

204
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:24,030
That's Mcneil Island.

205
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,740
He also became obsessed with the Beatles.

206
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,700
Charlie has an inflated appreciation
of his own musical talents,

207
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:33,660
claiming that he would with the right
backing and training be even bigger than

208
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:34,380
the Beatles.

209
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,620
Shawnee became friends with an
inmate by the name of Alvin carpets.

210
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,000
This former public enemy number one
was a former member of the infamous Ma

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,480
Barker gang.

212
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,670
He told Charlie how to
play the steel guitar.

213
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,350
This further fueled his musical obsession
and in 1966 Charlie's prison record

214
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,350
knows is that he spent most of
his free time writing songs.

215
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:55,860
It cumulating 80 or 90 of
them in a single competence.

216
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,560
Later commented on the Charlie
that he knew at that time.

217
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,280
He recalled that Manson was a
master manipulator of other people,

218
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,061
prison authorities.

219
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:03,241
Also,

220
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,510
he noted that he had a tremendous
drive to call attention to himself.

221
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,380
In June of 1966 Charlie was sent
once against Tom and Leiland.

222
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,930
This time in preparation
for early release.

223
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,850
When the day arrived on March the 21st
1967 he had spent more than half of his

224
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,530
32 years behind bars.

225
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,110
He requested that the
authorities let him stay in jail,

226
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,240
but he was told that he had to leave

227
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,350
and so it was that the five foot nothing
drifter with the penetrating stare and

228
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,530
gift of the Gab Wanders into the height
Ashbury district of San Francisco with

229
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:42,531
$35 in his pocket and to new plans
except for a desire to make it big in the

230
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:43,980
music business.

231
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,520
Jolly moves into an apartment in
Berkeley and made money by panhandling.

232
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,820
Before long he had gotten
to know a 23 year olds,

233
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,950
assistant librarian at UC
Berkeley named Mary Brunner.

234
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,240
He quickly one a rover and moved into
our apartments and Bronto came under

235
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,300
Charlie's felons.

236
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,640
He convinced her to widen out the home.

237
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Within a few months there were
18 young women living with them.

238
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,790
Charlie introduced Mary and the other
girls to drugs and before long Mary had

239
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,430
quit her job and become a
devoted follower of Manson.

240
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,230
The family was beginning to take shape
with his female entourage and his guitar.

241
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,040
Charlie merged perfectly into the heady
culture that was then in full bloom in

242
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,874
San Francisco.

243
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,110
He refined his role as a spiritual
master or guru as a prophet.

244
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,190
He used mind control techniques to
get girls to do whatever he wants it.

245
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,460
Most of the girls he gathered around
him came from troubled backgrounds and

246
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:33,120
suffered from insecurities that
left them directly opens a Charlie's

247
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,960
manipulations as well as breaking down
their inhibitions with mind control

248
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,441
techniques.

249
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,730
He used LSD and amphetamines to
control his ever expanding Horam.

250
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,730
After about nine months living
in and around San Francisco,

251
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,680
Charlie began to to spanner of the place.

252
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,220
They're tired.

253
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,130
He asserted become to overrun with
African Americans and crime was rampant.

254
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,681
Of course,

255
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:56,190
that family were doing their best
to add to those crimes statistics.

256
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
They stole credit cards and used
counterfeit money to get what they needed.

257
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,520
They also stole the big yellow
bus and painted it black

258
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,713
oh

259
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,920
Johnny and just follow his took to
traveling by bus down the California

260
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,600
coastline as far as Mexico and Texas
partying and committing more crimes after

261
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:16,201
18 months.

262
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,100
So extended travel.

263
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:21,570
They finally settled in Topanga Canyon
near Los Angeles in a two story house.

264
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,170
It was here that Ciani began gathering
some male members to the family.

265
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,780
The first was a teenager
named Bobby Beausoleil.

266
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,450
Lyle who turned up one night
for a party and then stayed on.

267
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,740
There's Charlie's righthand man,

268
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,720
but we had been staying
with his music teacher,

269
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,441
Gary Hinman,

270
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,790
not far from the Manson home.

271
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
What were you recruited
and 18 year olds and m's,

272
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,731
Leslie Van,

273
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,330
who teens or the family in
June of 1968 around that time,

274
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,780
Charlie and some of the girls traveled
to Los Angeles where they met up with a

275
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:50,170
record executive at Universal Studios
Format Jl friends feel Calvin had arranged

276
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:50,790
the meeting.

277
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,790
This was Charlie's entry into the rich
jet crowd and he turns on all of his

278
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,530
charm to make a good impression.

279
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,920
Seeing the family were rubbing shoulders
with the rich and famous it posh

280
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:04,450
parties in the Hollywood hills and the
late spring of 1968 beach boys drama.

281
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,230
Dennis Wilson was driving away from Malibu
beach when he happened to pick up two

282
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:08,980
hitchhikers.

283
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,830
The girls were part of the Manson family
and they quickly agreed to go back to

284
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,850
his Beverly hills home.

285
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,360
The three made love that afternoon and
Wilson left for a recording session

286
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,410
promising to return later to take up
where they left off when Wilson written

287
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,390
time in the early hours
of the following morning,

288
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,180
he was surprised to see that a
full scale party was underway.

289
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,630
He was greeted in the driveway by a
short man with a scraggly beard who

290
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,350
approached him,

291
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,220
dropped to his knees,

292
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,720
and began kissing his feet.

293
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
The girls who Dennis had met earlier,

294
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,880
I came running out declaring this is
the guy that we were telling you about.

295
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,380
This is Charlie.

296
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,490
Inside his home,

297
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,050
Wilson found a 12 more women,

298
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,720
most of them topless lying
around and smoking pot.

299
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,681
Manson told him,

300
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,960
but the girls were all
there for Wilson's pleasure.

301
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,840
Wilson was impressed with the sway
that Charlie held over the women.

302
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,770
He welcomes the family with open arms
and his home became the regular venue for

303
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,420
Charlie orchestrated orgies.

304
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,200
Wilson calls and Manson the wizard
and began inviting influential showbiz

305
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,340
friends do come and meet him.

306
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,130
Dennis also allowed Charlie
do you anything you wanted,

307
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,700
it's Ferrari or a Rolls Royce and all
the food and drink and drugs that he or

308
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,630
his group he's wanted.

309
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,560
Eventually Wilson's manager became fed
up with the influence and expense that

310
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:15,190
Manson was having on his clients and
Charlie and the girls were ordered out of

311
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,460
the mansion rim as well.

312
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,810
Also spreading of the children of the
rich and famous being given drugs and

313
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,530
having sex.

314
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm just [inaudible].

315
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,940
Suddenly the door do the
Hollywood elite lifestyle.

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,020
It would slam shut.

317
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,370
Charlie's planned for music.

318
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,050
Korea was also shut down.

319
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,660
This coolest a familiar
buildup of jealousy,

320
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,111
anger,

321
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,740
and rage that would inevitably
find expression in violence.

322
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,000
Madison managed to convince the owner
of a former western movie set the spawn.

323
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:44,200
Raj and chance would not far from Topanga
Canyon to allow the family to live in

324
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,160
the abandoned his property.

325
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,920
The family now moved to the ranch,

326
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,940
getting by by stealing and scavenging.

327
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,350
Jolly took to quoting the Bible.

328
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:53,800
It's family members as they gathered
round a bonfire during the evenings.

329
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,490
He also interpreted Beatle songs
explaining that the lyrics were directed

330
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,324
towards them.

331
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,860
He was obsessed with one
song helter skelter telling
his followers that the song

332
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,330
in visions and apocalypse brought on
by a race war of blacks killing whites.

333
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,620
The blacks would when he said,

334
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,400
but it would then sounds a
Manson to lead the new world

335
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,011
for Charlie.

336
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:17,311
However,

337
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,080
the revolution was taking too long.

338
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,450
He wants it to happen immediately.

339
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,620
He began preparing family members for a
series of actions that would precipitate

340
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,700
the black uprising.

341
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,120
The first step would be to release an
album of music that would contain subtle

342
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,640
messages that would ferment
the black revolution.

343
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,600
On May the eighth 1969 Terry Melcher
reproducer producer who had met Shawnee

344
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:40,440
through Dennis Wilson arrived at spawn
ranch to listen to Charlie and it's the

345
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:41,560
girl sing Melcher.

346
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,710
It made promises but never
followed through on them.

347
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,910
On the 25th of July,

348
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:49,911
1969 John old did Bobby beausoleil and
it's to women's of the home of Gary

349
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,170
Hinzman.

350
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,790
The music teacher Bobby
used to live with Manson,

351
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,870
had heard that Hinzman had
inherited $20,000 and he wanted us.

352
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,550
Hinzman refused to hand over the money.

353
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,820
Charlie was cools and soon
arrived off to screening as him.

354
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,010
Shawnee pulled out a
sword and cut off his ear.

355
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,080
Charlie then left with instructions.

356
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,000
Do you get the money or kill the man?

357
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,991
After three days,

358
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,790
Bobby stabbed his former teacher to death.

359
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,541
Before leaving.

360
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,240
He and the girls write the words
political piggy on the wall along with a

361
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,660
panther pour in red to lay the blame
on the Black Panther movements.

362
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,250
Bobby Beausoleil was arrested for murder
on August the sixth 1969 after being

363
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:26,210
core to driving around in Hyndman's car
Manson was now ready to get his revenge

364
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,110
on Terry Melcher,

365
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,550
the record producer who had let him down
on the evening of the 8th of August.

366
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,390
He directed followers tax Watson,

367
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,320
Linda Kasabian,

368
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,160
Susan Atkins,

369
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,420
and Patricia Crenn Winkle.

370
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,470
To the house where he believed Melcher
was living with instructions to totally

371
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,830
destroy everyone in is making
it as gruesome as possible.

372
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,640
The house was located at one
zero zero five zero clo drive,

373
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,380
but Melchert didn't live there anymore.

374
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,720
It was now occupied by a famous director,

375
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,650
Roman Polanski and his beautiful
eight month pregnant wife,

376
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,040
Sharon Tate there.

377
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,310
Nice Polanski was in
Europe on a film project.

378
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,280
His wife was entertaining guests
that the property hairdresser,

379
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,090
Jay Sebring,

380
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,600
screenwriter of Voya tag
fry Koski and coffee empire.

381
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:07,070
Irs Abigail Foga,

382
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,110
I think at the property around midnight,

383
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:11,540
Watson climbed to telephone
pole near the Gazans,

384
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,433
cut the phone line.

385
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,770
The car was then back to the bottom of
a hill that led to the house and the

386
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,870
murder team walked up to find the victims.

387
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,210
Watson thought the gate
might be electrified,

388
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:20,841
so he ends.

389
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,930
The girls climbed a brushing
embankments and get onto the grounds.

390
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,590
Just then car headlights came up from
further up on the property ordering the

391
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,060
women's or lie down in the bushes.

392
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:29,811
Watson approach,

393
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,750
the Vehicle Lens leveled is 22
caliber rifle at the driver.

394
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,280
That was 18 year old.

395
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,230
Steven parents,

396
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,660
what's in first slashed him with a knife
and then shot him four times in the

397
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:39,260
chest.

398
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,561
Watson,

399
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:42,530
some ordered Linda Kasabian to
keep watch down by the gate.

400
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,930
He and the other two women
made their way into the house.

401
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,530
The occupants were quickly gathered
together in the lounge when asked by for

402
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:49,640
Koski who they were.

403
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,600
Once in replied,

404
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,690
I'm the devil and I'm here
to do the devil's work.

405
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,940
What's in then began to
Tie v heavily pregnant.

406
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,940
Sharon Tate and JC bring together
by their necks with rope,

407
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,980
had brought and slung over a beam.

408
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,851
Went Sebring,

409
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,280
protested over the rough
handling of Sharon Watson,

410
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,800
shot him and then stamped him seven times.

411
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,770
Meanwhile for cal skate again
struggling with Susan Atkins,

412
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:13,160
he repeatedly stabbed him in
the legs and torso still free.

413
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,780
Cal Skate managed to
get to the front door.

414
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,440
Seeing this Watson rushed after him
meeting up with him on the porch and

415
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,620
smashing his head with gun bus before
shooting him twice or they go for,

416
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,530
had managed to escape out toms the art.

417
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,580
She was chased by Patricia Cranney
Winkle who tackled her and stabbed her to

418
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,270
death.

419
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,290
The only remaining victim was now Sharon
Tate as she lay on the lounge room

420
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,010
floor with a wrap arounds and actually
beg to be able to live long enough to

421
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:37,844
have a child,

422
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,320
but a police were ignored and either
Watkins or Atkins stabbed her repeatedly,

423
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,700
including in the abdomen until both
she and her unborn baby with debt,

424
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,400
remembering Manson's instructions
to leave a sign on the walls.

425
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,070
Atkins wrote the word
pig with Tate's blood.

426
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,930
The very next day the family struck
again this time the victims were Leno and

427
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,950
Rosemarie Lablanca unhappy
with the messiness of the
previous night's killings.

428
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,830
This time Charlie went with the
group to show them how it was done.

429
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,250
Different accounts have
been given the balance,

430
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,610
the exact happenings that night,

431
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,480
but we do know that Manson was in the
house and that he orchestrated the tying

432
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,314
up of the couple.

433
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,610
He then left with the orders that the
couple be killed before leaving the words

434
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:18,120
war.

435
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,720
Rise.

436
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,370
Death to pigs and helter skelter were
written with the blood of the victims on

437
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:25,440
the walls and the refrigerator door.

438
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,660
The murders caused a huge panic.

439
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,080
Hollywood's the pressure was now
on to solve the heinous crimes.

440
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,200
The police got nowhere until they finally
linked to the Hinman murder to the

441
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,490
tailor blanket killings.

442
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,880
They knew that Bobby Beausoleil Ale
had lived with a group of hippies.

443
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:44,870
It spawn ranch,

444
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,910
so they decided to pay
the ranch and visit.

445
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,490
Bobby's girlfriends had told
police that Charlie Manson,

446
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:50,310
they had bigger euro,

447
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,830
had ordered the killing of Henman.

448
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,280
Still,

449
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,160
there was no evidence linking
the group to the later murders.

450
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,500
Then in October 24 months
and family members,

451
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,340
including Charlie,

452
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,190
were arrested on charges of
arson and his grand thefts.

453
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,720
Seasoned Atkins was also
taken into custody and it
was she who fast to began to

454
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:06,620
spill the beans.

455
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,080
She brags to a cellmate of
hours killing Sharon Tate,

456
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,140
giving a detailed accounts
since implicating Charlie
as the mastermind's about.

457
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,851
At the same time,

458
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,440
police interviewed a
member of the streets,

459
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:16,700
Satan's motorcycle gang,

460
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:17,960
who was in Madison acquaintance.

461
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,100
He told them the Manson had recently
been bragging about knocking off five

462
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:22,640
people.

463
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,970
The first piece of physical evidence was
the fingerprints of Patricia ran Winkle

464
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,490
that was found on Sharon
Tate's bedroom door.

465
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,920
When other pieces of physical
evidence were recovered,

466
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,640
the police were ready to send the case
to court Manson and the four people who

467
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,330
had committed the Tate labianca murders
were found guilty and sentenced to

468
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:38,900
death.

469
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,733
These penalties,

470
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,750
however they would never be imposed.

471
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,250
In 1972 the California Supreme Court
declared the state's death penalty law

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,420
unconstitutional.

473
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,780
Manson's death sentence was
commuted to life imprisonment.

474
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,970
Charles Manson died on November the
19th 2017 of cardiac arrest having spent

475
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,650
nearly 50 years behind bars for his
orchestrating of the crimes that took the

476
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:05,180
worlds in 1969 he was 83 years of age,

477
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,980
so I really hope you enjoyed the video.

478
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:07,371

482
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,970
As you might guess from the name.

483
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,580
We look at all sorts of
interesting top tens.

484
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,950
You can check it out through
the link on the screen now,

but if you're looking at
something else to watch right now,

486
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,040
why not check out a biography from the
archives or a top tens video over there

487
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:28,874
on the right?

488
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,810
And as always,

489
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,040
thank you for watching.
