1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,990
Jim jones,

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,990
leader of the people's Temple has come
to symbolize the ultimate in sleazy evil

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,640
cults fingers through
a forceful personality,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,440
charm and genuine good works.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,730
He managed to draw a massive following
and lead them like a modern day Pied

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,290
Piper to the jungles of Guyana.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,560
There you promised them a
modern day garden of Eden.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,390
What they found was confinement,

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,810
mental and physical control
and enforced suicide.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,460
In this week's by and graphics,

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,730
we dive into the life
of the Real Jim Jones.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,980
James Warren Jones was born
on May the 13th 1931 to Lynn,

13
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,720
NASA Putnam and Jim Jones Sr in Crete,

14
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,350
Indiana.

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,390
The older Jim was a disabled war veteran,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,620
then NASA was some 15 years younger than
her husband's and the marriage was not

17
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,250
a happy one.

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,500
Jim was often away working on road crews,

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,390
leaving NASA isolated and lonely increase.

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:58,791
She,

21
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,740
it certainly didn't help her cause
though with our unsocial manner,

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,600
she smoked cast and voiced have to use
opinions at every opportunity and that's

23
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:06,770
uh,

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,610
has never wanted to be a mother.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,780
The addition of a child to the family
only increased the stress the drains were

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,410
facing.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,820
Shortly after the child's birth,

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,430
Jim suffered a complete nervous breakdown,

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,690
unable to work any longer.

30
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:22,620
The finances became dire leading to
very eviction from the family farm.

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,520
The homeless family were taken in by
Jim's relatives and the small town of Lynn

32
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:30,870
and Deana Lynn was a conservative orderly
town with the vast majority of the

33
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,150
townspeople being charged.

34
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,120
Guy With the town also has a
prominence at Ku Klux Klan membership.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,710
The drones is lived in a derelict shack
that lacked plumbing when young Jim

36
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,530
began school at the age of six
his mother took a factory job.

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,860
This provided the child's with the
freedom of before and after school to roam

38
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,460
the streets.

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,690
He was a needy child.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,020
He was terrified of his father
finding it difficult to make friends.

41
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,360
He spends a lot of time alone reading.

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,050
Often the challenge could
be seen wandering around
town looking disconsolate.

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,800
Elderly widows around town felt sympathy
for the young Waif fans would invite

44
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,940
him in for a piece of cake.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,170
The boy was so polite.

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,820
He soon one the mover.

47
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,660
It was through one of these
local matriarchs that Jim
got his first exposure to

48
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,900
religion by the way of
the Church of Nazarene.

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,790
Jim was constantly attentive,

50
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:19,260
even quoting scripture back to the
elderly woman to his mother's ambivalence,

51
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,570
Jim began attending
church with the old women.

52
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,910
He hung on every word coming
from the preachers mouth.

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,740
He also showed an amazing ability to
recite sermons and quote lengthly biblical

54
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,490
verses,

55
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,020
but Jim was not exclusively committed
to the Church of Nazarene is natural

56
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,500
inquisitiveness caused him to
attend every denomination in town.

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,370
During the week he would wander into the
woods and prop himself up on the stump

58
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,210
where he would proceed to do deliver
fiery sermons of his own to the local

59
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,050
forest animals.

60
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,890
This was pretty far outside of the norm
and it was just one reason why people

61
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:52,440
would remember young Jim
Jones as a weird kid.

62
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,420
His great interest in religion led to
an equally obsessive fascination with

63
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,020
death.

64
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,300
There were also other things that set
Jim apart from the other kids in Lynn.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,050
He cries a lot and he also,

66
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:06,390
he swore 40 much he would also
steal candy from the local store.

67
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,530
Further his odd religious obsession,

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,580
let him you come out with all sorts of
strange things such as that he was being

69
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,740
held down by the angel of death.

70
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,090
By the age of nine,

71
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,410
Jim was claiming 50 amps,

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,263
special powers.

73
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,910
One's eight he climbs on a roof and
cool down off everyone to watch him fly,

74
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,500
catapulting himself from the roof.

75
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,200
He promptly fell to the
ground and break his arm.

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,210
About that same time Jim
took see wandering around
town and is collecting road

77
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,220
kill in order to give each dead
animal an elaborate funeral.

78
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,310
The other kids looked onto
this with a morbid fascination.

79
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,690
Jim was 10 years old when America and
to the Second World War while all of his

80
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:42,640
school mates spends their recess playing,

81
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,080
there's marines or Gis.

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,300
He insisted on playing the Nazis,

83
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,870
particularly their leader at all,

84
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,950
fiddler with whom he was
absolutely enraptured.

85
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,010
He even went so far as recruiting younger
children and telling them into mini

86
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,844
storm treaters.

87
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,830
When they did not use step high enough,

88
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,630
he would whack them with a twig.

89
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,231
What'd he became?

90
00:03:59,231 --> 00:03:59,801
A teenager.

91
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,400
Jim's new favorite topic
changed from religion to sex.

92
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,620
He established himself
as the young peoples,

93
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,790
all authority on the subject and we'd
set up caught on his porch to teach the

94
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,860
facts of life in my new to detail,

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,060
to an eager audience.

96
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,240
It's mother was happy for him
to share his dbs knowledge,

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,100
but the parents of the other children,

98
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,880
well,

99
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,150
they were rather incensed at high
school gym set himself apart,

100
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,090
not just by his strange beliefs
and by a strange actions,

101
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,810
but also by his dress rather than
the casual dress that was normal.

102
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,840
He walked his Sunday
best every single day.

103
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,410
He also never spoke unless he
instigated the conversation.

104
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,010
However,

105
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,790
he did love to engage as teachers in
debates attempting to highlight his

106
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,900
superior intellect.

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,231
Now,

108
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,420
although not in any sense
a talented sportsman,

109
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,920
Jim was an exceptional organize that at
the age of 14 he established a baseball

110
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,420
league.

111
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,540
During one team meeting.

112
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,350
Some kids saw Jim drop a pattern
dog from his loft to its death.

113
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,760
After that it's the players.

114
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,700
They became scared of him
and the League fell apart.

115
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,780
By the early 1940 is Jim senior
had become a hopeless alcoholic.

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,320
His body was now ruined and as he had
suffered a stroke that left him unable to

117
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,154
speak legibly.

118
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,910
Then that's a,

119
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,780
took another man,

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,480
a secrets that was not so
secret in this small town.

121
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,950
Inevitably the marriage irrevocably broke
apart and Jim and Lenexa were divorced

122
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:18,490
in 1945 then NASA took Jim
and his move to Richmond,

123
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,860
Indiana while attending
high school gym works.

124
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:25,240
The night shift as an the anthem read
memorial hospital in December of 1948 he

125
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,290
graduated with honors,

126
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,730
which was quite an accomplishment for a
17 year olds who was also working a full

127
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,623
time job.

128
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,510
It was while working,

129
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,190
it's read memorial that Jim met,

130
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,050
courted and fell in love with a young
nurse by the name of Marcellin Baldwin and

131
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,010
was entranced by Jen who was four years
her junior and it's the couple were

132
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,290
married in 1949 together.

133
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,880
They moved to Indianapolis,

134
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,530
Indiana in Bloomington.

135
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,270
Masalin founds work as a nurse.

136
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,310
While her husband attended
Butler University.

137
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,550
The couple they now found themselves
living in the heart of Ku Klux Klan

138
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,270
country,

139
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,590
and it was in the midst of this redneck
country that Jim developed a passion for

140
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,520
two things,

141
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,770
racial integration and socialism.

142
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,870
In the spring of 1952 Jim accepted a
position as student pastor read some

143
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,950
Methodist church.

144
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,560
He excelled in the role and
quickly set up a youth center,

145
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,930
which was open to children of all faiths.

146
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,860
He seen recognize that the
way to attract crowds ends,

147
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,820
therefore to increase church donations,

148
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,970
was to adopt a flamboyance
Pentecostal style.

149
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,600
Men's make faith healing a
central part of his performances.

150
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,260
These performances began to gather wide
your attention and before long he was

151
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,480
being invited to preach.

152
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,050
It's conventions and assemblies throughout
Indiana and the surrounding states.

153
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,260
Regular services were held at
Elmwood temple in Cincinnati,

154
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:45,890
Ohio,

155
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,490
where he would invite those suffering
from ailments to come forward for the

156
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,470
laying on of hands even traveled as far
afield as Los Angeles to participate in

157
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,520
a healing convention.

158
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,140
By the Mid 1950s Jones was filling
the churches with his dramatic healing

159
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,580
sermons as each one.

160
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,600
He insisted that the audience
be completely integrators
and the black members of

161
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,730
the congregation sit up front facts,

162
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,640
which further ingratiated
him to local black people.

163
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,660
It was his insistence on
racial integration within
his flock that lends it to a

164
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:15,920
splits with Jim's church.

165
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,620
Employer should actually is
in Indianapolis at the time,

166
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,880
worked strictly segregated and Jim's
allowance of blacks was causing real

167
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:23,600
problems.

168
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,990
Jim,

169
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,710
he quit in disgust and set up
his own community unity church.

170
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,890
This soon morphed into
wings of deliverance,

171
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:35,891
which was renamed in 1955 as the
People's Temple Full Gospel Church

172
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,940
from the start.

173
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:45,810
People's temple grew large crowds of
both black and white parishioners.

174
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,540
The healing dramas web still
the highlight of every sermon,

175
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,660
but Jim's prime concern at to be building
a truly racially integrated ministry

176
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,090
in recognition of his efforts
to achieve racial harmony.

177
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,140
Jim was appointed in 1960 by
Indianapolis Mayor Charles Boswell.

178
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,840
The man has intended his
role to be low profile,

179
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:05,850
but Jim immediately took to the limelight,

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,780
appearing on TV and radio
programs dramatically proclaiming,

181
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,730
let my people go.

182
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,490
Jones threw himself into
the civil rights movements.

183
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,200
Through his efforts of the churches,

184
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,830
restaurants,

185
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,450
amusement parks and movie theaters,

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,860
they were all integrated.

187
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,850
In 1961 Jim collapsed as a
result of over exhaustion.

188
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,220
He was mistakenly taken
to a black hospital,

189
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,260
but when the mistake was identified,

190
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,460
he refused to move.

191
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,660
He even took to making the
beds and emptying the bedpans
of sick black people in

192
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:34,380
the wards.

193
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,580
This caused publicity,

194
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,750
which directs and the led to pressure on
hospital authorities to desegregate the

195
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:40,350
wards.

196
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:40,710
Now,

197
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,640
not surprisingly,

198
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:45,750
whites controlled churches and businesses
were highly critical of this upstarts

199
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:48,390
preacher who debt to
challenge the status quo,

200
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,680
thread swear received.

201
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:53,250
A swastika was painted on the wall of the
People's Temple Church building and to

202
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:53,491
dead.

203
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,930
Cat was tossed at Jim's,

204
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,900
if not the 1960s the drains is adopted.

205
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,700
Three children of Korean descent.

206
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,500
Jim referred to these children as his
rainbow family in an attempt to extend the

207
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,280
rainbow family.

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,390
He also encouraged members of his
congregation to likewise adopt wat on

209
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,224
refugees.

210
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,090
Now in the early 1960s Jim,

211
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,600
he became obsessed with the
prospect of a nuclear holocaust.

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,100
In December of 1961 he announced to his
congregation that he had a prophetic

213
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,540
dream in which the entire American
Midwest had been destroyed in a nuclear

214
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,930
conflagration officer.

215
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:26,700
Reasoning and magazine.

216
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,280
Ossicle insights holds nine
places in the world to hide.

217
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,500
He took his young family
on a trip to one of them,

218
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,000
Belo Horizonte in Brazil.

219
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,310
They stayed there for two years.

220
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,270
During this time is distrust and personal
hatred towards the governments of the

221
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,800
United States intensified.

222
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,540
He was convinced that American political
and economic self interest had brought

223
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,610
the world to the brink of destruction.

224
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,680
The drains is returned to Indianapolis
in December of 1963 Jim immediately made

225
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,040
plans to move his congregation who had
been waiting patiently for their leaders

226
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,580
return to another of the
nine safe places on the list.

227
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,780
Northern California.

228
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,580
In the summer of 1964 the family along
with about 140 congregants moved to the

229
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:09,330
town of Ukiah in the Redwood
Valley area above San Francisco.

230
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,680
Over the next few months,

231
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,790
church services were held in rented
church buildings and then as a rancher

232
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,230
Ridgewood throughout the week.

233
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,030
Jim worked as a high school teacher.

234
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,810
After three years of steadily building
up its membership for peoples temple was

235
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:24,900
grounded official standing by the
Christian Church Disciples of Christ,

236
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:25,681
northern California,

237
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:28,830
Nevada region in 1968
the following February,

238
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,280
the people's Temple,

239
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,500
Redwood Valley Complex Open,

240
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,480
the complex included the Jones home.

241
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,220
They swimming Pol Childcare Center,

242
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,090
old folks homes,

243
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,560
the temple meeting place,

244
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,394
and a ranch.

245
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,270
All of this of course was
completely integrators.

246
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,400
This let's all garden of Eden sat in the
middle of a strictly segregated Redwood

247
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,590
Valley.

248
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,250
Within a year,

249
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,070
the people's Temple had
expanded into San Francisco.

250
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,580
Buses were put onto transport new
parishioners there to Redwood Valley for

251
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,540
weekend services.

252
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,410
Jim also took to the road by bus
touring from one city to the next,

253
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,270
winning new converts in each place,

254
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,380
many of which were so captivated by the
charismatic preacher that they moved to

255
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,550
the Redwood Valley ranch.

256
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,150
People's Temple experienced
rapid expansion during the 1970s.

257
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,660
However,

258
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,800
it was also during this time that the
church received its first negative media

259
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,460
coverage.

260
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,540
A series of articles in the San Francisco
Examiner profiled the church painting

261
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:28,340
Jones as a false messiah who would claim
to bring 43 people back from the debt

262
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,570
if the authority structure,

263
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:30,530
all of the judge was,

264
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:30,891
I'll say,

265
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:31,940
put times of the spotlight,

266
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,030
the examiner articles
drew the interest of,

267
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,281
of uh,

268
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:35,180
media outlets.

269
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,871
From then on,

270
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:40,871
James came to view the media as the
enemy and agents of the devil himself.

271
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,020
Things got worse when in 1973 h
prominent members of the people's Temple

272
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,150
defected stories,

273
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
image to financial abuse,

274
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:48,411
mind controlled,

275
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:51,860
and tax evasion in response to the
pressure of brought upon the church by the

276
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,100
media in the defectors,

277
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,900
Jim first proposed the
idea of mass suicide.

278
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,010
Such a grandes action would establish
the congregants is Matas and shame those

279
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,880
who were out to get them.

280
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,801
As for how,

281
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,990
however Jones his words when
nothing more than bluster.

282
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,760
It was during the summer of 1973 that
Jones made the decision to relocate the

283
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:13,090
people's Temple to the South
American country of Guyana.

284
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,103
Two months later,

285
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,580
he visited the country in order to open
negotiations to purchase 27,000 acres of

286
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,970
lands in the Matthew Ridge area
near the Venezuelan border.

287
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,140
The guy and he is cooperative.

288
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,980
Republic was a socialist country and
for Jones he would pass through on his

289
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:31,060
return trip from Brazil in
1963 it was an ideal haven.

290
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,920
The first peoples temple members arrived
in Guyana in March of 1974 to begin the

291
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,090
mammoth task of clearing the jungle and
breaking grounds for construction on

292
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,410
what was to become Jonestown.

293
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:41,980
Yeah.

294
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,150
Later there were 50 people's Temple
Pine is in Guyana Day and night.

295
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,110
They worked to construct buildings
and establish a massive agricultural

296
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:50,944
projects.

297
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,490
By 1977 Jamestown was an
established community,

298
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,230
but things were getting worse.

299
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,130
Back in California.

300
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,900
On Memorial Day 1977 along
with 600 congregation members,

301
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Jones made an appearance at
a commemoration for suicides
who had jumped off San

302
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,550
Francisco Golden Gate Bridge
in his address on this day.

303
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,730
He declared I have been in a
suicidal mood myself today,

304
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,330
so I have personal empathy for
what we are doing here today.

305
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:16,981
By now,

306
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:20,890
there was renewed pressure on the church
from the American media on August the

307
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:24,730
first 1977 and also appeared
in new West magazine.

308
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,590
It's alleged that members had been beaten,

309
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,000
the church was rife with financial miss
dealings and that Jim Jones was nothing

310
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,260
more than a charlatan.

311
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,660
By the time the article
hit the new standards,

312
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,700
James was already in Guyana.

313
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,630
By September.

314
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,500
There were more than a thousand peoples
temple members in Guyana with only about

315
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,630
50 or so left in the United States.

316
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,980
The sudden influx of people placed severe
strain on the facilities at Jonestown.

317
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,730
However,

318
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,750
members enthusiastically pitched
into extends the village in order to

319
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,890
accommodate the demand.

320
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,940
Three quarters of the
transplanted residents were
black with the remainder being

321
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:58,420
white,

322
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,080
Hispanic,

323
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,591
Asian,

324
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,610
and native American.

325
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,580
The task of feeding housing
and clothing the community.

326
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,810
It was a massive undertaking,

327
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,780
but the temple members found a great
sense of pride in the feet that they were

328
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,240
accomplishing a utopian heaven on earth.

329
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,850
Despite the harsh conditions
and the hard work,

330
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,300
the people appeared in those first
few months to be genuinely happy.

331
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,380
Back in California at former members
began a concerted attack on the people's

332
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:20,860
Temple.

333
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,270
A woman who had born a child to Jane's
sued for custody of the child's,

334
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,690
which was living at the commune.

335
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,030
Joan's refuse to even consider giving up.

336
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,790
The child's declaring that any
attempt to do take the child,

337
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,000
we'd put the life of every member
of the people's Temple in jeopardy.

338
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,460
Still other defectors who
had left children behind.

339
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,840
Also sued for custody following vis a
declaration of human rights violations

340
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,160
committed by people's Temple,

341
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,260
well issued by defectors to the media.

342
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,011
It's included.

343
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:48,760
The assertion that rehearsals from our
suicide often took place at people's

344
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:49,420
Temple,

345
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,300
a committee of concerned relatives
that Jonestown was ms or more than a

346
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:57,230
concentration camp with armed guards
constantly patrolling and the residents

347
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,340
continually subjected to brainwashing
forced labor and sleep deprivation.

348
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,330
Attempts were made to pressure Congress
to establish an official investigation

349
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:06,164
of Jones down.

350
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,550
The challenge was taken up by Congressman
Leo Ryan representing the San Mateo

351
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,050
district of Northern California.

352
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,400
Ryan had determined to lead a fact finding
mission to Jonestown in order to find

353
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:20,840
out firsthand what was going on that
with reporters and relatives in tow,

354
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,060
he flew into the APP or
is it nearby Georgetown?

355
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,240
On November the 15th 1978 two days later,

356
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,410
they flew to the airstrip at criteria
and then we're driven by limousine into

357
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:34,670
the jungle towards Jamestown dreams had
been repairing the temple members for

358
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,380
the congressman's visit for weeks.

359
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,590
Every member knew that God's
were watching their every move.

360
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,310
They were commanded to portray
a glorious Utopian society.

361
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,820
Players were conducted in which the
members were told exactly what to say when

362
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,110
spoken to you by reporters.

363
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,350
Any signs of dissatisfaction would be
harshly dealt with away from prying eyes.

364
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,360
The congressman was warmly
welcomed into reception,

365
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:57,500
was held that first night.

366
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,800
Ryan seems genuine.

367
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,850
The impressed with the organization
and the order that he saw,

368
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,560
but late into the night one
of the reporters who would
come along with him was

369
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:08,300
secretly passed a note
from a man in the crowd,

370
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,580
the man he wanted to leave
with the congressmen.

371
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,150
The next morning he report it,

372
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,430
showed the note to the congressman.

373
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,030
Ryan brought the issue up with Jones who
declared that anyone was free to come

374
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,320
or go as they pleased.

375
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,280
There's prompted Ryan's.

376
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,840
You make a public declaration.

377
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:21,110
This,

378
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,530
anyone you wanted to leave with him at
the end of the weekends was most welcome.

379
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,640
Over that weekends,

380
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,870
many people came forward.

381
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,590
Then on the afternoon of the second day
of the visit or people's Temple member

382
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,570
lunged at Congressman Ryan with a knife.

383
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,860
This event soured the proceedings and
the visitors were intends on getting out

384
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:37,790
as fast as possible.

385
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,340
When the Congressmen's party left,

386
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,620
there were 14 people's
temple members with them.

387
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,650
They got into two trucks and were
driven back to the ass strep.

388
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,151
However,

389
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:53,880
the almost immediately after they left
dreads orders and the tractor and trailer

390
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,680
man's by armed body guards to follow them.

391
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,340
Just as the congressman reporters and
evacuees were about to board the plane and

392
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:01,350
head back to the safety
of the United States,

393
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,630
the truck and tractor
rolled onto the airstrip.

394
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,650
It was at this point for Jones has God's
immediately opens fire with sub machine

395
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,190
guns.

396
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,440
Congressman Ryan and
four others were killed.

397
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,100
Then one of the supposed to defectors
pulled out a handgun and began shooting at

398
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,130
those who had already made their way
onto one of the two waiting planes.

399
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,910
The leader of the killer
guards immediately radioed
back to Jones and told them

400
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:21,960
that the congressman was dead.

401
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,920
It was at this point,

402
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,430
the drains immediately began talking to
his followers over a loudspeaker system.

403
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,580
He told them that the congressman
had been killed and as a results,

404
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,600
the Soviet Union,

405
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,100
who we had been looking to
you for salvation would no
longer take them in with

406
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:37,680
the Americans went out certain descend
in armed forces to annihilate the

407
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,514
people's Temple.

408
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,210
He drive fear into his followers by
telling them Americans would torture their

409
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:42,900
children,

410
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,733
rape their women,

411
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,270
and it's brutalize their old people.

412
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,170
The only dignified response he said
was to commit mass revolutionary.

413
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,080
We didn't give it to die.

414
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,110
We can enact the revolutionary side
protesting the conditions of an angel main

415
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,313
world,

416
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,540
large barrels of cyanide laced Koolaid,

417
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,910
what rolled out and the people began
lining up to lay down their lives and mass

418
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:06,690
protest.

419
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,430
When you have those
people trying to beg off,

420
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,170
James told them not to be afraid.

421
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,840
They were simply stepping
over to another plane.

422
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,740
That day,

423
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,740
November the 18th 1978 914 members of
the people's temple lay down their lives.

424
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,580
Jones,

425
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,060
however,

426
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,160
did not succumb to the
cyanide laced koolaid.

427
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,410
He was found with a gunshot.

428
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,343
We into his head.

429
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,600
It was the Tamarind as
being self inflicted.

430
