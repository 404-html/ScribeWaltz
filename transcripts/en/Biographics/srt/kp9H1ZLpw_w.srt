1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,190
He was a comic genius.

2
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:06,191
You had only one speed setting and that
was full throttle for he burst into our

3
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,120
lives as an alien on happy days.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,430
He amazed us with his range of talents.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,170
It's utterly left us breathless.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,680
Yes,

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,360
behind the stick of Robin Williams
was a man who was deeply play,

8
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:17,300
goodbye depression.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,480
He had other demons such as
alcohol and cocaine as well.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,170
Still,

11
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,090
he kept us entertained to the variant,

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,360
which made it all the more unfathomable
to his legion of fans and admires me.

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,720
Took his life at the age of 63.

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,110
In today's biographics,

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,070
we intend to get the essence
of the real Robin Williams.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,040
Robin mcclaren Williams came
into the welds on July the 23rd,

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,050
1951 board at Saint Luke's
Hospital in Chicago,

18
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:55,680
Illinois.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
He was the only child of
Laurie and Robert Williams.

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,760
The family was wealthy with Robert to
being a senior executive at the Ford Motor

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,000
Company.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,910
Laurie was a full model
and two part time actress.

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,900
Lots of Robin's formative years were
spent a loan in the huge mention that was

24
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:10,620
his home.

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,180
In order to cope with his loneliness,

26
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,820
he created characters and
conversations in his head.

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,030
He was an overweight child which
lead to bullying at school.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,930
Sixth grade,

29
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,080
he later recalled was the most
difficult year of his life.

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,710
Many days he went to crying after
constant name calling and physical

31
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,520
harassments.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,590
Each day was torment for
him with his only friends,

33
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,960
being the ones he created
in his own imagination,

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,220
these difficult 20 years.

35
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,940
They brought on a depression that robin
was to grapple with for the rest of his

36
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,750
life.

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,600
Robin began by using comedy
as a defense mechanism.

38
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,010
It started with his mother.

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,510
Lori had a very sharp wit and we'd often
use humor and laced with sarcasm to

40
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,240
communicate with her son in
order to connect with that.

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,220
Robin Hanson make his mother laugh.

42
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,780
It wasn't good enough to be Robin.

43
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,430
He had to be funny Robin,

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,840
by the time he was 16,

45
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,010
the family had relocated to California
where Robin attended redwood high school.

46
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,490
It was the late sixties and the straight
laced robin found himself in the middle

47
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:05,820
of a counter culture that
revolved around drugs and sex.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,850
He was able to loosen up on
after dabbling with marijuana,

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,190
found himself fitting
in for the first time.

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,110
It was at redwood high that Robin,

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,120
he stumbled upon the drama department.

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,260
He had already perfected his comedic
vanilla quickly establishing a reputation

53
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:20,250
as the class clown.

54
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,390
He felt totally in love with the
idea of Improv performance is comedic

55
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,270
personality slowly emerging
through drama classes.

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,410
At the same time,

57
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,160
robin got involved in wrestling and
soccer proving to be an accomplished

58
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,910
athlete.

59
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,460
Bonds by the time he graduated in 1969,

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,750
he was voted by his classmates
as least likely to succeed.

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,740
Not surprisingly though,

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
he was also voted funniest students.

63
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,070
After graduating,

64
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,790
he attended Claremont
men's college is sites.

65
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,950
They were set on a career in
political science before long,

66
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:50,430
however,

67
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,550
he was spending more time in the college
theater when he was in lecture rims.

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,680
He won the coveted role of Fagan and the
college is production of Oliver Turning

69
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:02,920
in a performance that made it clear that
he was destined for the limelight even

70
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,750
behind his diplomatic ambitions.

71
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,450
Robin involved in a community
college has a program during classes.

72
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:12,280
See what often improvised
living as classmates and
teachers in fits of laughter.

73
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,410
After three years of honing his craft,

74
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,470
he was offered the opportunity of a
lifetime full of scholarship or to the

75
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,370
Julliard School of Performing
Arts in New York City.

76
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,470
Robin was one of only two
students accepted into the
1973 advanced program that

77
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,750
juilliard the other.

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,700
While that was future Superman
Christopher Reeve rave,

79
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,960
who would become a close friend,

80
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,400
recalled his first impressions.

81
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,720
Upon meeting Williams,

82
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,380
he wore a tie dye shirts with tracksuit
bottoms and talked to Marla minutes.

83
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,620
I'd never seen so much energy
contained in one person.

84
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,030
He was like an Untied Balloon that had
been inflated and immediately released.

85
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,330
I watched in horror as he virtually
chromed off the walls of the class and

86
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,050
hallways.

87
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,740
To say that he was on would
be a major understatement.

88
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,671
The juilliard.

89
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:55,211
Well Robin,

90
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:58,300
the heat astounded his teachers
and fellow students alike.

91
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,420
He was able to take on epicenter
of characters with ease,

92
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,760
trading out one accent
or dialect for another,

93
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,530
like he was born to do it,

94
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,670
but with the Robin,

95
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,170
he was frustrated at juilliard.

96
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,820
He just didn't fit in.

97
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,721
After two years,

98
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,480
his teachers told him that there was
nothing more that they could teach him.

99
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,120
One of his instructors
considered robin's via genius.

100
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:19,690
He was not being properly served by
schools conservative in its classical

101
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,524
training style.

102
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,790
He left juilliard in 1976 to
launch himself onto the world.

103
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,300
His first stop was the standup
circuit on the west coast.

104
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,230
Robin's first break into
the realms of comedy.

105
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,440
Okay.

106
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,990
Mr. Club in the San Francisco Bay area,

107
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,630
his first Gig was it the holy city zoo,

108
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,700
where he also spent time tending bar.

109
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,870
These early sides.

110
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,680
They were frantic,

111
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,090
bordering on psychotic.

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,570
No one had ever seen anything
quite like Robin Williams.

113
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,970
He played a collection of
rather edgy characters,

114
00:04:55,971 --> 00:05:00,000
including reverend oral
satisfaction is only standup,

115
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,550
was influenced by the likes of Lenny Bruce
Peter Sellers and Jonathan winters is

116
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,610
manage quickfire Adlib
routines and off the wall,

117
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:11,600
physical comedy proved an absolute
hit anti soon established.

118
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:12,560
A loyal following.

119
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,550
Robin loves the immediate feedback that
came with standup comedy and it was

120
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:20,240
something that he would continue right
through his career despite the apparent

121
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,410
ease of his performances.

122
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,730
He actually found stand up incredibly
stressful underneath the cloak of exact.

123
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,950
He wants an intensely shy man.

124
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,120
He once said that he started using drugs
and alcohol as a crutch to combat stage

125
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:37,121
nuts in 1977 when he moved to Los Angeles
where he began performing if a comedy

126
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:37,820
club.

127
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,300
It was here that he was discovered
by TV producer George Schlatter,

128
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,780
who offered him a spot in a
revival of the old sixties show.

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,160
Often now the show,

130
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:46,460
well,

131
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,990
it ultimately didn't survive,

132
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,490
but for Williams it established a
foothold into a career in television.

133
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,221
He became,

134
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:57,290
they send me regular cast member on the
Richard Pryor show while also continuing

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,400
perform standup.

136
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,560
It was an appearance on
the Richard Pryor show,

137
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,500
the brought Williams to the
attention of Gary Marshall,

138
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,280
the producer of the hit Sitcom,

139
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,163
happy days,

140
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,951
often five years.

141
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:07,361
This scripture,

142
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:07,730
it says,

143
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,310
while they were running out of ideas they,

144
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,330
they hadn't yet jumped the shark.

145
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,080
They decided to do an episode taking
off the 19 sixties Scifi comedy.

146
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,250
My favorite Martian,

147
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,340
the episode when it was called my favorite
organ and it called for the costing

148
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:23,430
of an access to play an alien from the
land of Org Marshall Thought Williams

149
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,680
might be the man for the job in one has
gone down as possibly the most brilliant

150
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,180
audition in TV history,

151
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,540
rubbing into the room and immediately
sat in the chair on his hat.

152
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,480
He continued to do his lines and then
broken Zune inspired Adlib Marshall.

153
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,880
It cost him on the spot.

154
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,990
Later commenting that Williams was the
only alien who turned up for the part the

155
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,920
episode of happy days.

156
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,220
It was originally shot is a dream
sequence on the part of Richie Cunningham.

157
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,611
However,

158
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:50,570
the character played by Williams mork
from ork was such a hit with the TV

159
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:54,680
watching audience after an initial
broadcast that the ending was refilled.

160
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,540
So mark was a real character.

161
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,830
Once your Robbins' work on the happy
days episode was improvised and augmented

162
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,850
with physical comedy,

163
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,960
audiences couldn't get enough of the
Zany adient and demanded much more.

164
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,450
This led to the creation
of the spinoff series,

165
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,261
Mork and mindy,

166
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,900
which ran from 1978 to 1982.

167
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,340
The show catapulted,

168
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,220
Williams do absolute
started literally overnight.

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,830
After just two weeks on the APP.

170
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,960
It had zoomed to the top
10 of the Nielsen Ratings,

171
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,070
the producers of the show.

172
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,160
They kept the script to loose enough to
give robin plenty of room to do as he

173
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:25,750
pleased,

174
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,480
and the results were unpredictable
over the top until areas.

175
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,291
While the critics,

176
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,030
they weren't overly
enthused with the show,

177
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,590
they went absolutely falling over
themselves to lavish praise upon it.

178
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,424
Star

179
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,990
woke up and it quickly became
a pop culture phenomenon.

180
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,040
A generation of kids took to warring
mark's Trademark Rainbow suspenders and

181
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,960
greeting their friends with the words no,

182
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,740
no.

183
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,970
Robin went from relative obscurity to
instant fame in the space of a couple of

184
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:01,420
months.

185
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,960
It was something that he was entirely
unprepared for and unfortunately it led to

186
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,420
him indulging in the
accessories that come with fame,

187
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,200
drugs,

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,430
alcohol and women.

189
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,350
Just Nike acted in the fast lane.

190
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,690
He also lived his life and
the fastest of fast names.

191
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,590
He quickly slipped into the habit
of partying into the early hours,

192
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,330
crawling home at five in the morning,

193
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,460
and then having to be on set by 10:00 AM.

194
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,600
There is no doubt though,

195
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,160
that Robin,

196
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,350
he was blessed with more physical
energy than most inevitably.

197
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,890
However,

198
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,810
that energy began to burn out.

199
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,820
He would sometimes fall asleep on the set.

200
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,340
We'll just sit a dormancy in off mode.

201
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,190
One night after performing a
late night set at a comedy club,

202
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,510
robin met up with fellow
comic John Belushi and ended
up at the Chateau Marmont

203
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,820
where Robin's shared some
of blue she's cocaine,

204
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,660
and then left the next day on
the set of Mork and Mindy Costar.

205
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,530
Pam dawber broke the news to Williams
knew she had died of a drug overdose.

206
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,880
The news well that shot him into making
significant changes in his lifestyle.

207
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,100
The death of Belushi tarnish the image
of Hollywood's fastest living brass pack.

208
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Robyn was called to testify before a
grand jury and experience which along with

209
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,790
the shock of Belushi's death and
the birth of his first child,

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,600
Zach allows him to break free from the
strangle hold of drugs and alcohol.

211
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,380
It was at this time that he discovered
cycling a form of exercise which you

212
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,360
credits for saving his life.

213
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,591
After four years,

214
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,630
Mork and mindy had lost its midas touch,

215
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,840
produces dried whatever they could
to resurrect the initial appeal,

216
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,580
but nothing seemed to work.

217
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
They decided to make more,

218
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,561
less naive,

219
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:28,500
allowing Williams to work in more
of his nightclub act material.

220
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,550
Interestingly,

221
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,730
the more character and also founded
sway into his standup routines,

222
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,480
though not by Robin's design
audience members at late night shows,

223
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:37,500
we'd simply yell out,

224
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,500
do more,

225
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,480
switch Robinwood,

226
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,700
frustratingly responds,

227
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,090
or mark's not here.

228
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm a different guy.

229
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,490
By the middle of 1982,

230
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:44,641
though,

231
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,360
the character that had propelled Williams
to superstar status was beginning to

232
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,790
feel like a millstone around his neck,

233
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,540
so it came as somewhat of a relief to
him when mork and mindy was canceled.

234
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,740
After Four Seasons

235
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,180
in 1976,

236
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:06,421
robin,

237
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:09,900
Ms Valerie Velarde while working
as a bartender in San Francisco.

238
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,490
Shortly after leaving Julliard,

239
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,670
she was a dancer having
studied at Julliard herself
or they began a relationship

240
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:18,030
that ends after two years were
married on June the fourth,

241
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,481
19,

242
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,314
78.

243
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,891
Valerie,

244
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:20,970
she endured husbands,

245
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,990
cocaine addiction,

246
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,050
and wild partying lifestyle
for a number of years,

247
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,760
as we mentioned the among other things,

248
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:29,130
it was the birth of his son
Zachary on April the 11th,

249
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:32,760
1983 that have led him to
finally shake off his addictions,

250
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,390
our thought that was one thing that he
was not able to control that that was his

251
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:36,901
wondering.

252
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,800
I ended up having an affair with a
cocktail waitress by the name of Michelle.

253
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,940
Tish caught up then in 1986 ms dot
[inaudible] sued Williams for six point

254
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:45,950
$4,000,000,

255
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,070
painting that he had knowingly
infected with herpes simplex virus.

256
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,330
He settled out of course only for his
wife to see if a divorce a few months

257
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,290
later on April the 30th,

258
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,070
1999,

259
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,220
less than a year after his divorce
from Valerie being finalized.

260
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,720
Williams married last year.

261
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,440
Grimes,

262
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,460
the form of [inaudible] 92.

263
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,350
His son Zach,

264
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,390
they had actually been carrying on
an affair during the last few years.

265
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:07,530
It was a previous marriage,

266
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,860
but at the time of the wedding last
year was pregnant with Robin's trials,

267
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,200
a daughter who they named Zelda Ray.

268
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,281
Two years later,

269
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,450
they had a second child,

270
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,313
cody Allen,

271
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,950
the marriage.

272
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,180
It lasted 19 years,

273
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:21,870
but Mysia finally left after she realized
she wasn't able to handle Robin's

274
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:23,700
relapse into addiction Williams.

275
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,520
He married for the third
and final time in 2011.

276
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
This wants to Susan Schneider,

277
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,120
who was a graphic designer at the time.

278
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,480
He met her while recovering
from a heart operation in 2009.

279
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,350
They were still together at
the time of his death in 2014

280
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,570
robin's fame on the small screen.

281
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,540
It's inevitably arouse the
interest of movie makers.

282
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,940
His first starring role came 19 eighties,

283
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
Popeye,

284
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,760
the maybe it was a financial amped,

285
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:59,440
critical flop mentally
like Williams is film.

286
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,350
Korea was over before it
took really gotten started,

287
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,810
but then in 1982 years,

288
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,181
the world,

289
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,110
according to Garp,

290
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,080
he was able to show more of
his dramatic acting talents.

291
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,530
The film,

292
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,130
it was well received with Chris
Abbott Calling Robin's performance

293
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,930
unconventional and absorbing,

294
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,460
following a couple of smaller roles.

295
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:18,760
He got his big screen break
in 1987 is good morning.

296
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:19,480
Vietnam.

297
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,061
This role,

298
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,190
it was Adrian Cron.

299
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,930
Our a real life armed forces dj stationed
in Saigon and during the war it was

300
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,060
tailor made for Williams as manic style.

301
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,570
In fact,

302
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,590
nearly everything that he did on screen
was totally improvised the performance.

303
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:36,640
It was good enough to earn him an academy
award nomination for best actor over

304
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:37,330
the next decade.

305
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,620
Williams appeared in an impressive number
of films displaying a huge range and

306
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,120
appeal across the generations.

307
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,870
He Sean,

308
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,160
as both a dramatic and to comic actor
with his first and only Oscar coming for

309
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:52,480
best supporting actor playing a
psychologist in 1997 is good will hunting.

310
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,200
He had previously received two
nominations for 1988 dead poets society in

311
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,031
Nineteen Ninety.

312
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:59,080
One was the fisher king,

313
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,500
perhaps Williams's most versatile role
was one in which he never actually was on

314
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:03,881
screen,

315
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:08,350
though it was his role as the genie in
the 1992 Disney animated musical Aladdin.

316
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,480
The role had been
specifically written them,

317
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:14,170
although he improvised much
of the dialogue just as he
had done in good morning

318
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,080
Vietnam Williams.

319
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,120
When told to play what would be his
most beloved character in 1993 is mrs

320
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,050
doubtfire.

321
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,651
In this movie,

322
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:24,580
he portrayed a recently divorced actor
who takes on the persona of an elderly

323
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:27,100
Scottish housemate to get
closer to his children.

324
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,420
He spent four hours everyday putting on
his makeup to play the part while the

325
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:31,770
movie.

326
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,770
It was a great success.

327
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,670
Sunday sequel was actually in the
works at the time of Williams,

328
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,720
his death in 2014.

329
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,930
His darkest role again in 2002.

330
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,541
One hour.

331
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,390
Photo Williams played a
lonely photo technician.

332
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:47,050
He becomes obsessed with a family he
photos he has developed for years.

333
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,420
He received rave reviews from such
esteemed critics is then at Melton and

334
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,420
Abbott's.

335
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,980
Robin's last parents on the big screen
was in 2014 night at the museum secret of

336
00:13:56,981 --> 00:14:00,790

as President Theodore Roosevelt in the

337
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,050
2015 film.

338
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,040
Absolutely anything.

339
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,730
He provided it.

340
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,660
The Voice of dentists,

341
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:05,230
the dog.

342
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,820
It's closed out a 38 year career
that encompassed 74 movies

343
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,220
in 1966 together with fellow celebrity
will be Goldberg and Billy Crystal.

344
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,470
Robin founded Comic Relief Usa.

345
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,080
The PRC helps the homeless with $80
million dollars being raised as of last

346
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,360
year.

347
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,590
Together with his second wife,

348
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:35,220
he also created the windfall foundation
to help donate money to a variety of

349
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:38,130
causes including some jude
children's research hospital.

350
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,420
On May the 27th,

351
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:39,781
19,

352
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,470
55.

353
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,890
Robin's close friend Christopher
Reeve was thrown from a horse and it's

354
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:44,724
paralyzed.

355
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,340
Robin drops everything and
rushed to get his bad side.

356
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,890
He turns up in full costume as a crazed
Russian doctor giving rave at the first

357
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,311
loft.

358
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:53,600
Since it's tragic accidents,

359
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,890
robin would go on to donate huge sums
to research and to spinal cord injury.

360
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,900
When reeves died into
counseling and forth,

361
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,790
robin was absolutely devastated.

362
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,640
Williams was also passionate
about supporting the military.

363
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,420
He traveled and performed at many bases
around the globe and he was well known

364
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,081
as a modern day.

365
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,914
Bob Hope.

366
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,850
During his career,

367
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,570
he entertained over 100,000
troops in 13 countries.

368
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,800
Williams managed to quit alcohol and
cocaine in the early 19 eighties,

369
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,370
however,

370
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,420
in 2003,

371
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,510
he lapse back into alcohol abuse
while working on the movie,

372
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:35,110
the big white or location in
Alaska for the next three years.

373
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,280
He denied that he had a problem.

374
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,940
Finally,

375
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,540
he was confronted by family and friends
who convinced him to check himself into

376
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,420
a substance abuse rehabilitation
center in Newburg,

377
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:43,841
Oregon,

378
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:48,460
and then he finally admitted that he
was an alcoholic after 60 days in Rehab,

379
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,020
rather than responding to his family,

380
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,950
robin began living with a sober companion
who was charged with ensuring that he

381
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:54,820
didn't relapse.

382
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,770
It was shortly after that that his wife,

383
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:57,121
Marcy,

384
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,810
I left him a depressed robin,

385
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,450
did what he always did to get
to by when life got tough,

386
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,570
he threw himself into his work
going on tour to do stand up,

387
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,610
but unfortunately in
the middle of this tour,

388
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:08,560
it was discovered that
he needed heart surgery.

389
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,640
The operation,

390
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,241
it went well,

391
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,850
but it required quite at
rest in order to recuperate.

392
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,530
This forced time of inactivity allowed
the demons in his head to have free rein.

393
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,730
Williams is addictive.

394
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:22,180
Personality led to marathon
cycling and video gaming sessions.

395
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,160
Cycling was a healthy obsession for him,

396
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,130
but for a man who struggled
with depression his whole life,

397
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,220
the Ng alone in a room with a
computer was very dangerous.

398
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Shortly after this,

399
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,470
he began drinking again.

400
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,800
This time we didn't care who
knew in May of 2014 Williams,

401
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:37,630
his new TV show,

402
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,680
the crazy ones was canceled after just
one season in July and he was back in

403
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:42,190
Rehab.

404
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,400
It was around that time that he also
learns that he had Parkinson's disease.

405
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,301
After his death,

406
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:50,050
it was discovered that what had been
diagnosed as Parkinson's was actually lewy

407
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:50,980
body dementia.

408
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,903
After his death,

409
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,060
Robin's wife Susan revealed that
Robin had been having severe runs,

410
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:57,370
prolonged episodes of fear and anxiety,

411
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,210
insomnia,

412
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:58,961
constipation,

413
00:16:58,961 --> 00:16:59,441
stress,

414
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:02,200
and having friends that have
been going on for over a year.

415
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,090
She said that he would
constantly tell her,

416
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,130
I just want to reboot my brain.

417
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,120
On August the 11th,

418
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,130
2014,

419
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,260
Robin Williams committed suicide
by hanging himself with bells.

420
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,850
He died from asphyxiation.

421
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,421
His wife,

422
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:13,841
Susan,

423
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:17,680
stated that he was killed by a
terrorist and signed my husband's brain.

424
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,140
Within hours of the tragic
news of his passing,

425
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,570
thousands of fans were
posting images of themselves,

426
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,520
standing on their desks with the caption,

427
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:24,941
oh,

428
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:25,690
captain,

429
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,740
my captain in reference to Robin's
character in dead poets society.

430
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,960
It was a fitting tribute and to beautiful.

431
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:33,670
