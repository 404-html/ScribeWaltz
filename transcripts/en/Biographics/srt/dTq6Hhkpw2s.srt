00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,070
or pulled the second ruled over
Belgium from 1865 to 1909 today.

5
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:20,510
The memory of his reign still lives on
and he is glorified with golden statues

6
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:23,720
of his likeness in every
major city in Belgium.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,703
In history class,

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,290
each generation is taught
that he was a humanitarian.

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,560
He brought Christianity and the wonders
of civilizations of the Congo Free

10
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:31,250
State.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,641
However,

12
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:34,460
the truth has been kept away
from the Belgium people.

13
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:35,880
The reality is the king Leopold.

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,910
The second is responsible for the murder
and mutilation of 10 million Congolese

15
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:41,480
people.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,200
In the video today we're looking at what
might just be the biggest cover up in

17
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:46,400
European history.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,190
Leopold.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,410
The second was born in 1835 to king
Leopold the first and is Luisa.

20
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:04,410
Maria Volley on.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,320
They were the very first role family
of Belgium because the country,

22
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,720
it was just five years old
for thousands of years.

23
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,600
That territory had been conquered
by nearby the Netherlands,

24
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:12,991
France,

25
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:13,411
Germany,

26
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,280
and Luxembourg.

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,140
They were a newly independent country.

28
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:19,110
There's had to get to form
a unique national identity.

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,651
Leopold,

30
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,890
the seconds had two younger siblings
called Felipe and Charlotte.

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,100
Their family life was
dysfunctional to say the least.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,280
Soon after Charlotte's
birth in 1844 king Leopold,

33
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:32,790
the first metric at 16 year
old girl named [inaudible].

34
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,040
He was 54 years old at the time,

35
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,220
but that didn't stop him from having
an affair with a teenage girl.

36
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,120
Clarence would go on to become a barren
s and her son's George and Arthur were

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,210
made into barons.

38
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,440
They weren't rumors that the uphold
the first ad to several other affairs,

39
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,840
so the exact number of half
siblings that the appalled.

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,930
The second has is actually
a known Queen Louise.

41
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:55,860
Maria was understandably miserable in
a marriage and she chose to let out her

42
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,940
anger on her children.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,950
She would make fun of young Leopold.

44
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,860
The second's large knows that
he inherited from his father.

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,570
She told her son that his
face was disfigured and that
he had the beak of a bird

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,850
in 1853 when he was 18 years old,

47
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:12,750
Leopold the second had an arranged
marriage with Marie Henry out of Austria

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,100
since he had never actually seen
what a loving marriage looks like.

49
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:19,020
The team couple were incredibly
awkward around one another.

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Someone in the Belgium rock ought had
commented that seeing them together,

51
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:26,460
it was like watching a nun and the
stable boy people thought the best was so

52
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:30,240
hilariously accurate that the phrase
was repeated amongst everyone who knew

53
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:30,960
them.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,190
Apparently his parents cad so less about
Leopold that they never even bothered

55
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:37,080
to tell them about the birds and the bees.

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,071
They're polled Zealand.

57
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,220
Queen Victoria of England had a
great marriage with our husbands,

58
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:45,240
Albert and she apparently gave
her nephew a lot of sacs advice.

59
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,260
This was probably just as awkward
as you are right now in engineering.

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,590
They uphold the seconds and Marie Henry
as eventually figured it out because

61
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,570
they managed to have
two daughters together.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,630
When Leopold the first dies in 1865
Leopold the seconds ascended the throne as

63
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,970
the new king of Belgium.

64
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,280
Since this personal life
was so dysfunctional,

65
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,390
it's really no surprise that his happiness
and satisfaction came from attaining

66
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,720
material thinks according to William
the second the ruler of Germany,

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,100
he was together watching a parade with
Leopold the second in Berlin when he

68
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,060
called and said there is really nothing
left for us king's except money.

69
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,091
Before he died,

70
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:30,290
king Leopold the seconds father and
made 50 attempts to conquer a colony for

71
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:30,950
Belgium,

72
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,420
but he always failed.

73
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,180
It was clear to him that the power
of other countries like England,

74
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:35,570
France,

75
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,021
Germany,

76
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:40,010
and the United States was thanks to
colonization there pulled the first belief

77
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,020
that without colonizing an African nation,

78
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,620
they would never be considered
one of the world's larger powers.

79
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,191
Leopold,

80
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,080
the second's picked up
where his father left off,

81
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:50,780
but he did not want to conquer
a nation on behalf of Belgium.

82
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,860
He blends to make an entire
country is personal property.

83
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,220
This way he could have complete control
and to have direct access to the

84
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,030
profits.

85
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,110
He knew that if he was honest
about his greedy intentions,

86
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,200
none of the other major powers would
agree to last him colonize an entire

87
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,370
country for himself,

88
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,880
so he simply told everyone that it was
his mission to spread Christianity,

89
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:11,810
do the Congo.

90
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,630
He wanted to convert and civilize.

91
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,850
There's poor godless souls.

92
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,590
In 1884 he met with 14 other European
nations at the Berlin conference.

93
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,310
He pitched his idea for colonizing the
Congo and cleaned that he wanted to spend

94
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:29,900
his own fortune bringing missionaries
to Africa out of the goodness of his own

95
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,590
heart.

96
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,340
He also promised the rest of Europe
that they could freely explore and trade

97
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
with his country.

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,841
The Congo,

99
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:39,440
though it was known for being incredibly
dangerous and difficult to colonize the

100
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:40,820
rain forest and Savannah,

101
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,230
they're filled with gorillas,

102
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:42,741
lions,

103
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,760
leopards and wolves.

104
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,290
The Congo river has Manny's in crocodiles
and hippopotamuses as well as insects

105
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,450
that carry deadly diseases in general.

106
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:54,170
It was a very wild place and not many
Europeans exactly wanted to go out there

107
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:54,920
and live.

108
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,960
If they're bought the second one
you to go and take on the challenge.

109
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,820
The other powers were
pretty much willing to say,

110
00:04:58,821 --> 00:04:59,150
well,

111
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,080
go on then.

112
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,321
Oh,

113
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:00,471
well,

114
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:02,600
she explorer in journalist
named Henry Morgan.

115
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:05,870
Stanley already had years
of experience in Africa.

116
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,830
He was sent on projects by several
different newspapers in the United Kingdom

117
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,290
and he became an expert on the continents.

118
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,161
Through his writing,

119
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:17,480
he tried to convince Queen Victoria
that despite all of the difficulty he

120
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:20,750
believed it would be worthwhile
to colonize the Congo.

121
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,680
Here's suggestions and ever made
any impact until king Leopold.

122
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,510
The seconds found his work.

123
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,650
In 1879 the king sent him on a
mission to colonize the Congo.

124
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,720
Henry Martin Stanley used parlor tricks.

125
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:36,830
Do you convince the African tribal
chiefs that white men were invincible?

126
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,030
He used a battery powered contraptions
and makers grips so strong that Congolese

127
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,300
men almost collapsed
from a single handshake.

128
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,991
Sadly,

129
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:48,640
claims that white men could wrap a
tree out of the grounds with their bare

130
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,220
hands.

131
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,720
He also held a magnifying glass in the
sunlight and use the sun's rays to light

132
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,291
a cigar,

133
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,960
claiming that to man
had power over the sun.

134
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,860
Finally,

135
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,600
he handed the gun to a need of men.

136
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,920
He instructed him to step back several
yards and try to shoot him sounded he had

137
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,960
taken the gunpowder and
bullets out beforehand,

138
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:06,381
of course,

139
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,060
and it's when the young
man build the trigger.

140
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,260
Stanley would double over dramatically
only to take his shoe off and shake the

141
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,700
bullet out onto the grounds.

142
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,330
He claims that white men were spirits
who could not be killed and no matter how

143
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:20,900
hard they it and the two bullets
which simply pass right through them.

144
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,590
This was enough to terrify the chiefs
into signing a contract which declared

145
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:27,530
king Leopold the seconds
for new owner of the Congo.

146
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,921
Of course,

147
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,040
the Congolese people had no idea
what the contract actually says,

148
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,940
but it served as a legal document
in the eyes of the European people.

149
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,241
Now,

150
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,910
Leopold's wants to keep up an image
that he was doing good in the country,

151
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,610
so he named it the Congo Free State.

152
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,570
Henry Morgan Stanley published a book
about his journey through Africa called

153
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,190
through the dark continent.

154
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,940
He was able to go on a lecture tour
around London and he was even knighted in

155
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,920
1899

156
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Leopold the second Trudy was paying for
all of the startup expenses do colonize

157
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,190
the Congo out of his own pockets.

158
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,850
He appointed governor generals to manage
the various territories of the country.

159
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,020
Leopold's men eventually discovered that
the rain forest had a plentiful supply

160
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,250
of rubber trees.

161
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,940
This,

162
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,370
it was essentially like
stumbling across a gold mine.

163
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:15,971
At the time.

164
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:19,120
There was a huge demand for natural
rubber in order to make tires,

165
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,070
but there was a very small supply.

166
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,240
The only problem of course,

167
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:27,241
was finding a way to pay for all of
the manual labor required the bolder

168
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,430
seconds.

169
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,790
Well,

170
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,640
he ordered his men to
enslave the Congolese people.

171
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,670
Each of the governor general's had
their own tactic to achieve this.

172
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,630
Usually they set a village on fire so
that there was no worth anyone's a height.

173
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,650
They would shoot and capture women of the
village and tell them that if they did

174
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,780
not bring back 15 kilograms of rubber,

175
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:44,770
by the end of the day,

176
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,810
they would kill their wives and daughters.

177
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,990
The Congo free state
was anything but free.

178
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,800
King Leopold.

179
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,040
The second believe that all of these
people were his personal slaves and he

180
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,870
could do whatever he wanted with them.

181
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,160
King Leopold passenger,

182
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:01,390
he handed out bonuses to the commanders
if they could produce more rubber by any

183
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:02,320
means necessary.

184
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,250
Leopold's began to grow his own private
army in the Congo called the force

185
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:06,910
publique.

186
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,010
When his men were destroying villages,

187
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,580
they would pick out the tool list
and strongest young men to recruit as

188
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:13,270
soldiers.

189
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,620
These soldiers were instructors
do systematically kill
anyone who disobeyed the

190
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,120
orders of the governor generals.

191
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,870
They were told to not waste any ammunition
and that they must kill a man with a

192
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:23,740
single bullet.

193
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,550
They were required to bring back one
severed hand for every bullet fired.

194
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,533
If they did not,

195
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,370
they would be killed by that general.

196
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,550
This led to the soldiers cutting off
hands of people that were still alive

197
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,380
whenever they wasted ammunition.

198
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,011
Meanwhile,

199
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:36,431
in Europe,

200
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,530
people have no idea what
was actually going on.

201
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,090
Word got around that King Leopold,

202
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:42,790
the second neater more soldiers to
help with his Christian missions.

203
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,230
You colonize the Congo,

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,060
hundreds of young men from Belgium,

205
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,391
Italy,

206
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:46,781
Norway,

207
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:47,231
Sweden,

208
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:47,771
Denmark,

209
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,690
they all signed up to join the force.

210
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,320
Publique.

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,980
They were taught that these black natives
worth animals and not fully human like

212
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:54,221
them,

213
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,660
so they shouldn't guilty about
killing them whenever necessary.

214
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,291
After a while,

215
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,041
these men,

216
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,960
they became desensitized to the killing.

217
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,970
Some of these soldiers
would Gus people learns,

218
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:07,170
pull out that end trails or slice off
a group of men's genitalia only to hang

219
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:07,890
them in a row.

220
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,210
Some of the Governor General's right,

221
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,260
that is to King Leopold.

222
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,430
The second about the scenes because they
were actually proud of their brutality.

223
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,520
They believed that the worst they
treated the Congolese people,

224
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,660
the harder they worked.

225
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,430
Overtime King Leopold's men managed to
enslave the entire population of the

226
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,490
country even though we'd promise that
the rest of the world could visit the

227
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,510
Congo whenever they want.

228
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,680
Since King Leopold,

229
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,400
the second's became very nervous when
he learned that Arabian merchants were

230
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,180
coming together,

231
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,500
some rubber for themselves.

232
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,050
He did not want to lose his
monopoly over the industry,

233
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:41,070
so he declared that they needed to go
to war with these so called Arab slave

234
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,610
traders,

235
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,830
which would free the Congolese people.

236
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,581
The sparks,

237
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,170
the two year Congo,

238
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:50,580
Arab war and 95 and English merchant
named Charles Stokes was on a mission for

239
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,950
the Germans do travel to
the Congo to purchase.

240
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:53,490
Rather,

241
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,120
he was hung by the force Republique
with out receiving a trial,

242
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,930
Germany and Britain,

243
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,110
they were outraged that he was killed
without ever committing any crime.

244
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,830
The of Holt was forced to pay
substantial fines to both governments for

245
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,910
violating the treaty,

246
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,590
and the incident was cooled.

247
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,640
The stokes Afaf,

248
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,211
however,

249
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,350
paying this fine,

250
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,940
it was a drop in the bucket.

251
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,650
King Leopold the second made a
profit of 220 million francs,

252
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:19,560
which would be worth more
than a billion dollars today

253
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,150
liberal.

254
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,900
The second time,

255
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,310
the team of propaganda writers to publish
books and articles about what a great

256
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:31,144
job he was doing.

257
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,840
None of these writers had ever actually
traveled to the Congo free stage,

258
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:37,200
but they were happy to
glorify their kings,

259
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:37,541
Christy,

260
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,170
and mission.

261
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:38,500
However,

262
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,810
journalists from Great Britain and the
United States were beginning to travels

263
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,400
the Congo Free State and report
on what they saw in the air.

264
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,450
As in 19 Americans have a war veteran
named George Washington Williams visited

265
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:52,060
the Congo Free State and he was horrified.

266
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,150
He wrote an open letter to King Leopold.

267
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,490
The seconds are counting the horrors
that he witnessed while visiting the

268
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,324
country.

269
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,193
The king,

270
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,280
he never replied.

271
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,970
A man named Edelman's Denny moral
worked as a clerk at a shipping firm in

272
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:04,331
Liverpool.

273
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,440
Linkedin's Belgium ships would come and
go delivering rubber to Liverpool from

274
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:12,700
the Congo mural knew that it wouldn't be
possible for Belgium to produce such a

275
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:16,120
high volume of rubber and less
they were using slave labor.

276
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,960
He began investigating and when
he discovered the horizontal,

277
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,200
what was actually happening,

278
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:23,860
he wrote several anonymous articles for
a British newspaper called the speaker

279
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,290
exposing the truth about what he saw.

280
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,950
He wrote,

281
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,950
this was the greatest crime that has
ever been committed in the history of the

282
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,424
world.

283
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,300
In 1901 the shipping company offered
moral a job to manage the shipments of

284
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,680
rubber to and from the Congo.

285
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,120
They were willing to pay him a huge
salary in exchange for his silence.

286
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,660
He turned it down and became a
full time journalist and stat.

287
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,900
It became so passionate about the
cause that he began publishing his own

288
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:50,441
newspaper,

289
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:53,800
called the west African male with
any new information he founds.

290
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,890
In 1906 he published a book called Red
Rubber and other journalists name's Roger

291
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,081
Casement,

292
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:02,020
was sent to interview people of the
Congo to get their testimonies about the

293
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,730
human rights abuses in the country.

294
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,390
He realized that it was
crucial to convince the White
Christian missionaries to

295
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:10,960
come forward with their stories because
they had been there from the beginning

296
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,730
and they could prove that king Leopold.

297
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,750
The second was aware of the atrocities
after Roger casements report was

298
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,201
published,

299
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:17,741
King Leopold,

300
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:20,740
the second he knew that if he did
not respond with his own inquiry,

301
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,420
this would be the end of him.

302
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,420
He sent his own international commission
to the Congo in the hopes that he could

303
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,170
bribe them.

304
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,040
He thought that he could pay them off to
publish whatever he wanted them to say,

305
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,360
but this totally backfired and Christy
and missionary named John Harris had been

306
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,340
living in the Congo Free State for years.

307
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,770
He and his wife devoted
their lives to helping me,

308
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,700
Congolese people.

309
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,220
When King Leopold's international
commission showed up,

310
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,140
John Harris was ready for them.

311
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,770
He gathers a group of Congolese
people who testified to the death,

312
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,310
torture,

313
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,000
mutilation,

314
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,480
rape,

315
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,970
and then save them that they
suffered at the hands of the king.

316
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,720
His wife,

317
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,351
Alice Harris,

318
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:57,010
was a photographer and she was able to
present them with photographic evidence

319
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,080
of the horse that they had seen.

320
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,450
When the international
commission returned to Belgium,

321
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:04,930
they published a 50 page report on all
the human rights abuses that they had

322
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:05,920
found in the Congo.

323
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,720
They submitted it to king there,

324
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:07,950
Paul,

325
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,620
the seconds once he realized that he
could no longer get away with his lies,

326
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,490
Leopold audit,

327
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,210
all of the Congo free state records
to be burned so that there would be no

328
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,590
evidence of his crimes.

329
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,230
In 19 eight the Congo
became a Belgium colony,

330
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,060
but they didn't seize it from the king.

331
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,601
Instead,

332
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,120
they paid him 50 million
francs for the purchase.

333
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,130
He dies just one year later in 1909

334
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,350
once the Belgium government
visited the Congo,

335
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:39,340
they found far more profitable
resources than just rubber.

336
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,550
They were diamonds,

337
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:40,971
gold,

338
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:43,940
and ivory that could be
sold for massive profits.

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
The government ended slavery and employed
the Congolese people to work for wages

340
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,110
instead very soon after Belgium
became extremely wealthy,

341
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,130
the city of Brussels.

342
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,100
Now some of the most breathtaking
architecture in the world is complete with

343
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,810
golden statues of King Leopold.

344
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:57,590
The seconds,

345
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,290
all because of the money that
he brought from the Congo,

346
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,610
but the Belgium government,

347
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,900
they had to make a decision.

348
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,370
What do they tell if a public Leopold
the second line to his people for a long

349
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:10,640
time and they looked up to him like a
father figure who brought glory to the

350
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,400
country.

351
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,550
Not only would the
citizens be disappointed,

352
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,280
but it would make Belgium look
terrible to the outside world.

353
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,070
Their nation was still less than
a hundred years old at the time.

354
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,240
England in the United States had already
outlawed slavery in the 18 hundreds so

355
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,440
the king of Belgium had essentially taken
a big step backwards in humanitarian

356
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:28,160
progress.

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,820
The Belgium government chose to allow
their people to continue believing the lie

358
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,250
that King Leopold the
second to built for himself,

359
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,370
they taught their children that there
was never any slavery in the Congo.

360
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:39,220
Free stays in that
everything king Leopold.

361
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,940
The second did was wonderful.

362
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,790
This lie was retold
generation after generation,

363
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:48,110
so the point we're at became then you
truth and part of that cultural identity.

364
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Before his death in 1897 the apple of
the created a human zoo at his summer

365
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,230
estate.

366
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,670
He bolts and muddle African village and
captured to 267 Congolese people to live

367
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,900
that Belgium people showed up to Gawk at
them throwing peanuts and bananas over

368
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,030
the fence as if they were monkeys.

369
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,110
They were forced to stay outdoors in
this village and all kinds of weather.

370
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,050
Several of those people dying of influenza
and pneumonia after he died to the

371
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,610
king's estates became the Royal Museum
of Central Africa and to continue to

372
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,690
glorify Leopold.

373
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:22,100
The seconds achievements in colonization
decades after his death in 1958 the

374
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:26,270
governments of Belgium even went as
far as to replicate is human zoo at the

375
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,530
Brussels welfare,

376
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,560
putting Congolese people
on display like animals.

377
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,483
Once again,

378
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,660
nearly every western nation has some
history of slavery and genocide,

379
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,990
but in most Belgian school classes they
will never have the truth about king

380
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:39,471
Leopold.

381
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,880
The seconds they will say that slavery
never happened in the Congo since the

382
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:44,870
records were destroyed.

383
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,670
We will never know just to many people,

384
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:51,320
Leopold was responsible for killing some
estimate that it is roughly 4 million

385
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,350
while others believe it is as high as
10 somewhere between 70 to 90% of the

386
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:00,470
total population was wiped out
in the age of the Internet.

387
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,650
It does.

388
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,280
It become much more difficult for Belgium
to ignore the reality of what happens.

389
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,080
In 2018 the curators of the Royal Museum
of Central Africa finally decided to

390
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:13,370
change the exhibits to honor the lives
lost by the native Congolese people.

391
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,941
However,

392
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:17,360
Congolese people who've visited the
exhibits said that it is still not enough

393
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:20,990
and that as long as the story is told
from the perspective of a Belgium white

394
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,650
person,

395
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,970
the country will never show you the full
truth about the monstrous deeds of King

396
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:26,421
Leopold.

397
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:27,254
The seconds.

398
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,650
So in some way the Internet has become
an incredible way for smaller voices to

399
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,250
be heard and if there is something your
passionate about and you want to share
