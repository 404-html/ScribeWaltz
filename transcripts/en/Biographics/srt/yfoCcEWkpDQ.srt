1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,280
He was the self proclaimed,

2
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:03,920
the Messiah who looked like a Rockstar,

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,400
a mesmerizing personality and Passionate
Bible knowledge combined to allow him

4
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,390
to gain ascendancy over a small group
of followers to manipulate them,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,160
use them for his sexual desires,

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:17,730
and prepare them for his
own version of Armageddon.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,351
Vernon,

8
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:30,951
Wayne Howell,

9
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:34,250
the child who would become David
Koresh was born on August the 17th,

10
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,780
1959 in Houston,

11
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:36,530
Texas.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,011
His mother,

13
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:37,701
Bonnie Clark,

14
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:39,880
was just 14 at the time while his father,

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,460
carpenter,

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:40,761
bobby,

17
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:42,440
how was a 20 year old,

18
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:46,220
a drifter who abandoned his pregnant
girlfriend's when another girl caught his

19
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:46,700
eye,

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,000
Bonnie soon to come up with a
man who was a violent drunk.

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,030
They were married with a union
lasting for just two years.

22
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,260
They proved to be torturous.

23
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:55,250
He is for the infant.

24
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,760
He was often recall in later life
how his stepfather mistreated him.

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,200
When the marriage was dissolved,

26
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,110
Vernon was taken in by
his maternal grandmother,

27
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,100
Elaine Clark.

28
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,300
He grew into a likable,

29
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,340
but Mr Rothschild,

30
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,400
who was highly active.

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:07,941
In fact,

32
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:12,440
he was given the nickname sputnik due to
his boundless energy in recognition of

33
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,540
the Soviet satellite by age six,

34
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,490
Vernon was taken back in with his mother.

35
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,100
Bonnie has just married
a man by the name of Roy,

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,620
held a man when he moved
in with his mother,

37
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:22,720
she was pregnant again,

38
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,340
and in 1966 she gave birth to Vernon's.

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,110
His younger brother,

40
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,230
Ron Vernon,

41
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,580
struggled in school,

42
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:32,030
unable to keep up in elementary school
to the extent that he was placed in a

43
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,080
remedial class.

44
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,570
The other kids in his school
soon had a nickname for him.

45
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,770
Mr Retardo,

46
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,610
years later,

47
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,570
Vernon recalls the effects that this
ostracism has on his self esteem.

48
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,590
I mean your,

49
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,160
you know,

50
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,630
here comes the retarded kids and
it's like I stopped in my tracks.

51
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,140
It is believed that one of the main
reasons that Vernon struggled academically

52
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,050
was that he suffered from dyslexia,

53
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:53,601
rare condition,

54
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:55,910
which was little recognized at the time.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,450
It was also a stutterer.

56
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,280
It was clear,

57
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,671
however,

58
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,260
that the boy wasn't stupid.

59
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,130
He has a natural mechanical ability and
loved nothing more than pulling gadgets

60
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,990
apart and putting them
back together again.

61
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,490
By the time it was a preteen,

62
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,850
Vernon's affinity with mechanics
that morphed into a love for cars.

63
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,780
It also lets him in a roundabout way to
music finding an abandoned and broken

64
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:15,591
guitar and a bond.

65
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,230
He fixed it up and began
teaching himself to play.

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,830
Vernon's other great
interest was in religion.

67
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,960
His family were seventh day adventists,

68
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,500
Cintas,

69
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,960
grandmother often had him
accompany how to church.

70
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,170
He was reared within the
confines of that way of worship,

71
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:39,520
which means no chasing after girls
taking drugs or going to teen parties.

72
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,060
While his peers were
engaged in those activities.

73
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,030
Vernon was busy reading the Bible and
is watching everything religious that he

74
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,300
could find on tv or read
in books and magazines.

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,230
By the age of 10,

76
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,750
he was able to recite long
passages of scripture.

77
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,660
Ends was giving his own many
sermons at home as a preteen then,

78
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:58,010
and we're still a statue.

79
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,070
You combined his passion for
scripture with his efforts.

80
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:04,810
Do overcome this speech impediments by
listening to powerful sermons on the

81
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,190
radio and then reciting the preachers
words he would study and emulates the

82
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,770
vocal skills of the speaker
discovering this when he did so,

83
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,480
his stutter disappeared.

84
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,840
Vernon's formal schooling finished when
he drops out during his junior year at

85
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,910
Garland high school.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,240
If the 18 year old gained work
as a carpenter in gallons,

87
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,500
it was there that he began a relationship
with a 15 year old girl when she fell

88
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,910
pregnant to the girl's father,

89
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,170
became enraged.

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,280
He forced his daughter to break off the
relationship and warns Vernon to stay

91
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,090
away.

92
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,560
Vernon was in love with girl,

93
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:36,700
but so the only option,

94
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,800
but to heed the father's advice by now,

95
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,020
his family were living in Tyler,

96
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,710
Texas.

97
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,220
It was the ad was he approached his
local seventh day adventist elders and

98
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,960
really old style data to them.

99
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,320
He told them that he felt a moral
obligation to marry the girl.

100
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,071
He was surprised.

101
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,401
However,

102
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,830
when the eldest trying to
persuade him against doing so,

103
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,550
he had time to do reason scripturally
with them only to find that they were

104
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,540
getting angry with him.

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,231
In the ends,

106
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,870
they simply ordered
him to leave the church

107
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,080
as a result of Vernon situation,

108
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,821
not only here,

109
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:15,270
but his entire family were excommunicated
from the seventh day adventist church,

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,400
thoroughly disgusted
with the organization.

111
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,130
He began looking around
for an alternative church.

112
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,090
He was told about a group called the
branch Davidians who were based in Waco,

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,990
Texas.

114
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,920
The branch Davidians,

115
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:26,270
uh,

116
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,790
an offshoots of an offshoot
of the seventh day adventists.

117
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,870
This original group was founded in 1929
by a Bulgarian immigrants in theU ,

118
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,010
s named Victor,

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,960
who tiff originally cools
the shepherd's raags.

120
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,840
The sex was set up in Waco,

121
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:40,530
Texas.

122
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,150
The group were convinced that the
apocalypse was going to a car in 1959,

123
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:45,900
and when it didn't,

124
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,500
a group broke away under the leadership
of a man named Benjamin Roden,

125
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,420
he called this group the branch Davidians
in recognition of their holding to the

126
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,390
coming restoration of the
Davidic Kingdom of Israel.

127
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,650
In 1978,

128
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,130
roden died and his wife Lois
assumed leadership of the church.

129
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,580
Vernon Howell arrived at the
branch Davidian compound in 1980.

130
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,950
The 20 year old has long flowing hair,

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,360
a charismatic personality,

132
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,010
and a self effacing manner.

133
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,820
He appeared to be extremely spiritual
to those that he met at the compound

134
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:19,230
holding to a strict moral code and
judging himself as chief among sinners.

135
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,830
He turns up with his guitar and the
desire to use this music to reach young

136
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,020
people with the message of the Lord.

137
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,660
Lois Roden was immediately taken with
how old and she invited him to move into

138
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,390
the compound.

139
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,931
Before long,

140
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,820
the two became romantically involved,

141
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,700
despite the fact that
she was in her sixties,

142
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,480
lowest began to give vernon growing
prominence as a teacher at the compounds.

143
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,200
She would give them time at the pulpit
so he could expand his interpretations to

144
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,250
the congregation.

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,790
Vernon's preaching style
was very different to what
the church goers we're used

146
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,660
to experiencing.

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,170
He wore a t shirts and jeans and spoke
with illustrations that will often

148
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,760
startling and their directness.

149
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,511
On one occasion,

150
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:58,880
he likens sin to snot on a person's
finger that he just can't get off.

151
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,631
Above all,

152
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:02,690
he acknowledged himself
as imperfect as weak,

153
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,180
and does a center then
in his natural charisma,

154
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,410
has unkempt looks,

155
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,850
the downward style,

156
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,850
and his deep scriptural
knowledge where a potent mix.

157
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,110
He purposefully positioned himself in
the light of Jesus in opposition to the

158
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,400
state formulaic and have a critical
pharisees of mainstream religion.

159
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,870
His status was elevated even further
when he began to proclaim the gift of

160
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:24,704
prophecy.

161
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,810
A few months after Vernon had moved in,

162
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,380
though it's made the bombshell public
announcement that she was pregnant with

163
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,220
his child.

164
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,240
She told her followers this was all
part of God's divine arrangements.

165
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,780
However,

166
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,610
she would go onto miscarried the baby.

167
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,060
However,

168
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,040
she still elevated Vernon as spiritual
as and as the next leader of the branch

169
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:43,874
Davidians.

170
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,960
Many in the congregation
were in agreements of Lewis's
consecration of Vernon as

171
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,803
her successor,

172
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,090
but there was one who was definitely
not and that would be lowest.

173
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,030
His son George George viewed
Vernon as a dangerous.

174
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:06,200
You suffer who is shamefully manipulated
his way into his mother's good graces

175
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,920
and was now poised to take over the
leadership that was rightfully George's to

176
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,754
inherit.

177
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,260
Over the next three years,

178
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:16,040
a power struggle was to play out between
Vernon and George with the congregation

179
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,390
split between the two.

180
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Tensions came to a peak in
1984 when George and his
arm supporters forced Vernon

181
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:26,930
and about 25 of his followers to leave
the compounds at Mount Carmel for the

182
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,310
next two years.

183
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,230
This group was situated in Palestine,

184
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:34,700
Texas 90 miles away where they
had to live in buses and tense.

185
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,570
During this time,

186
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,380
vernon put his skills into building up
his base of followers through his music

187
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:40,940
and the power of his personality.

188
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,120
He was able to attract new
members from far and wide.

189
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
In 1985,

190
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,300
he traveled to Israel
with his pregnant wife,

191
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,081
Rachel Jones.

192
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,910
He was one of the congregation members.

193
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,660
It was while in the holy lands that he
became convinced that he was the modern

194
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,870
day incarnation of King Cyrus of Persia.

195
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,010
He had been tasked,

196
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,670
he claimed with opening the seven
seals of the book of revelation and

197
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,300
proclaiming them to all the world's back.

198
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,130
Now Common George Roden was
acting increasingly erratic,

199
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,820
which was causing his
followers to decline rapidly.

200
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,290
Many of the compounds openly supportive
Vernon howland's longs for his return.

201
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Lois roden died in 1986 and George was
determined to eliminate the threats that

202
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,460
Vernon posed to his leadership.

203
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,660
He decided to call vern,

204
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,870
announced by challenging him
to a resurrection competition.

205
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,980
The man that could successfully raise
a dead person would be the acknowledged

206
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,120
leader of the church in order to achieve
a sentence and are clearly psychotic.

207
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,830
George has a body of zooms.

208
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,210
When Vernon heard about this,

209
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:41,990
he went directly to the authorities and
later complaints that George had been

210
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:43,580
tampering with a dead body.

211
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,480
He was told that the authorities could
do nothing unless they had photographic

212
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:52,190
evidence in order to obtain the needed
per that seven armed supporters into

213
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,920
Mount Carmel before they
could find the exuma body.

214
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,090
They were discovered by George's
followers and a gunfight broke out in the

215
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,650
skirmish region was wounded.

216
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,460
The police broke up the battle and Vernon
and his followers were arrested and

217
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
put on trial for attempted murder.

218
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,480
I need to later be acquitted of all
charges over the next couple of years.

219
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,600
Vernon's following it.

220
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,490
Palestine grew back at Mount Carmel.

221
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:19,320
George became even more irrational when
one of his supposed followers challenged

222
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:19,500
him,

223
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,730
claiming to be the messiah.

224
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,700
George lost control and
killed the man with an ax.

225
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,360
This act saw him being sent to a
hospital for the criminally insane

226
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,770
with George now well and truly out of
the way vernon and his followers oriented

227
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,070
the Mount Carmel Compounds.

228
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,240
He was now the undisputed leader of the
branch Davidians not long after his rita

229
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,700
and he had his name legally
changed to David Koresh.

230
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,580
Koresh is the Hebrew name for Cyrus,

231
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:53,140
who David was convinced he was the modern
day incarnation of with this new name

232
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,900
came the conviction that
Koresh was more than a prophet.

233
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,960
He was the Modern Day Messiah and the
words that he spoke were of divine origin

234
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,290
as the 19 nineties,

235
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,810
Dawn's David Koresh
was a 30 year old self,

236
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,120
proclaimed the messiah with a
young wife and two children.

237
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,350
He presided over more than 100 faithful
adherence who lived together in a single

238
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,243
large building,

239
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,510
having mastered the fusion of religious
music and inspiration or proselytizing,

240
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,730
Koresh's marathon sermons could last all
day and all night still for believers

241
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,230
would hang on his every word.

242
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,500
Gresh began using his position as the
revealer of God gone well to announce

243
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,390
supposedly divine decrees that were
increasingly to his personal advantage.

244
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,870
One of the most controversial was that
all of the women in the complex were to

245
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,610
be available to him at any time.

246
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,620
For his sexual pleasure is included.

247
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,060
All of the married women as well Koresh
did not confine his sexual liaisons to

248
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,840
adult women.

249
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Girls as young as 12
became his sexual partners.

250
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,230
These girls had been convinced that to
give themselves over to God in the form

251
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:53,470
of Koresh was the greatest
privilege that they could attain.

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,760
The men of Mount Carmel,

253
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,320
including those who were married,

254
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,730
were to remain celibate.

255
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,000
This was because there was only one
seed that was holy and it flowed from,

256
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:01,061
uh,

257
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:01,690
Koresh.

258
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,410
As a result,

259
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,740
the majority of the children that the
complex where his at the time of his

260
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:06,160
death,

261
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,500
he was father to 15 sons and daughters.

262
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,920
While the majority of the branch Davidians
excepted this arrangement is the will

263
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,490
of God.

264
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,050
There were a handful of dissenters.

265
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,650
You left the church because of some
of those who left were Australian.

266
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,480
When they returned back home to Australia,

267
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,810
they went to the American embassy and
child abuse charges were laid against

268
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,550
Koresh back in the United States.

269
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,990
Other factors made some electronics
in response to the allegations.

270
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,480
Child protective services
sent investigators to the
Mountain Carmel Complex.

271
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,650
Their specific brief,

272
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,101
however,

273
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:37,090
was to assess the validity of an
accusation that children had access to.

274
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:38,350
Firearms Koresh,

275
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:38,710
however,

276
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,010
showed that all of the firearms wonder
lock and key and child protective

277
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:42,844
services.

278
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,930
They closed the case in the wake of the
defections Koresh became increasingly

279
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,180
angry and violent towards his followers.

280
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,420
When one woman expressed a
desire to take a child and leave,

281
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,910
he denied her to teach her a lesson.

282
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,043
He rapes her.

283
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,520
Even winslow recounted the incident is
a warning to the congregation at this

284
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,420
time his sermons,

285
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,410
they became darker with the constant
theme of the Coming Day of judgment.

286
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,820
He told his followers that Armageddon
was going to be initiated or right there

287
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,470
at Mount Carmel and so that they have
to be prepared to give up their lives in

288
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:16,690
order to usher in the Davidic Kingdom.

289
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,050
By 1992 Koresh had imbued a siege
mentality into the minds of his followers.

290
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,400
The governmental authorities.

291
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:30,100
They were agents of the devil ends.

292
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:34,390
They were preparing for a cataclysmic
showdown with the true followers have gone

293
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,250
to a hold up at Waco
by divine inspiration.

294
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:41,480
Koresh revealed that he had been
instructed to stockpile weapons at the

295
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:42,314
compounds.

296
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,010
Davidson discovers that the trading
of guns was a lucrative business,

297
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:50,150
providing much needed
funds for the ongoing costs
associated with the compounds.

298
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,960
He would have members buying up cheap
weapons and then selling them at gun trade

299
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:54,710
shows.

300
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,380
Any excess money would be used
to build up that rational.

301
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:57,921
Meanwhile,

302
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:01,580
the information about the presence of
weapons in Mount Carmel had been passed on

303
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,300
by the agents who had visited from
child protective services to the FBI who

304
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:07,520
would in turn given it
to the bureau of Alcohol,

305
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,180
tobacco,

306
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,110
and firearms.

307
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,510
The ATF now began
surveillance of the property.

308
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,860
The situation winds up a notch when the
ups delivery package was seen by agents

309
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,240
to contain hands grenades,

310
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,200
which were illegal.

311
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,100
This discovery led to an eight month
investigation which revealed a trend of

312
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,300
everything from grenade launchers to
assault weapons ending up at Mount Carmel

313
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,100
by early November of 1992.

314
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:31,640
The ATF had amassed enough evidence
to take Koresh into custody.

315
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,410
They will worried though
that his followers,

316
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:36,080
he sincerely believed
that he was the Messiah,

317
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,300
would fight to stop them
from taking him away.

318
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,420
They could have arrested him when
he was in town buying supplies,

319
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,190
but for some reason they chose not to.

320
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,761
Instead,

321
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:47,480
they placed some undercover agents in a
small cabin that was situated right in

322
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,400
front of the entrance to the compounds.

323
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,301
One of the agents,

324
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:54,260
Robert Rodriguez manage to friends members
of the group and get himself invited

325
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:58,010
to a Bible study class where you
could observe Koresh shop close.

326
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,210
The ATF concluded that Koresh was an
imminent danger to society who could

327
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,800
unleash his followers and they're lethal
force upon any target at any time.

328
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,090
They decided that the best course of
action was to stage a raid on his complex.

329
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,520
The date was set for February the 28th,

330
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,031
19,

331
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:14,864
92,

332
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,210
an hour before the raid was
scheduled to go down under cover.

333
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:20,870
Agent Rodriguez went into the compounds
and showed Koresh that morning's copy of

334
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:23,360
a local paper with it's blazing headline,

335
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,410
the Sinful Messiah alongside
a picture of Koresh Koresh.

336
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:30,620
You had already been informed that there
was a buildup of law enforcements and

337
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,120
media around the area told her dri guys
that he knew that the ATF were about to

338
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:36,860
attack upon exiting mounds,

339
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:37,970
Carmel Rodriguez,

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,170
trying to warn his atf bosses that Koresh
already knew about the surprise rate,

341
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,370
but it was too late.

342
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,280
Fully armed agents were already
closing in on the compounds.

343
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,150
To this day,

344
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,360
it remains unclear as to
which side fired first,

345
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:53,150
but within a fist firefight was underway.

346
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,960
Moving 70 ATF officers were
secret ID around the building.

347
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:01,430
While army helicopters cycled above
inside branch Davidian members put fire on

348
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:04,100
the invaders who had come
to take away that Messiah.

349
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,890
The shooting lasted for
more than 60 minutes.

350
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,060
Koresh was hitting the wrist while six
of his followers were shot dead for ATF.

351
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,590
Agents were also killed.

352
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,890
As the fighting continued Koresh
made a phone call to the local police

353
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:18,170
departments urging that
the rate be stopped,

354
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,921
the request,

355
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:22,130
it fell on deaf ears and he hung
up and proceeded to go upstairs.

356
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,620
It was then that he was
wounded a second time.

357
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:25,910
This time more seriously,

358
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,590
the bullet penetrated his hip,

359
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,030
confining them to the floor.

360
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,080
When the shooting ended,

361
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:33,650
the ATF had multiple
casualties and no David Koresh.

362
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,520
The handling of the raid was roundly
condemned leading to intervention by the

363
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,640
FBI with worldwide attention
now focused on Waco.

364
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,450
The new men in charge were determined
to ends the standoff as quickly as

365
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:45,284
possible.

366
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,450
Final battle that Koresh
had been proclaiming for so
many years was now upon his

367
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:58,630
followers with him were
117 of the faithful,

368
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:02,980
including 46 children and nobody
wanted to leave but Koresh sent out 14

369
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:03,530
children,

370
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,830
none of which were his offspring
in the days after the raise Koresh.

371
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,890
His main preoccupation during the siege,

372
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:10,630
which was to last for 51 days,

373
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,850
was to get his message
about the seven seals,

374
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:17,080
sounds the wells the rave had created
a media frenzy and he believed that he

375
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:21,190
could capitalize on the publicity to
get the word out for hours on end.

376
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:24,400
He proselytized over the
phone to FBI negotiators.

377
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,940
Three days after the raid Koresh agreed
to bring out all of his followers.

378
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,460
If you get one of his
sermons ad on the radio,

379
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,460
this was Julie.

380
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,231
You complied with,

381
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:34,870
but Koresh failed to live up
to his side of the bargain,

382
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,830
claiming that God had told him to
hold off until you received further

383
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,664
instruction.

384
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,481
After two weeks,

385
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:40,841
foods,

386
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:44,290
water and milk for the young
children was running dangerously low.

387
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,700
Inside the compounds Koresh told his
followers that the hardship they were

388
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,850
facing was a direct test
of their faith in him.

389
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,480
Things got worse when the FBI caught
off all power to the complex and began

390
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,230
playing loud music and shining blazing
lights throughout the night in order to

391
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:02,980
prevent the branch Davidians from sleeping
still the people inside it would not

392
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:03,550
budge,

393
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,001
crash,

394
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:04,840
and then last thing,

395
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,540
I'll say trickle of people thus far,

396
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,690
but now he angrily declared that no one
else would leave Mount Carmel so long as

397
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:13,840
the government kept up the torments
and increasingly frustrated.

398
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:18,520
FBI now brought in Abrams tanks which
proceeded to smash and destroy all

399
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,320
property outside of the compounds,

400
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,460
including vehicles with the pressure
tactics falling flat to the FBI allowed a

401
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:28,000
defense attorney hazed by Koresh's
mother to go in and talk to his clients.

402
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,870
Gresh told the lawyer that he knew that
the government would not let him live

403
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,650
even though the FBI had offered to arrange
for a worldwide television broadcast

404
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,880
of his message if he promised to come
out is trusting them was shattered and he

405
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,960
refused the offer.

406
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,710
There was a breakthrough of sorts on
April the 14th when Koresh announced that

407
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,880
golden instructed him to write down the
entire message of the seven seals of

408
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,420
when this majestic work was completed.

409
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,080
As promised,

410
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,040
the siege would be over and the
branch Davidians would come out.

411
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,130
The seven seals offer,

412
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,710
however,

413
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,290
was never passed onto us.

414
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,790
Attorney General Janet Reno,

415
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,720
who want April [inaudible]
17 for authorized the plan
to use tanks and tear gas

416
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,720
to bring this to an end.

417
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,470
The end's began at 6:00 AM on April the
19th when an FBI agents phoned Koresh

418
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,470
and told him that tear gas was being
placed in the building by mechanical arms

419
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:21,460
attached to tanks.

420
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,570
He stressed that it was not an assault
and urge the Davidians not to fire their

421
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,240
weapons.

422
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,510
Batang smashed into the
building as it delivered.

423
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:28,961
CS,

424
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:31,390
gas and size of the people were in agony,

425
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,900
unable to breathe and feeling as if
their strikes and the lungs were on fire.

426
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,010
Still maybe came out after
six hours of fire erupted,

427
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,900
which quickly got out of control.

428
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,300
Now surely I'll look his reasons.

429
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,430
Those inside would come out,

430
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,160
but it wasn't to be the fire
raged through the building,

431
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,120
killing 17,

432
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:49,781
nine people,

433
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,100
including 22 children,

434
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,250
Koresh had made his way to the
chapel with the flames closing in.

435
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,870
He died of a gunshot wound to the hat.

436
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,500
Nobody knows whether or not
he claimed his own life.

437
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,750
So I really hope you found
