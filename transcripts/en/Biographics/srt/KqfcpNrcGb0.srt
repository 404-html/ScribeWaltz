1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,710
20 million Soviet citizens died at
his hands for a quarter of a century.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,770
He ruled his huge Ambar
with a ruthless iron.

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:11,250
Fist terror was his modus
operandi while he was alive,

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:11,611
no one,

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,010
not even his closest
family members were safe.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,480
Yet at his passing,

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,030
he was mourn as the savior of his people.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,380
In this week's buying graphics,

9
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,830
we uncover the terrible
truth about Joseph Stalin.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,780
A single death is a tragedy.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,150
1 million deaths is a statistic.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,490
The man who would come to be known as
Joseph Stalin was born in the small

13
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:40,970
Georgian town of glory.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,770
At the time,

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,560
Georgia was part of the
imperial Russian empire.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,800
His date of birth was December the 18th
1878 stolen father of a salary and zero

17
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,581

home producing footwear for the Russian

22
00:00:58,361 --> 00:00:58,900
army.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,550
On his rare appearances at home,

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,110
he would beat his wife and son,

25
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,120
Stalin's mother,

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,380
Catherine,

27
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:03,600
Rena,

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,270
Aussie meted out punishments on the
boy that was generally protective.

29
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:10,540
Often Stalin only learn to speak
Russian when he was nine years old and

30
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,580
throughout his entire life.

31
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,170
He never lost his strong
George and accents installing.

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,360
He was raised in an
atmosphere of violence.

33
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,060
Gorrie was a rough town with organized
street brawling being a popular pass

34
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:20,560
time.

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,700
On February the 13th 1892 the young

36
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:25,510
criminals.

37
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,890
The traumatized child came away with
a hatred of the Cyrus regime style it,

38
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,860
and he was sent to a church school
where he excelled academically.

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,180
He sang in the church choir
and is impressed as teachers
with his intelligence

40
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,014
and his memory.

41
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,260
In 1894 he graduated two
years ahead of schedule.

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,880
Then at the age of 15 he was awarded a

44
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,400
However,

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,030
the team was more taken with the
writings of Marx and Engels and the Bible

46

declaring himself a
Marxist and an atheist.

47
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:58,510
He joins the Russian Social
Democratic Labor Party or RSD LP.

48
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,620
In 1899 stolen was expelled from the
seminary as a result of his Marxist

49
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:07,160
leanings.

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,640
By now.

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,280
He had adopted the
revolutionary pseudonym Koba,

52
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,550
which was the name of George and Robin
Hood type figure for the next two years.

He worked as a clerk at the
titlist metrological observatory.

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,390
During this time he became involved in

In 1901 he relocated to the

58
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,870
Then he was encouraged by
vrs DLP to start up on rest.

59
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,440
He helped to organize a strike in an
oil refinery which led to him being in

60
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:37,520
prisons for this.

61
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,550
He spent 18 months in jail and was then
deported to Siberia over the next 12

62
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,010
years.

63
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,520
Stalin,

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,740
he was arrested six times each time.

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,120
He managed to escape and returns the
West often traveling on forged documents.

66
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,110
He was arrested for the final time in
February of 1913 when was the exile to

67
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:57,320
Tara Hantske the most
inhospitable part of Siberia.

68
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,280
He was there for four these years.

69
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,910
They hardened him and they made him
cynical in 1986 stone in marriages.

70
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,260
First wife Carto is funny.

71
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:05,740
Z.

72
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,240
That's Sun Yaakov was born.

73
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:07,601
The following.

74
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,190
Yeah.

75
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,840
Stolen was often absent,

76
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,380
busy inciting unrest.

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,011
As a result,

78
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,690
his wife and sons or little of him can't
say died of typhus in December of 1907

79
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,140
at the age of 22 there's a funeral stolen.

80
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,090
Declasse this creature
softened my heart of stone.

81
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,220
She has died and it's wither have died.

82
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:27,130
My last warm feelings for humanity stolen,

83
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,820
ignored his son who was brought
up by his in law in later years.

84
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,910
Stalin ordered the arrest and
execution of much of caught his family,

85
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,680
including her brother Alexander,

86
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,640
who had introduced stolen Ricaurte in
1911 style and father to son by his lands

87
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:42,940
lady while living in a
remote Georgia and village.

88
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,820
The by constant team never had
any contact with his father.

89
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,270
In 1983 the RSD LP is
split into two factions.

90
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:54,170
Bolshevik ans Menshevik stolen was an
admirer of the writings of the revolution.

91
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,180
Vladimir Lenin,

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,910
and aligned himself with
the Bolshevik cause,

93
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,030
his work to undermine the Mensheviks
and his involvement in a number of

94
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:05,370
burglaries to raise funds
for the Bolsheviks brought
him to Lennon's attention.

95
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,223
Mm.

96
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,140
Lenin was impressed with Scotland
calling him the wonderful Jordan.

97
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,570
In 1912 he appointed him to the
Bolshevik Central Committee.

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,860
It was at this time that stolen drops is
Georgia and alias Koba and took on the

99
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,850
name Stalin,

100
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,260
meaning man of steel.

101
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,190
The outbreak of war in 1914 accelerated
the collapse of San Nicholas.

102
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,940
The second is rule to
think on the eastern front,

103
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,840
sends the large loss of
areas of territories,

104
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,680
Germany,

105
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,410
along with food shortages
and economic hardship,

106
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,290
took its toll on Russia's
fragile infrastructure.

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,910
Protests and strikes grew in intensity
over the next three years and finally on

108
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,520
march the 15th 1917
the Russian parliament,

109
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,040
the Duma forced a provisional governance,

110
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,450
protests and strikes.

111
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,650
They grew in intensity.

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,940
Over the next three years.

113
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,691
Finally,

114
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,540
on march the 15th 1917
the Russian parliament,

115
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,340
the Duma formed a provisional government
that same day saw Nicholas' abdicated

116
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,460
the 304 year Romanov Dynasty was that
an ends a year later and ordered the

117
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:08,110
merger of the entire Romanov family,

118
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,250
the provisional government,

119
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:09,671
the socialist,

120
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,430
it's mainly the Mensheviks
now ran the country.

121
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,330
The dual power was necessary
as the government needed
the support of the Soviets

122
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,360
who felt unprepared to
take on full power Stalin.

123
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,000
He was still living in Siberia
in x solid during the revolution.

124
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,890
He returns to live in Petrograd.

125
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,340
Well,

126
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,960
he took over the editorship of
the Bolshevik newspaper profit,

127
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,020
which means truth.

128
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,740
The Bolsheviks were a
minority party and stolen,

129
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,410
decided to cooperate with the provisional
government in order to bolster the

130
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,460
parties popularity.

131
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,100
When Lenin returned from European exile,

132
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,320
he marched the revolution
and it's condemned.

133
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:45,550
The new government has imperialistic
and no better from the old regime.

134
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,730
He sends it stolen for
his constellate acid.

135
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,573
You towards it.

136
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,250
As a result,

137
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,630
styling toughened his stance
not only against the government,

138
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,030
it was against other socialist parties.

139
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,680
In July of 1917,

140
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,240
protests against the provisional
government's broke out.

141
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,040
Leading Bolsheviks were arrested but not
Stalin who was considered of listened

142
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,810
importance.

143
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,840
Stalin hid Lennon and helped him
disappear into Finland in late October.

144
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,700
Then resends Patrick grads and,

145
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,030
uh,

146
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,920
just an immediate seizure of power.

147
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:13,441
However,

148
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,590
it moderates within the
party advised restraint,

149
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,191
stolen,

150
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,780
surprisingly sided with them.

151
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,280
Then it however pressed on,

152
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,690
on October the 23rd amazing was health
in which it was voted to undertake an

153
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,770
armed uprising.

154
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,611
Two days later,

155
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,930
the Bolsheviks armed wing led by Leon
Trotsky took control of Petra grasp.

156
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,730
The provisional government was overthrown.

157
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,190
The Soviets had seized power lending,

158
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,630
instituted the new government,

159
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,200
the council of People's Commerce Arts
Starlin was appointed the people's

160
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,680
commissar of nationalities across Russia.

161
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,530
Group's supposed to,

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,970
Lennon's new autocracy joined forces to
remove the Bolshevik governments as the

163
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,230
Russians have war broke out.

164
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:52,220
Stalin was appointed a political commissar
and it's put in charge of the defense

165
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,840
of the city of Sanford sin.

166
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,510
This is the city that would
ultimately become Stalingrad.

167
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,860
He frequently clashed with Trotsky who
had been appointed his military superior.

168
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,120
He wants him prison's a group of Trotsky
supporters on a leaky bodge ans left

169
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,960
them to drown.

170
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,400
The Bolsheviks at this point changed
their name to the Russian Communist Party.

171
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,140
Stalin's rise through this group's ranks
was impressive and he owed it all to

172
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,490
the support of Lennon.

173
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,420
In 1922 Lennon made him general secretary
of the Communist Party's central

174
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,050
committee,

175
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,883
a posty health.

176
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,450
For the rest of his life,

177
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,320
but within a year,

178
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
stolen had fallen out with Lennon,

179
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,271
Georgia.

180
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:26,780
It's Darlene's.

181
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,080
Home State had been promised autonomy
at the time of the revolution,

182
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,230
but that promise had been reneges on
between 1918 and 1921 it's an enjoyed a

183
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,490
period of self rule was in 1922 Lennon
decided to bring us back into the fault.

184
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,070
He wants it the reunion
to be a peaceful one,

185
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,060
but stolen.

186
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,290
He had other ideas.

187
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,910
He cracked down hot,

188
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,930
having the leaders of the
George and rebellion execute
it and then at this point

189
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,730
he was absolutely furious.

190
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,500
But in late 1922 he suffered the first
of a series of strokes which severely

191
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,350
impacted his ability to
command in its estimates,

192
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,120
which was published in November.

193
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,620
He castigated Stalin.

194
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,090
Stalin is too rude.

195
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,090
This defects becomes intolerable
in a secretary general.

196
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,830
That is why I suggest the comrades.

197
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:13,820
Think of a way of removing stolen from
that post and appointing another man in

198
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:14,654
his stat.

199
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,350
Months later,

200
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,890
while Lennon was still hospitalized
style in that phone then and his wife,

201
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,940
who he suspected of feeding her husband's
dislike event and subjected her to an

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,860
avalanche of abuse referring to her in
the conversation as a syphilitic whore.

203
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,300
When Lennon found out about this,

204
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,340
he was unsurprisingly outraged.

205
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,030
Many people actually believe the stress
of the situation precipitated Lennon's

206
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:35,420
death.

207
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,580
About 10 months later
after Lennon's death,

208
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,740
Stalin took the lead in
organizing the funeral,

209
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,600
the pairing as the chief pallbearer.

210
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,560
It was at this point that he
initiated the deification of Lenin,

211
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,840
even renaming Petrograd
as Lennon Grasp Stalin.

212
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,280
He used this opportunity to reinvent
himself as the bearer of Lennon's legacy.

213
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,710
From now on to now,

214
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,470
Stalin was to doubt Lennon

215
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,580
stolons main rival was now
Leon Trotsky and his followers.

216
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,610
The leftist Trotskyites in 1925 style
enforced Trotsky to resign as people's

217
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,840
comments off a wall from now on,

218
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,800
anyone who spoke out against the
secretary general worth risking their very

219
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,700
lives when open opposition broke
out in late 1927 it's tremendous,

220
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,190
including Trotsky was
expelled from the party.

221
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,700
Trotsky was exiled to Kazakhstan men.

222
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,850
1919 stolen,

223
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,980
married his second wife.

224
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,770
Now up,

225
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,790
they had two children,

226
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,220
Vaseline born in 1921 and fed liner,

227
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,710
born in 1926 on the evening of November
the eighth 1932 the couple what?

228
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,130
Hosting a party to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the October Revolution.

229
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,510
They often argued,

230
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,970
and this occasion it was no
difference and that edge,

231
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:44,820
the accused or husbands of being
inconsiderate towards that,

232
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,300
he responded by humiliating
her in front of their guests.

233
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,610
He flicked cigarettes a
ta and to address her is,

234
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,540
hey you,

235
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,350
the following morning sevens found the
Danish to dads have a gunshot wound to

236
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:57,210
the head during the rough and civil war,

237
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,910
Lenina daughter,

238
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,340
the acquisition of the peasants,

239
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,270
grain and livestock,

240
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,490
85% of the Soviet population,

241
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,510
they lived off the land.

242
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,300
He had also ordered the
collectivization of farms.

243
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,540
Peasants perceived as better off
the Kulaks were to be destroyed,

244
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,140
killed,

245
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,973
or to port it.

246
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,820
These measures caused widespread
devastation and eventually famine

247
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,380
lines in his mistake.

248
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,820
Man In in 1921 introduced the new
economic policy to try to improve the

249
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:25,654
situation.

250
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,260
However,

251
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,190
in 1928 style and decided to
reintroduce collectivization,

252
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,720
he aims to achieve this.

253
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,220
Within five years,

254
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,460
anyone who was resisted
was simply put to death.

255
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,550
In December of 1929 stolen announced the
liquidation of the Kulaks as a class or

256
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:46,210
a peasants were encouraged to denounce
the Kulaks who were to be shot on sight

257
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,530
or if they were lucky,

258
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,450
deported to gulags in Siberia.

259
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,500
Stalin sent out armed forces into the
countryside to force villagers into

260
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,220
collectives.

261
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,740
Many of the people had no
knowledge of agriculture.

262
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,460
The Q legs resulted to slaughtering
their own cattle and destroying their own

263
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,940
equipment rather than see it
disappear into the hands of the state.

264
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,050
Terrible famine.

265
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,670
Then in Syria and Ukraine,

266
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,020
it was the worst with up to 10 million
people dying this time was to be

267
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,460
remembered as the killing of hunger.

268
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:12,680
Yeah.

269
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,230
At the state offered no help.

270
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:14,830
In fact,

271
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,000
anyone caught with so much as a handful
of grain was liable to punishment by

272
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:19,720
death.

273
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,481
At the same time,

274
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:20,771
there's this,

275
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:22,180
people were starving to death,

276
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:22,630
stolen,

277
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,630
exported millions of tons
of vitally needed grain in
1931 stolen stated that the

278
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,550
Soviet Union was a hundred
years behind other countries.

279
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,390
Technologically,

280
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,680
they had 10 years to catch up or they
would be crushed by the rest of the world.

281
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,890
His five year plan saw the
birth of new industrial cities.

282
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,850
Within a decade.

283
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:43,450
The Soviet Union had indeed some
hostile nations in terms of industrial

284
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:46,510
developments with the
exception of the United States,

285
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,160
but ordinary Russians.

286
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,470
They fell a new benefit
from stolen successes.

287
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:55,590
Factory workers became fixated on meeting
unrealistic targets if they failed.

288
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,210
They risked the harshest of punishments.

289
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,680
By 1935 uh,

290
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:03,160
million citizens were residing
in Stalin's forced labor camps.

291
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,400
The gulags at the 1934 political congress,

292
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:10,210
a threat to Stalin's absolute power in
merged in the form of Leningrad Party

293
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,280
boss Sergei Kirov stolen,

294
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,380
reacted with a fierce purge of the party.

295
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,470
That's sort of 1,108 that's 56% of the
congress delegates arrested and one third

296
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:21,910
of them execute it.

297
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,100
On September the first 1934 Sergei
Kirov was assassinated outside the party

298
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,270
officer's in Leningrad,

299
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,440
the alleged assassin,

300
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,620
his wife and his 85 year old's
mother will quickly put to death.

301
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,760
Though many people believe that Stalin
himself was behind this assassination,

302
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,391
stolen,

303
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:43,930
seized upon this assassination as
the catalyst for the great terror.

304
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,220
He brought in a new law which deprived
of defendants have any defense.

305
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,970
A number of Moscow show trials were
held nearly all of them resulting in the

306
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,920
death penalty over the next three years,

307
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:57,880
up to 1939 Stalin's purges
became increasingly severe.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,210
He did this for any methodically drawing
up arrest quotas along with numbers to

309
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:04,030
be shot in each district
still over fulfillments.

310
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,140
If this was encouraged,

311
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
people terrified of being denounced got
in with their denunciations first before

312
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,060
the two words announced.

313
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,230
This led to the gulags soon
being overcrowded and new
complexes had to be built

314
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,190
by slave labor.

315
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,000
No one except for Stalin
himself could Trudy and piece.

316
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,410
Many of those in positions of power became
terrified that they too would be next

317
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,380
with some of them are committing suicide
in order to do escape their fate.

318
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,460
The military,

319
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,870
we're not immune to the purchase either.

320
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,900
At the same time that
Hitler was taking me over,

321
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,530
Austria stolen was ordering the execution
of his most able military leaders,

322
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,210
those who survived and became paranoid
of one another during 1939 is Hitler's

323
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:45,211
military muscle flexing pushed Europe
towards war in feared for the safety of

324
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,030
his country.

325
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,220
He looks to Great Britain
as a potential ally,

326
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,800
but prison didn't appear to be
doing much of anything at all.

327
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,270
So when approached by Germany,

328
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:52,750
it stolen,

329
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,710
didn't hesitate.

330
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,110
He signs a nonaggression pact with Hitler.

331
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,550
It declared simply that the Russian and
German people would not take up arms

332
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:01,384
against each other.

333
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,280
This took a great deal
of pressure off stolen

334
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,380
and the summer of 1940
headless subjugation of
Europe seemed unstoppable and

335
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:16,370
less than two weeks is blitzkrieg pans
or armies had rolled through Belgium,

336
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,030
Holland,

337
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,860
and France.

338
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,720
And at this point he began
looking to the east stolen.

339
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:21,170
However,

340
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,080
couldn't believe that the fewer
up would go back on his word,

341
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,070
but on June the 22nd 1941
this is exactly what happens.

342
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,820
Nazi troops crossed the Polish
border and invaded the Soviet Union.

343
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,460
The Soviet leader was
caught totally off guard.

344
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,443
Within a month,

345
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,330
German troops were a hundred
miles from Leningrad.

346
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,750
Smolensk fell on July the 16th ends.

347
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,240
By June the 26 just four days
after the attack had begun,

348
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,180
400,000 Soviet soldiers were trapped
as the German tenses and closed around

349
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:49,730
Minsk,

350
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,890
a key stronghold on route to Moscow.

351
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,880
On June the 29th reports reached Moscow
that the city of mince could fallen.

352
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,580
It was only a week since the
German invasion had begun.

353
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,480
At this rate,

354
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,420
the Germans expected to be
in Moscow within a month.

355
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,760
It was at this point that stolen.

356
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,800
It seemed to finally grasp
the enormity of the disaster.

357
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,270
He raged at his generals,

358
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,900
even reducing the stolid head
of the army's Yaakov to tears,

359
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,910
but then stolen crumbles.

360
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,043
He grinds,

361
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,160
everything's lost.

362
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,550
I give up then and found it all
Allstate and we've screwed it off.

363
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,430
Stolen was driven to his dodger
on the outskirts of Moscow.

364
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,250
He slumped in shock in
his arm chat the next day.

365
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,790
He didn't come into the Kremlin or
responding to phone calls and as absence.

366
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,550
No one dared to make any
decisions or sign any documents.

367
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,460
Suddenly there was a chilling
vacuum at the heart of power.

368
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,790
Historians are divided on
Stalin's mindset during this time.

369
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,930
Some believe that he was
playing a dangerous game
with is in a circle watching

370
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:45,950
and waiting to see who would try to seize
the reins during this time of crisis.

371
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,860
Others are of the opinion that he
gained close to a nervous breakdown.

372
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,040
What style in faced was
not just military to feet,

373
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,640
but the collapse of everything that
he had worked for within Russia.

374
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,361
Finally,

375
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:59,430
on June the 30th the politburo
drove ounce to Stalin's dot.

376
00:15:59,431 --> 00:15:59,870
Shah.

377
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,340
They found him still sitting in his arm.

378
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:01,760
Jack,

379
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,560
he looks up at them,

380
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,681
hi,

381
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:03,620
good and novice,

382
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,520
and he asked,

383
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,720
why have you come?

384
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,130
He suspected a COO,

385
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,100
but the politburo did not
want to overthrow Stalin.

386
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,010
They wanted him to return to the
Kremlin and take charge of the state.

387
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:13,821
Defense Committee.

388
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,950
The Soviet wall cabinets are relieved,

389
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:16,550
stolen,

390
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,710
perhaps that is most
vulnerable ever asked,

391
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,450
can I leave the country to victory?

392
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,640
That may be more deserving candidates.

393
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,660
The reply though,

394
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,530
it came quickly.

395
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,720
There is none more worthy.

396
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,411
Nodding,

397
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:27,950
stolen,

398
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,401
accepted.

399
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,830
His new role as he began
to regain has enough.

400
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,050
Kiev was overrun by September.

401
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,080
Stalin's advises had begged him
to evacuate the deemed city.

402
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,130
However he refused and more than half
a million people were either killed or

403
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,380
taken prisoner centrally for a scapegoat.

404
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,840
Stolen blames the prisoners themselves.

405
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,360
All prisoners of war he
declared were traitors.

406
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,890
Those who resounds after the war were
sent directly to labor camps when his son,

407
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:56,120
by his first marriage Yaakov was taken
prisoner of the Nazis approached style

408
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:59,810
and about trading him for some
of their own and Cynthia replied,

409
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,700
but he had no son by that name.

410
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,620
Yaakov was shot and killed by outside
of the gym and sweat perilously close to

411
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,190
Moscow.

412
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,500
The government's moved 500 miles away,

413
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,400
but Stalin,

414
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,490
he decided to stay attending
a parade on Red Square.

415
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,900
On November the seventh the tank strove
Posten and onto the front lines just 25

416
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,340
miles outside of the city.

417
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,420
The Soviet troops fought valiantly and
the Russian Windsor began to cripple the

418
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,010
German forces in the ends.

419
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,850
The Nazis were unable to solidify their
gains and as they were steadily beaten

420
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:29,330
back,

421
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,930
stolen.

422
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,300
Also wisely teamed up with the allies
will install in Churchill and Roosevelt.

423
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,110
Matt at the Toronto Conference in 1943
Joseph Stalin was reintroduced to the

424
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,420
west as kindly uncle Joe.

425
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,330
By 1945 the Soviets had won the war,

426
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,290
but the cost,

427
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,760
it was enormous.

428
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,820
More than 25 million Soviets had
died six times as many as in Germany.

429
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Stalin vowed that he would never let
Russia be this vulnerable again of the

430
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:57,631
Yalta Conference.

431
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,810
In 1945 the allies match to
discuss the postwar world.

432
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,190
Stalin made it clear that eastern
Europe was to remain under his control,

433
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,150
Britain and the USA.

434
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:06,660
However,

435
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,480
we're not happy with Stalin's
actions in eastern Europe.

436
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,590
Winston Churchill famously declared that
an iron curtain had descended across

437
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,390
the continent and with that,

438
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,740
the Cold War began

439
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,780
back home.

440
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,020
Stalin was even more popular than before.

441
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,620
Grateful Russians hopes that the great
victory overhead low would sweep clean

442
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:28,640
the misery of the past.

443
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,720
Unfortunately,

444
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,230
however,

445
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,820
the war had Millie
distracted not to changed.

446
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,770
Joseph Stalin,

447
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,660
even though the crowds adored him,

448
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,970
he was convinced that
everyone was out to get him.

449
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,910
Thousands of returning soldiers
were sent to labor camps.

450
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,670
Many Jewish intellectuals and doctors
were tried and killed on style.

451
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,370
The 70th birthday in 1949 images of the
grades leader we're projected into the

452
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:53,090
skies over Moscow is all
seeing eye was omnipresence,

453
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,410
but the ravages of old age.

454
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,870
We're beginning to catch up
with him after a great feast.

455
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:01,871
On February the 28th of 1953 Joseph Stalin
had a paralyzing stroke over the next

456
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:02,750
few days.

457
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,340
He slowly suffocated to death.

458
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Joseph Stalin died on the morning of
March the fifth 1953 his funeral was an

459
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,490
orgy of grief.

460
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,810
Soviet to simply couldn't imagine going
on without their gaunt and father,

461
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,100
but go on.

462
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,080
They did three years after Stalin's death,

463
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,190
his eventual replacement,

464
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,480
Nikita Khrushchev gave an extraordinary
speech at a closed session of the 20th

465
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,410
Party Congress.

466
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,080
He said that while Stalin
had been a great leader,

467
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,380
he had also committed terrible
crimes against the Soviet people.

468
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,360
The Myth of the benevolence protective
comrade leader was finally reveals for

469
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:35,541
what?

470
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,970
It actually was a terrible lie.

471
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,850
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

472
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,691
