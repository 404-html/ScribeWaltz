1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,140
His computer generated voice has become
familiar to generations of people

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:08,190
instantly garnering recognition
as the words of a genius.

3
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:12,300
His name is answered in the same breath
as Einstein and Galileo and he had a few

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:15,810
people can understand the
complexities of his theories.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,380
What they do know though is that Stephen
Hawking overcame physical obstacles

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:24,381
that would have defeated many people
and he did that in order to pursue his

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,400
passions.
In the process,

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,750
he became an inspiration to millions and
added greatly to our understanding of

9
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:32,850
the universe.
In this week's biographics,

10
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:37,380
we undertake a brief history of Stephen
Hawking and just before we get started

11
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,070
with the video to that,

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,920
do you want to say it but it's brought
to you by the great courses plus the

A little later in this video,

21
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,760
Steven William Hawking was born at the
height of the Second World War on January

22
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,820
the eighth 1842 in Oxford,
England.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,260
It was exactly 300 years after the
death of the father of astronomy.

24
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,520
Galileo Galilei. Both of his parents
were graduates of Oxford University.

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,360
There's father frank was
a medical researcher while
his mother Isabel worked as

26
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,460
a medical research secretary.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,450
They were a middle class family with
both parents being thought of in their

28
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,720
community as rather old brain boxes.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,350
Steven began his schooling at
Byron. How School? Then high gate,

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,340
the school used a new progressive method
of teaching to which Steven did not

31
00:01:59,341 --> 00:01:59,880
take.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,440
He stayed here for three years though and
by the age of eight he could still not

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,910
read at the war's end.

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,110
Frank was offered a job at the National
Institute of Medical Research and the

35
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,150
family moved to St Albans.
Yeah.

36
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:16,530
Frank wanted his son to attend
the prestigious Westminster
School. How are the,

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,150
Steven was sick on the day of the entrance
exam and he ended up going to nearby

38
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,770
St Albans school instead.

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,580
Steven at this school he
was seen as a nerdy outcast.

40
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,720
He was small and skinny and he spoke
with a list but that made it hard to

41
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,680
understand what he was saying.
For the first two years of his time there,

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,870
he was very much a loner.
In the third year,

43
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,640
he managed to find a small group of
like minded friends that are extra

44
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:44,470
curricular activities included going on
long bike rides and didn't venting board

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,660
games.
Steven,

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,040
he proved to be the most inventive and
creative of this group and we'd come up

47
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,610
with the rules and organize the
state of play in these games.

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,700
Steven has two younger sisters and a
brother who was adopted in 1955 however it

49
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,710
is. Parents showed little interest
in domestic affairs. The walking,

50
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,760
the house was filled with books and
the parents were too busy feeding their

51
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,361
minds.

52
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,230
Often reading books during dinner rather
than conversing with their children.

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,370
Steven regularly had his friends over
where they would busy themselves building

54
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:20,170
model planes and electronic devices.
From about the age of 12 onwards,

55
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,440
that discussions extended
from science to religion.

56
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,670
They debated the big questions of life
among themselves and it was at this time

57
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,140
that Steven began forming his
atheistic beliefs. Stephen's teachers,

58
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,820
they soon identified a remarkable talent
for mathematics and physics in him.

59
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,840
He seems to intuitively know the answers
without having to work through the

60
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:45,220
problem. By the age of 14 he knew that
he wanted to specialize in physics.

61
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:49,030
He felt that he could provide an insight
into the big questions that he and his

62
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,470
friends had been grappling with.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,850
Where are we in a row from why we
are here and where we're going?

64
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,520
At the age of 17 Stephen felt ready to
take the entrance exam for university

65
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:06,420
college at Oxford.

66
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
The exam was extremely challenging
consisting of five papers and the general

67
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:10,914
knowledge exam.

68
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,990
Walking came out with a
score of 95% once again,

69
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:19,830
the he found himself as an outsider
at this prestigious place of learning.

70
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,160
He had no friends and so he
kept to himself. Furthermore,

71
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,670
he found the lectures to be too
basic for him, which they boredom.

72
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,240
He stopped going to many of them
and still easily pastors exams.

73
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,620
The only lectures that he got any
intellectual challenge from where those

74
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,570
presented by his physics tutor,

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Robert Berman Hawking was well ahead of
his fellow students despite being much

76
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:42,870
younger than many of them.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,920
His knowledge was so advanced that he
occasionally made corrections in the very

78
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:50,070
textbooks that he was studying.
At the end of his second year,

79
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,730
he easily won the university
physics prize. Well, as Oxford,

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,330
Stephen took up the sport of rowing.
Rowing was and still is,

81
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:01,770
a very serious business
at Oxford University and
Steven threw himself into it

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,040
with complete commencements.
He became a coxswain.

83
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,740
The person who yells
instructions to the rowers.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,360
He simply loved the thrill of going,
doing his team to success.

85
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,430
It was as involvement in the rowing team,

86
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:18,120
which allowed Stevens a breakout of
his isolation and develop some budding

87
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:18,840
friendships.

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,530
By the time that his old schoolmates
from since albums turn diapers freshmen.

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,460
They were surprised to discover that
the awkward Biver they knew had become a

90
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:30,240
confident young man who had found a
comfortable niche for himself at Oxford.

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,751
In fact,

92
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,590
he became so immersed in the social life
of his environment and that despite his

93
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,424
innate ability,

94
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,720
he began to fall back academically
with his third year exams approaching.

95
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,180
He quickly realized that
he was not fully prepared.

96
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,960
He decided that his best about where's
to focus solely on the theoretical

97
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,140
problems that he could solve
using his innate skill.

98
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,700
The results of the exam had em teetering
between a first and second class honors

99
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,240
degree.

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,600
He needed it to be first class in order
to gain admittance to Cambridge where

101
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,840
any plans to begin his work on his phd.

102
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,720
The result depended on a final oral exam,

103
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:06,440
which she haste gaining fest costs on
us before heading off to Cambridge,

104
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,080
Hawking's took a trip to
Iran with the friends.

105
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,180
He began Cambridge in October of 1962
while he had been expecting to work

106
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:17,360
directly under the guidance
of the famous astronomer Fred.

107
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,480
How this was actually not to be the case.

108
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,650
He was disappointed to find out that
it's tuna was actually Dennis Schema.

109
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,500
The reality of the situation was the,

110
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:30,590
the organ was actually better off on
the ski mom who had more time to go to

111
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:35,330
students than Hoyle would have had
hawking specialized in the study of

112
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:40,160
cosmology. There was, now that he faced
his first real intellectual challenge,

113
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,240
he quickly realized that his mathematical
knowledge was not deep enough for him

114
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:49,241
to really get to grips
with the complications of
Einstein's general theory of

115
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,084
relativity.

116
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,840
At about this time, hawking began to
experience some physical abnormalities.

117
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,400
His speech was starting to slur and he
was prone to losing his balance when he

118
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,160
returns home for the
1962 Christmas holidays.

119
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,820
His parents were so concerned that
they sent him to a specialist.

120
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,320
A series of tests were undertaken and
then it was simply a matter of waiting for

121
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,790
the results.
In the meantime,

122
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,360
hawking attended in New Year's Eve party
where he met a young lady by the name

123
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,970
of Jane Wilde. Jane who was
attracted to the eccentric? Yeah,

124
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,320
intellectual and the two struck
up an immediate attraction.

125
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,730
Steven had already returned to Cambridge
when the results of the test came

126
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:36,690
through. He had developed a als which
is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

127
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,310
It's a condition in which the body's
cells to generate causing paralysis and

128
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,460
muscle atrophy. Yes. While
the body deteriorates,

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,380
the brain is unaffected,

130
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,240
so hawking now at the prospect of being
trapped within a dysfunctional body.

131
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,860
The prognosis related to hawking was
that he had just two years to live.

132
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,820
The symptoms that he experienced and
the first few months were weakness.

133
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:02,580
Stammering while speaking and
having trouble swallowing.

134
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,550
Hawking later reflected on
his feelings at the time,

135
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,560
a disease which can never be hills.

136
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,490
I'm in the clutches of the disease
which is calling me closer to my death.

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,120
The thought itself used to bring
cramps or fear in the stomach.

138
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,290
Why have I only then
caught by Jess disease?

139
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,220
Stephen's doctors and his parents
advised him to continue his studies at

140
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:23,880
Cambridge.

141
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,170
They believe that staying focused on
the goal of achieving his phd would help

142
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:32,070
him to cope with the pain and frustration
of dealing with this failing body,

143
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,910
but Hawkings struggled with the idea
that he was working so hard for a reward

144
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,460
that he would probably
not live to receive.

145
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,480
What was the points is the question that
kept dancing around in the back of his

146
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,080
brain.

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,340
It has been reported that hawking fell
into a deep depression at this time.

148
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:50,610
He was spending his days drinking and
listening to Wagner and a student flats.

149
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,390
However, the man himself actually
later denied this a session.

150
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,140
He certainly went into a period
of confusion and lack of focus,

151
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:01,860
but he also did his best to continue
with the studies. After a year,

152
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,240
his symptoms had stabilized and
his spirits began to pick up.

153
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,340
It was also this time that he picked
up his relationship with Jane Wilde.

154
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,860
He became a great supporter
and encourager of him.

155
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,270
It was she who gave him a glimmer
of hope for a brighter future.

156
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,390
The two became engaged in October of 1964
Jane had committed herself to looking

157
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,380
after Steven for the rest of his life,

158
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,620
and they were married on July the 14th
1965 after two years of living with the

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,660
disease,
hawking was able to get around on a cane.

160
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,480
Though this speech was becoming
increasingly unintelligible,

161
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,130
he was still searching for an area
of focus for his thesis. Fred Hoyle,

162
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:40,050
who is just pronounced his theories
on the discovery of the universe,

163
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,930
and hawking believed the
coils theory was flawed,

164
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,120
and he publicly challenged these theories.

165
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,970
He then proceeded to write
his thesis on the topic,

166
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:50,550
and it was well received
by the cosmology community.

167
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,560
It was this that really established
talking as a player of note in the field

168
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,400
after graduating from Cambridge with
a phd in Applied Mathematics and

169
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:09,150
theoretical physics applied
for and received a fellowship.

170
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,410
It's Cambridge is gone,
villain keys college. This
provided him with a secure job,

171
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,050
which gave him further
confidence in his future. Yes,

172
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,230
his condition had now reached the
stage where he could no longer. Right.

173
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:22,170
So he had to rely on Jane
to record his thoughts.

174
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,370
Hawkings job at the college required him
to supervise students for a few hours

175
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:30,150
every day, providing him with plenty
of time to pursue his research studies.

176
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,780
He and Jane set up that home and a
small house not far from the college.

177
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,080
They enjoyed entertaining friends and
the house was often filled with dinner

178
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:37,710
guests.

179
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,060
In December of 1965 hawking was invited
to the United States to give an address

180
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,860
or to Miami conference.
However,

181
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,970
his speech was so slurred that a friend
had to read the address on his behalf.

182
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,800
The speech,
though it was well received.

183
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,540
Further cementing is growing reputation
as an exciting new thinker in the world

184
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,380
of cosmology. Mom Jane spends a lot of
time and effort caring for her husbands.

185
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,350
She had given up on our own career
when the couple have had maths.

186
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,750
She was in the midst of a
degree in modern languages.

187
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,520
She completed that
degree in 1967 that year.

188
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,390
She also gave birth to their first child.
Robert.

189
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,220
Two more children would follow Blue Lucy
in 1970 and Timothy in 1979 the birth

190
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,590
of his first child was a
further motivated for Hawkings.

191
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:20,670
He look positively toward
the future despite the fact
that he's already outlived

192
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,870
his initial prognosis.

193
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,520
He had a family now along with a promising
career is a budding genius. In fact,

194
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,940
some were even already calling
him the success at Einstein.

195
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,383
Yeah,

196
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,980
the turning points in Hawking's Korea.

197
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,120
Cause when he attended a lecture by
mathematician Robert Penn rose in the

198
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,511
address,

199
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:46,410
Penrose expounded his theory of space
time singularity in the center of a black

200
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,420
hole. Okay. Latched on to the pen,

201
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:52,080
raised singularity theory and
applied it to the entire universe.

202
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,400
If he could prove the
mathematics behind it,

203
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,240
he knew that this would
be a momentous addition.

204
00:11:57,241 --> 00:12:01,530
Do you the understanding of the origins
of the universe mathematics was hawking

205
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:02,291
strong points.

206
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:06,490
So he collaborated with
Penrose who presented his
calculations by way of visual

207
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,120
representations in order to help
hawking who was unable to recall the

208
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,320
calculations himself.

209
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,540
The Big Bang theory was predicated on the
idea that the universe was not static,

210
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,080
but actually it continually expanding.
According to this theory,

211
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,010
the universe began as a black hole.
It was held together by gravity,

212
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,980
Viagra at the center of the holy.

213
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:29,410
It was extremely hot and does it
cooled over billions of years.

214
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,900
It started to expand with the protons,

215
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,901
neutrons and electrons forming the
stars and the galaxies which make up our

216
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:41,200
visible universe. Hawking. He was not
the originator of this new theory,

217
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:45,970
but his work such as the
essay singularities and the
geometry of space time gave

218
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,860
it a strong underpinning.

219
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,030
By the ends of the 1960s Hawking's,

220
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:59,780
als had deteriorated to the point
where he had become wheelchair bound.

221
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,420
The intense speed of his mental cognition,
however,

222
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:05,690
caused him to move around with
maximum speed in its we'll chat.

223
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,400
It also caused him to quickly become
impatient and irritable with those around

224
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,410
him.
Despite his raw temperaments,

225
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:16,670
IEM actually became very popular with
students and colleagues alike and the

226
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,671
early 1970s hogging took on the task of
reconciling the two opposing theories

227
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:24,830
that had divided physics for years.

228
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:28,520
Quantum mechanics and relativity.
During his work,

229
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,950
he discovered that black holes in it,
radiation.

230
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,980
He published this finding in
an article in nature magazine.

231
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,020
There was initially
some push back to this,

232
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:38,240
but eventually his finding was accepted.

233
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,910
Then that came to be known
as hawking radiation.

234
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,230
The discovery of black hole radiation
was a big deal and it led to publicity

235
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:46,880
beyond the scientific community.

236
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,380
Working with now receiving general
media attention giving rise to the fame,

237
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,650
which would see him lauded
as the wheelchair genius.

238
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,560
In 1973 hawking published his first book,

239
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:00,480
the large scale structure of space time.

240
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,760
The following year or read 32 he became
one of the youngest people to become a

241
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,510
member of the Royal Society
in 1974 B with salsa.

242
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:12,360
We invited to spend a year at the
California Institute of Technology. Yeah.

243
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,350
He was able to make use of
the very best equipment,

244
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:19,760
including the jet propulsion laboratory
that is attached to the institute during

245
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,810
his year in America.

246
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:25,640
He was able to work alongside
famous American theoretical
physicist, kept thorn.

247
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,540
The Hawkins family thoroughly enjoyed
their year in Sunny California.

248
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,350
Over the years.

249
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,770
Steven would frequently return to
Caltech to make you sit there advanced

250
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:38,150
facilities. At the end of that time in
the u s the family returned to Cambridge.

251
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:40,790
Where have they moved into a bigger
house on the college grounds.

252
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,200
In 1976 the students in residents by
the name of Don page joins the hawking

253
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:45,940
households.

254
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,880
Paige would walk walking to this
office every morning and perform other

255
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,860
caretaking jobs.
Around this time,

256
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Jane began to feel confined by her life
as a mother and a wife to a wheel chair,

257
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:01,220
bound husbands with page now on hand
to help out with Steven's Kashi embarks

258
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:05,540
upon a phd in medieval Spanish poetry.
Once she gained did,

259
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,120
she began teaching at
Cambridge University.

260
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,300
The couple began experiencing marital
problems from the mid 1970s one cause of

261
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:18,680
their discord was the wildly divergent
religious views that each health Jane was

262
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,100
a committed Christian welp Steven.
He was a confirmed atheist.

263
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,160
The relationship remained strained until
the divorce in 1995 in 1976 or hawking

264
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:32,450
was invited to a number of conferences
around the United States following which

265
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,580
he ended up on TV. Talk shows though
his speech was difficult to understand.

266
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,530
He did prove hips with American audiences.

267
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,390
In 1979 hawking was appointed Lucchese
and professor of mathematics at Cambridge.

268
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,470
This position brought great prestige with
the couple now being the center of the

269
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:49,820
Cambridge social elite.

270
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,510
Hawking enjoyed attending concerts
and movies and despite his physical

271
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:57,770
limitations, he was enjoying his
life more than ever before. Still,

272
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,310
he became disappointed at the back of
facilities for handicapped people in the

273
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:04,160
community and became an advocate
for disabled facilities.

274
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,440
In 1983 a BBC horizon documentary gave
TV viewers and insight into the private

275
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,970
life of the wheelchair genius.

276
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,570
This went a long way in
promoting his celebrity status.

277
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,860
In 1984 he put out several feelers to
publishing houses to write a definitive

278
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:21,290
book of his theories for a lay audience.

279
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,330
Bantam publishing offered him a
$250,000 advance. It took four years.

280
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:29,360
Do you produce the book,
which is called a brief history of time.

281
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,280
It became an instant best seller and
to date has sold more than 10 million

282
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,030
copies.

283
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,030
In July of 1985 hawking was in Geneva
when he found himself unable to breathe.

284
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,690
After arriving in the hospital,
he underwent tracheotomy
surgery. The surgery.

285
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,650
It was a success,
but the payoff was that he lost his voice.

286
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,820
The challenge was now how to provide
hawking with a way to communicate with the

287
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:57,080
world, and this was solved by a
computer programmer by the name of Walt.

288
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,370
Walt halls has equalizer program allowed
hawking to select words from a screen

289
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,850
that would then be converted
into a voice synthesizer

290
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,110
from the early 1980s onwards or walking
had employed fulltime nurses by the end

291
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,160
of the decade. He had become
alarmingly close to one of them.

292
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:19,990
A woman by the name of Alain Mason.

293
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,790
She was a woman with a dominant since
protective personality in early 1990

294
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:29,490
hawking told Jane that he was leaving
the family home and moving in with Elaine

295
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,860
Mason with herself,
married to a family friend at that time,

296
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,660
Hawking Institute of divorce proceedings
to officially end his marriage to Jane.

297
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,800
When the divorce came through in 1995 he
and Elaine were married in the ensuing

298
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:46,060
years that were rumors that Elaine was
physically controlling and abusive to her

299
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:50,070
husband's. After 11 years, the
marriage ended in autobiography.

300
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,130
Hawking referred to you his years with
Elaine as passionate and tempestuous.

301
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,920
In the 1990s hawking became
interested in time travel.

302
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,090
He was of the opinion that
the only possible way for
time travel to exist would

303
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:06,180
be if it did not alter the status quo.
In other words,

304
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,880
if a time travel machine could
be created in the future,

305
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,230
people would only be able to travel back
until the time when that machine was

306
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:17,610
created because prior to that time,
the machine did not exist. Many people,

307
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:21,840
they rejected Hawkings ideas on time
travel and in order to prove his point in

308
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:24,510
an irreverent way,
he decided to hold a party,

309
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:28,020
which was I even do anyone and
serve free food and champagne.

310
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,280
The catch was that he only advertise
the events after it had occurred.

311
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,070
So only time travelers
would be aware of it. Um,

312
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:39,570
surprisingly though no one turns up and
the early two thousands hawking focused

313
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:43,920
on publishing more popular books starting
with 2000 and one's the universe in a

314
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,880
nutshell. And in 2005 he put
out a brief history of time,

315
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,990
both of which were best sellers
by then his iconic status.

316
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:55,530
It was well established to being cemented
with appearances on the Simpsons and

317
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,180
star Trek.
The next generation.

318
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,010
By 2005 Hawkings condition
had deteriorated to the
extent that he could only

319
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,460
control his speech controls with
movements of his cheek muscles.

320
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,780
From 2009 he could no longer move his
electric wheelchair himself and his

321
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,730
breathing became increasingly difficult.

322
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The end came peacefully on the morning
of March the 14th 2018 it was the 139th

323
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:27,210
anniversary of the birth
of Albert Einstein.

324
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,530
The Stephen Hawking was a professor at
one of the best universities in the world

325
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:35,400
since he was a man who
shared his knowledge with
the world through books that

326
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:39,110
can be understood by everyday folks and
that's why I'm particularly pleased that

327
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,200
the great courses plus is involved with
today's video on their learning platform.

328
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:47,670
You can learn from Ivy League professors
and others as they give lectures online.

329
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,750
These can be a great way to learn about
some of the concepts that hawking works

330
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:55,290
on, infusing lectures about
black holes and quantum physics,

331
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,720
but there's also plenty of other stuff
on there from history to travel to help.

332
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,550
Basically it's really
a university education,

333
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:07,080
but it's at your own pace with no tests
and no schedules and it's also very easy

334
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,830
to access. You can do it on your PC,
on your tablet, even on your phone.

335
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,520
They've even recently added streaming
so you can listen on the move.

336
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,690
Something I particularly love,

337
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:19,110
I just pop the audio in when I'm
walking around or going for a jog.

338
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,310
And on the platform there are currently
10,000 lectures that you can choose from.

339
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,180
So yeah,

340
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,600
it's all great stuff and the best way
to find that out is to try for yourself.

341
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,560
And you can do that for free by going
to the great courses plus.com forward

342
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:35,700
slash biographics or simply clicking
the link in the description below.

343
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:40,080
And doing that does help support this
show getting more biographics out to you

344
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,420
every week. So again,
the great courses plus,

345
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,720
it's just a great way to expand your
knowledge on a whole range of subjects

346
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,140
taught by the in the wells. And as always,
I really hope you enjoyed the video.
