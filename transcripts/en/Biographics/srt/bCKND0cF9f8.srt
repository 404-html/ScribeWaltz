1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,400
Just before you started with this one,

2
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:04,490
I do want to say that there's going
to be some French pronunciations,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,720
not a French speaker.

4
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:07,130
I am doing my best though.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,310
George Washington Simon Boulevard even
punch through via the names of the Great

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,350
North and South American revolutionaries.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,780
Remain globally famous
centuries on this one.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,890
Great new wells,

9
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,620
redell many of forgotten he was a nobody.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,120
He became a somebody only
after 50 years of obscurity,

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,210
a freed slave who wound up leading the
only successful large scale slave revolt

12
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:32,720
in history.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,430
The general who made Haiti the second
free colony in the whole of the Americas.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,650
His name was too,

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,010
so the river tour,

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Aka the Black Napoleon born into
slavery over to his early life,

17
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:50,690
was an inspiring tale of overcoming
a racist system to live a free man,

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,220
but it was his later years that were truly
remarkable as he kept on rising until

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:59,690
he became ruler of the society that had
enslaved them and enlightened thinker,

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,210
a prescient philosopher and a
brilliant general that over to you.

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,610
I was also a man who dared to dream
of freedom even if he wouldn't live.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,620
To see those dreams fulfilled,

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,150
this is the story of the greatest
black revolutionary who ever lived

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,200
imagined.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
History is a vast cave,

26
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,590
swelling with shadows,

27
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,040
and each person's life is a distant torch.

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,160
Some of those lives like Napoleon's,

29
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:40,940
a gigantic pyres burning so brightly
that you can't possibly miss them,

30
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,923
but others,

31
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,860
most of them a little
more than matchsticks,

32
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,190
almost invisible.

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,570
It's into this category,

34
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:51,200
the early life of two song
that ever true or false,

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,550
remarkably for a man who would go
on to liberate an entire nation,

36
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:57,950
we know almost nothing about him.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,590
We can say for certain that he was
born in the French colony of Sandman,

38
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,030
now known as Haiti and
1741 just slave parents.

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,590
We can also say that his original name
was to som Breda off to his plantation,

40
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,550
but beyond that,

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,880
everything is a myth and shadow the life
of a slave and sandy was not pretty.

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,260
Ninety percent of the population lived
in shackles while a few tens of thousands

43
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,030
of whites and fried collards,

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,820
as they were known existed
in a state of luxury.

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,840
The average slave life
expectancy was only 21 years.

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,330
Those who downs tools
fought back or ran away,

47
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:37,331
could expect to be blinded or
mutilators yes to Seoul was lucky.

48
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,480
One of the consistent themes of the
conflicting accounts of his early years is

49
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,740
that he was born onto the plantation
of a relatively enlightened master.

50
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,750
The wound you saw taught him French,

51
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,040
allowed him to gain some medical knowledge
and promoted him to a job as a horse

52
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,940
trainer in 1776.

53
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,210
He even granted to song is freedom.

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,090
It's at this point to solemn
briefly resends to the historical.

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,590
He married and had two
kids and it's remarkably.

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,450
He even though disliked the own after
this 15 more years passed in which to saw

57
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,050
left,

58
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,050
not even the slightest footprint on
history by the time 1791 rolled around,

59
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:18,181
he was 50 and age at which most normal
biographies are starting to wind down by

60
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,030
50.

61
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,180
Napoleon had already
conquered half of Europe,

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,420
been defeated at Waterloo,

63
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,250
and then send him to exile by comparison
to Sony was a small time farmer,

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,240
may ember in that dark cave
of history that's on a diesel,

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,430
had every reason to believe he was
going to die and nothing but obscurity.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,410
Thankfully for our story though,

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,910
winds of change were starting to blow
in Europe in no time at all to song and

68
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,290
everyone in Santa Monica would be
consumed by the oncoming hurricane.

69
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,530
In 1799,

70
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,181
a group of friends,

71
00:03:55,181 --> 00:04:00,181
radicals unknowingly lit the fuse on
a gigantic pile of dynamite marked the

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:01,770
French revolution.

73
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,820
The ensuing explosion would
shake up human history.

74
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,631
In most cases,

75
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:09,810
the effects will be felt until
a few years down the line,

76
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,030
but Sandman wasn't most cases.

77
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:17,031
It was a radical tinderbox barely kept
in check by far away Paris almost as soon

78
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,840
as the French Revolution spock's the
entire country went up in flames.

79
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,800
By mid 17,

80
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,550
91,

81
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,550
everyone was aware of the storming of
the Bastille and the declaration of the

82
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:30,270
rights of man.

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,380
This was a problem because the declaration
was pretty clear that the rights of

84
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:34,651
men,

85
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,730
what universal,

86
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:36,780
which in Santa Mom,

87
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,880
they pretty clearly we're not
the wide stumped on the colors.

88
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,100
He dumped on the freed blacks.

89
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,560
He dumped on the slaves
with the whole system,

90
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:46,410
designed as a pyramids of exploitation.

91
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,510
If everyone was suddenly equal,

92
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,170
sound among would cease
to exist for whites.

93
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,450
The French revolution represented both
a threat and the chance to speak less

94
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,350
often declare a white supremacist
republic for the college.

95
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,950
It represented a chance to
finally knock the winds down,

96
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,240
a peg or two that year.

97
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,510
The two sides were almost
openly potting revolts.

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,171
In doing so,

99
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:10,710
they failed to realize that a much larger
group had seen in the revolution and

100
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,570
even bigger chance than they did out on
the plantations and in the darkness of

101
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:16,321
the forests,

102
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:20,310
black slaves had began whispering
to one another by the summer.

103
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,560
The whispers that turned into an idea,

104
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,750
which in turn became a plan.

105
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,560
Finally,

106
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,520
on the night of August,

107
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:27,031
the 14th,

108
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:27,481
17,

109
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:27,931
91,

110
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:32,931
a group of slaves met outside the
capital of lcap performed a secret voodoo

111
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,160
ceremony that are under the stars.

112
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:38,070
They swore by blood to do the unthinkable.

113
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,460
They agreed to results if
the French revolution started
small before snowballing

114
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,210
into an unstoppable avalanche,

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,360
the Haitian Revolution went straight to
the annihilating wall of ice and theory.

116
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,710
On August the 25th thousands of white
plantation owners were woken by gangs of

117
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,590
slaves dragging them from their beds,

118
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,483
stabbing them,

119
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,323
shooting them,

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,410
beating them to death.

121
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,480
French children were dismembered.

122
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,720
Their heads displayed on poles
outside of their former homes.

123
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,800
Fires were started.

124
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,890
Entire plantations bend to the grounds,

125
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,940
the horizon,

126
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,010
the turns and apocalyptic read.

127
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,450
The bloodshed was nearly worse.

128
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:17,980
The freed slaves in the countryside
and the house slaves in the towns that

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
intended to coordinate the uprising,

130
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:24,290
but the field slaves jumped the gun
and the whites and colors were able to

131
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,330
rounds up and massacre the town's slaves,

132
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,520
but it only put off the inevitable.

133
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,420
By late September,

134
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:33,920
over 100,000 slaves were in revolt
and the cap was flooded with refugees.

135
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,740
Carrying horror stories
of rape and mutilation,

136
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,320
the Haitian revolution it had begun,

137
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,440
so where was to solve in all
of this while he was lying low,

138
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,340
refusing to either join the
uprising or to condemn it,

139
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,180
something he was simply waiting to see
if the revolt was going to burn out.

140
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,170
Others think he was giving his
distance in case of white reprisals.

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,220
Whatever the reason is,

142
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:55,820
September into October,

143
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:59,270
and the fires grew until the countryside
looked like a vision of hell.

144
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,270
Fifty year olds to song
finally made his choice.

145
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,751
First,

146
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,120
he shipped his wife and
children off to Santa Domingo,

147
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,950
the Spanish colony occupying the other
half of the islands today known as the

148
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,160
Dominican Republic.

149
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,450
Then he quietly smuggled his old wide
master and his family onto a boat headed

150
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,720
for the USA at lost with
no one left to care for.

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,540
He freed,

152
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,190
slave,

153
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,460
abandoned his farm and
disappeared into the forest.

154
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,520
It was the start of what would
become a remarkable career,

155
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,750
but not straight away because of
his medical knowledge to songs.

156
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,600
First posting was less black
and Napoleon and more male.

157
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,650
Florence Nightingale,

158
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,570
a doctor for Georgia Bay ourselves.

159
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,320
Slave Amit,

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,180
he kept out of the thick of the fighting
as 70 91 raged on and the bodies began

161
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,830
to pile high by the year's end,

162
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,740
some 4,000 whites and
15,000 blacks with debt.

163
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,150
The economy was in ruins.

164
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:48,650
The plantations were husks,

165
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,710
and a third of Omar was in the hands of
the rebellious slaves by the time 1792.

166
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:58,610
Dawn's though to song was finally
beginning to show his promised given 600

167
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,360
minutes of commands,

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
he quickly proved such an effective
fighter that is ranks ballooned to 4,000,

169
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,060
although we're still answering to buy
or sell now effectively had his own army

170
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,790
among their number was Jacques,

171
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Jack Dslr,

172
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,330
a runaway slave who would become
two songs and right on men.

173
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,740
While two songs on the gained fame for
showing clemency to any whites they

174
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:19,510
captured.

175
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,190
That's the law when in the
exact opposite direction,

176
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,220
a sadist with an overwhelming
hatred of whites.

177
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,030
This alone which inflict old
plantation punishments on his captives,

178
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,200
gouging out eyes,

179
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:34,400
and mutilating any French
that he encountered before
displaying their body parts

180
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,450
on Pike's.

181
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,380
Yes,

182
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,910
it'd be wrong to call Dessa law,

183
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,320
merely a psychopath.

184
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,940
Everything he did to his white captives
had seen done by whites to slaves

185
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,530
countless times before.

186
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,810
White blonde had buried slaves alive,

187
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,770
bore them to death,

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,180
made them eat their own excrement.

189
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,690
It said that the sleep of
reason produces monsters.

190
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,080
Well,

191
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,671
that's a long,

192
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:59,520
was the perfect monster for a system that
has long ago lost all sense of reason

193
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,481
with decimals.

194
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:05,400
How do song was able to capture a huge
swath of the countries north as 17.

195
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,670
Ninety three began their
partnership at turned to songs,

196
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,610
fighters since perhaps the most
effective slave army in Santa Monica.

197
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,510
It was at this time that he changed
his name to look over it too,

198
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,170
which can be read as opening the way
a possible reference to his military

199
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,004
victories,

200
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,550
but the war on Santa more had
reached a kind of stalemate.

201
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,830
Whites were holed up in their cities.

202
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,670
The colors were attempting to establish
a separate state in the south.

203
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,420
The other slave army commanders were
just as powerful as to song what the

204
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:36,780
commands are needed was an outside force
that would come and give the entire war

205
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,340
a gigantic shove.

206
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,100
Luckily that was bound to happen.

207
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,580
Seventy,

208
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,520
93 is the year both Spain and Britain
decided to invade sound them all.

209
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,800
It was the chaos in metropolitan
mainland France that allowed the two

210
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,860
superpowers to act with impunity.

211
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,650
Seventeen 93 was the year of the
reign of terror in the anarchy.

212
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:02,030
The revolution has unleashed.

213
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,230
No one had any time to care about
what was happening in the colonies.

214
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,150
Sound them all has long been prized by
other Caribbean powers in both London and

215
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:11,910
Madrid.

216
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,040
I wanted to take it,

217
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,680
but while the British
just straight up invaded,

218
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,870
the Spaniards arrived with a plan.

219
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,050
They're calling this in.

220
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,180
Santa Domingo opens communication channels
with the slave army leaders promising

221
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,470
to respect their freedom.

222
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,660
If they fought for the Spanish crown,

223
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,020
it was a political master stroke.

224
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,150
Most of the slave leaders
signed up to fight for Madrid's,

225
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,710
including the if a tour.

226
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,390
They were tired of France and so nothing
new under a British regime accepts the

227
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,440
change of language.

228
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:39,891
However,

229
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,960
there were good reasons
for thinking Luva too.

230
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,390
It wasn't exactly down with this pledge
of allegiance to Spain that sorta bounce

231
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,500
of c come some of the remaining
French troops in Santa Mall.

232
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,160
We're in a desperate position,

233
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,180
but that fortunes,

234
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,500
they were about to change.

235
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,640
The chaos in Paris had briefly calmed
down enough for the new revolutionary

236
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:02,480
government to send out a delegation
led by the portly abolitionist,

237
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,950
leggings for the seat sown,

238
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:08,951
Phonak's arriving in hazy sulfonex quickly
divine's that there was only one way

239
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,480
to save the colony from
implosion and conquest,

240
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:15,730
and it just so happened to align perfectly
with his own beliefs on always the 29

241
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,030
slash 17 slash 93.

242
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,140
He did the unthinkable.

243
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,470
He unilaterally freed all the slaves.

244
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,450
At first I didn't believe him,

245
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,410
but 17,

246
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:25,760
94 lumberton interview.

247
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,930
It became clear that not only did softball
next mean to keep the slaves free,

248
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,180
the governments in Paris
actually backed him.

249
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
It was at this point the Louver tour and
made the decision that would catapult

250
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,270
him to greatness over to us.

251
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,730
Army had taken control of the mountains,

252
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,230
giving them a natural,

253
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:43,610
easily defended base,

254
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,360
so over to your new that he
was in a position of strength
when he announced that

255
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,190
he was defecting from the Spanish.

256
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,000
From now on,

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
he would be fighting for the French.

258
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,040
The decision changed course of the war.

259
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,270
Labor deals army marched down from the
mountains and decimated the Spanish

260
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,310
forces and their black allies.

261
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,080
Generals who nominally been over to
her superiors only days before found

262
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,970
themselves forced into retreat
into Santa Domingo as an overseer.

263
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,090
Cabs driving forwards.

264
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,820
The Spanish eventually capitulated
having just lost her separate water.

265
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:14,651
France in Europe.

266
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,790
They agreed to give up Santa Domingo
that vanquished black allies while they

267
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,990
were sent into exile,

268
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,100
but Louver tour.

269
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,240
He wasn't done yet,

270
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,590
but fitting his army around.

271
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,090
He now launched his full force against
the coastal cities occupied by the

272
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:28,720
British.

273
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,020
Although the British would cling onto
their sound Amar enclaves for a few more

274
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:32,854
years,

275
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,693
the game,

276
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,660
it was up under new verticals,

277
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,310
onslaught.

278
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,310
They were beaten down until the general
was able to make peace on his own terms,

279
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,480
the deal that Britain could restart
trading with sound Amar on solar condition

280
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,150
that louverture refrained from fermenting,

281
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,620
slave rebellion in Jamaica,

282
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,220
sends it over to your new British trade
would be Kasia rebuilding the wall,

283
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,120
shattered economy.

284
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,500
This was a win win.

285
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,670
You've got everything you wanted,

286
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,470
and the British got to back
out with a shred of dignity,

287
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:05,350
still intact as the British slowly
packed up and left over to her,

288
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,480
turned his attention to the difficult
problem of peace for the remaining whites

289
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,301
and colors.

290
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,480
This would have been a
time of paralyzing fear.

291
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,200
The slave armies were notorious for
their massacres and life under a former

292
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,210
slave must have been terrifying.

293
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,044
Prospect.

294
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,550
They have not counted on the overdose
greatness rather than reprisals.

295
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:27,280
Lived here pursued a
policy of reconciliation.

296
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,740
He forgave war crimes committed by whites.

297
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,690
He invited the plantation owners back,

298
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,980
offering them the same plantations that
owns before and the chance to make their

299
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,640
money back.

300
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,070
He instituted a policy of colorblindness.

301
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,430
Everyone would be equal and no
white would persecute any black,

302
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,750
just as no black would take vengeance
upon any white for the slaves.

303
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,340
He maintained their freedom.

304
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,510
They would have to return to the old
plantations and work for two years,

305
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,930
but they would receive wages and corporal
punishments would be banned after the

306
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:57,770
two years were up.

307
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,780
That'd be free to go wherever they
pleased it's moments such as these,

308
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:02,441
the show.

309
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,710
Why do you sold over to your
remains a fascinating figure.

310
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,240
There was a man who just spent five years
fighting a brutal race war and now he

311
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:14,170
was extending the hand of friendship to
the very people who tried to kill him

312
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,430
and all of interest to general.

313
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,060
The video was capable of being
a statesman who's pragmatism,

314
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,650
good Bible Washington's,

315
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,150
but there was still a dark side to leave
it to you and it went by the name of

316
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:25,720
Joel.

317
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,330
Jack.

318
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,840
This along in the
carnage of the civil war.

319
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:29,471
The colored said,

320
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:34,471
succeeded in carving out a small state
in the south under the command of Andre

321
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,220
Rigor in 1799,

322
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,520
low poverty or send us along
down to terminate the outpost,

323
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,190
which decimal did with extreme prejudice.

324
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
The war of knives was brutal.

325
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,490
It doesn't all slaughtered anyone who
could even conceivably be a supporter of

326
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,590
rigo leaving a trail of death in his wake.

327
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,930
While Lovato was busy consolidating
power in the north by exiling something

328
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,800
accent of the French authorities.

329
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,840
That's the little town in the
south into central wasteland.

330
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,810
That reconciliation with the
colored became impossible.

331
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,521
Bloody is.

332
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:08,030
It was the war of knives did succeed
and reunifying Santa Mall for the first

333
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,110
time since 17,

334
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,771
91.

335
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:14,771
The entire country was under the control
of one man and that man was over to

336
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,260
her.

337
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,780
As the clock ticked over
in the 19th century,

338
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:20,690
began louvered here was
slowly rebuilding the economy,

339
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:25,520
reestablishing race relations between
blacks and whites and making plans to

340
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,560
eliminate slavery in Santa Domingo.

341
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,400
In short,

342
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,190
this extraordinary man was
at the peak of his career.

343
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,540
It would take the arrival on the world
stage of a man even more extraordinary

344
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,190
than lower tier to stop him.

345
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,610
Unfortunately for the
population of Santa Monica,

346
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,920
that man was already waiting in the wings,

347
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,860
just as the Black Napoleon
was consolidating,

348
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,020
has control over Sandamala in Europe,

349
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:57,350
the Real Napoleon was doing
the same thing with France.

350
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,490
Seventeen 99,

351
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:58,760
so on.

352
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,350
Napoleon Bonaparte go from being a
general in the revolutionary army to first

353
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:05,930
console of France as it
is with many great men.

354
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,600
One stage simply wasn't big
enough for both of them.

355
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,231
One of them,

356
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:14,060
Napoleon's first acts was to declare
the French colonies would be governed by

357
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,960
special rules,

358
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:19,200
meaning the declaration of the rights of
men would not apply since over to your

359
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,431
own,

360
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,220
has not actually declared
independence from France.

361
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:25,430
Instead of insisting that he
was ruling on behalf of Paris,

362
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,990
this was something of a problem.

363
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,760
Everyone knew that a slave economy
could not be ruled by a former slave.

364
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,300
Not that things went immediately south
though Louver to you publicly praised

365
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,811
Napoleon,

366
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,330
recognizing him as the
new leader of France,

367
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,830
and he swore his loyalty to him.

368
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,930
His actions seem to mollify Napoleon,

369
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,860
the first consult confirms that over too,

370
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,490
as the legitimate leader of
the colony of Santa Monica,

371
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,070
but he also issued him with a warning.

372
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,000
Lova too,

373
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,930
was not under any circumstances
to invade Santa Domingo.

374
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,220
So now can you guess what you're did next?

375
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,001
At the time,

376
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,260
Santa Domingo was a vassal state,

377
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,780
technically ruled by frogs,

378
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,690
but still in the hands of
Spanish administrators.

379
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,180
It also continued to practice slavery,

380
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:11,240
something lovatare couldn't
tolerate his on his doorstep.

381
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:11,841
In Eighteen,

382
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,100
oh one he marched in,

383
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,510
sees the country and declared
slavery abolished back in France.

384
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,130
The mouth hits the ventilator incense
to bind it over to his actions.

385
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,110
The government demanded something be done.

386
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,310
Napoleon himself,

387
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,144
he communicated.

388
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,050
He had a vague plans.

389
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:29,870
Who invade America has
recognized that sound.

390
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:32,930
Amal slave armies could help
make that dream a reality,

391
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,700
but his wounded ego eventually got
the better of him at the end of 18.

392
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:36,801
Oh,

393
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:37,011
one.

394
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,610
The first console dispatched a military
expedition under the control of Charles.

395
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,770
Look to retake sound mall.

396
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,880
Not long after he passed the Lore of May
the 20th bringing slavery back to the

397
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,714
colonies.

398
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,560
It was the beginning of the ends of both
do sauna over tour and French control

399
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,360
of Santa Maher on paper over to you
should have been able to rally popular

400
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,490
support in the face of a French invasion.

401
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,320
Sadly,

402
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
in reality is new equal
society was not very popular.

403
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,580
The economy was still a shambles and the
returned whites resented the empowered

404
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,330
blacks.

405
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,850
The colored still remember
decimals atrocities.

406
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,923
The blacks,

407
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,440
well,

408
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,210
they may have technically been free,

409
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,650
but they were still stuck
on that plantations of the
three major demographics

410
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:20,484
and we'll send them all,

411
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,390
not one felt comfortable
with the inverters.

412
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,250
Phoenix state as look like made landfall.

413
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,641
First,

414
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:30,810
the whites flocked to his side and the
colored and then many of the slaves.

415
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,440
Finally,

416
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,840
even George drank the salon turns on his
old friends and through his lot in with

417
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,440
the French and this one,

418
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,760
it was the end for lower tier.

419
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,720
After a few months of token resistance
over to your contact at the clerk and

420
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,530
promise today down his arms in exchange
for a guarantee that the French would

421
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,430
not reimpose.

422
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,790
Slavery began like agreed on two songs,

423
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,600
suspended military operations,

424
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,000
retiring to his old farm.

425
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,760
He was surprised with an invitation to
meet a French general at an out of the

426
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,660
way plantation.

427
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
It was clearly a trap,

428
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,390
but over to here was maybe just too tired
by his sudden fall from power by that

429
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:03,990
point,

430
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,260
whatever the reason he accepted
as he arrived at the meeting spot,

431
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,470
he was arrested under the
orders of Napoleon himself
and deported France to solo

432
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,730
over to your manual,

433
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,270
had freed the slaves are ruled sound
all for one brief shining moments would

434
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:19,860
never see us home again.

435
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,590
Send to the Jura mountains
in southern France.

436
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:22,980
Liberty.

437
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,900
I spent the next year being beaten,

438
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,003
neglected,

439
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,083
and left to rot.

440
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,610
He wrote a bits like the dreamed a lot,

441
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,950
but in the cold mountain,

442
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:33,680
air is health collapsed by this point,

443
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
a man in his sixties,

444
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,480
lover to as body soon failed him.

445
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,650
He succumbs to repeated infections
before finally slipping away.

446
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,970
On April the seventh,

447
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,371
18,

448
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:42,490
oh,

449
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,580
three black is white counterpart woods.

450
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,570
In 20 years,

451
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,580
the Black Napoleon died alone,

452
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,720
unloved,

453
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,870
and an exile is achievements
seemingly forgotten.

454
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,810
Before he went over to her,

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
did have time to write his thoughts
down on Santa Monica Future.

456
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,890
He felt the genie was out of the bottle
and soon another black like in would

457
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,790
come along to permanently free
the slaves and expel the French.

458
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,380
He was more right than he knew.

459
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,550
As he lay dying.

460
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,120
That's along.

461
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,500
I had switched sides again.

462
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,340
The cleric responded by trying to commit
genocide against the slave population.

463
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,360
Even using ship holds filled with
fumes as primitive gas chambers.

464
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,710
This was a bad decision.

465
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,730
The dark force driving decile law
was more than equal to the clerks.

466
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,100
Demons stands in a genocidal war.

467
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,380
They could only be one winner in 18.

468
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:28,501
Oh,

469
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:31,050
three decimal systematically exterminated.

470
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,390
All of the whites in more men,

471
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,840
women,

472
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,231
children,

473
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:34,621
soldiers,

474
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:35,370
civilians,

475
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,050
each were butchered by a caravan
of death that offered no mercy.

476
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,011
Only polls,

477
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,880
Brits and Americans were spared the former
because many of them had arrived with

478
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,400
the clerical.

479
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,150
You need to switch sides the latter to
you purely because that's a long knew

480
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:52,270
that he needed British and American
trade to rebuild the economy.

481
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,050
The Clark himself didn't live
to see this final French defeat.

482
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,330
He died of yellow fever in November of 18.

483
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:58,421
Oh,

484
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:58,721
two.

485
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:02,850
Just after launching his campaign
of genocide on January the first 18,

486
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:02,960
oh,

487
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
four dozen law renames the nation Pacey
and declared independence from France.

488
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,740
The slaves had done the impossible that
fought for their freedom and then one,

489
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,400
although Haiti would endure
centuries of economic misery,

490
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,540
natural disasters,

491
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,720
and occupation by powers
including the United States,

492
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,870
it would never again be ruled by France.

493
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,770
All of this happens because
of one man to Solon.

494
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,201
Level two,

495
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,940
you may not have lived to see it,

496
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,650
but his nation could never have one.

497
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:31,090
It's freedom without him.

498
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,080
It's thanks to the Black Napoleon that
Santa more didn't really become another

499
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,000
British or Spanish outpost,

500
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,500
and it's thanks to his insistence on
ending slavery that Haitians remained free

501
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,630
from 1794 onwards.

502
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,700
It was a great commander,

503
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,820
a shrewd statesman,

504
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,270
and a man who tirelessly
advocated for racial equality.

505
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,110
His dream of creating an equal sound,

506
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,150
Amal may have failed,

507
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,060
but it was a noble dream or
the same for that reason,

508
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,940
if no other to soul
life for cure the slave,

509
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,120
it became a leader
deserves to be remembered.

510
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,370
