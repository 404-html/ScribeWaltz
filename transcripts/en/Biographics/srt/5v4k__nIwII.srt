1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,560
Tomasa talking motto was the controlling
force of the Spanish inquisition.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,000
He presided over the systematic purging
of the so called heretic Jews that has

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,930
gone down in history as one of the worst
religious persecutions of all time.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,620
But was he the monster that history is
painted well in this week's biographics,

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,150
we uncover the real story
of Tomas to talk to Marta.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,713
Yeah,

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,420
it's a monster talking motto was born
in 1420 in or around the village of OLED

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,210
and the Kingdom of old
Castiel in modern day Spain.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,610
The talk martyrs were of Jewish heritage.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,031
However,

11
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:47,860
Tomasa's forbears had converted to
Catholicism to become what we're known as

12
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:50,140
converses or converted ones.

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,630
His was a distinguished
family with an uncle John,

14
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,740
who had joined the Dominican order into
us making advancements in the royal

15
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:01,741
palace in Rome in 1431 John to talk motto
was made master if the palace and then

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,180
in 1439 a cardinal with an uncle in such
a high position in the Catholic Church.

17
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,220
The Path was set for young to master,

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,220
make his own mark within
the church from a young age,

19
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:13,420
he sees the opportunity.

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,740
He was a diligent students who develops
a reputation as a pious and humble young

21
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:18,340
man.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,360
Prior to the age of 10 he was admitted
to the San Pablo Dominican monastery.

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,650
For the next two decades.

24
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,260
His life revolved around
ecclesiastical study,

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,040
prayer,

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,873
confession,

27
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,930
and church custom.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,140
At around the age of 35 he became prior
of the Dominican convent at Segovia.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,700
For the next 20 years talking,

30
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,130
Marta presided over his small
parish living the life of a humble,

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,360
quiet man of God.

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,500
He developed a reputation as an energetic
and fearless preacher of the word and

33
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,120
a strict disciplinarian,

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,690
the facts that he was strictest on himself
because the people in his community

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,800
to look at his as a fine example
of piety and to holiness,

36
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,970
he refused to eat meat.

37
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:59,260
He slaps on a bad boards in which not
wear anything other than his old habits.

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,860
He was also a voracious reader and
had a fascination with architecture,

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,360
especially that of the church

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,580
up until the 15th century.

41
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:16,930
The rulers of Casteel and Aragon
governed a series of separate districts

42
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,210
kingdoms within the Iberian peninsula.

43
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,420
It was the marriage of Isabella of Castiel
to Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469 which

44
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:29,650
began the gradual process of unification
that would lead to the creation of

45
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,610
modern day Spain.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,630
It was around 1470 you and talking
Marta became acquainted with Princess

47
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:38,740
Isabella who was then in our young
twenties the princess was spending quite a

48
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,700
lot of time in Segovia and s with doc
and Marta having established quite a

49
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,960
reputation as a holy man.

50
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,530
Of Note,

51
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,210
he was retained as how confessor at first
he declined to accepts the offer that

52
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,760
was won over by the princesses insistence.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,890
On December the 13th 1474 Isabella
was crowned queen of Castiel and Leon.

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,690
Her relationship with talking motto had
and she came to rely on him for advice.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,250
Isabella and talking about it,

56
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,020
they were both obsessed with rooting out
religious heresy and the purity of the

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,710
church.

58
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,340
Both the queen and husband's King Fudge
and atoms had a high opinion of the

59
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,370
humble priest and he was quickly
promoted within the order.

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,690
If he had been ambitious,

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,340
he may have ascended to a cause,

62
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,750
an oil ship like his uncle,

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,100
even to the office of Pope.

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,090
But talking about,

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,570
uh,

66
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,460
he had no such lofty intentions.

67
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,790
He was content's to live
the life of a simple monk.

68
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,530
In May of 1475,

69
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:33,400
the Portuguese invaded Spain and it
attempts to seize the crown away from

70
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,990
Isabella and Ferdinand's.

71
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,640
A bloody war was waged familia year
culminating in the Spanish victory at the

72
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,510
battle of Toro on March the first 1476
in the wake of this great victory is

73
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:48,310
about a road around the countryside
holding court in every town that she came

74
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,840
across as she would hear
complaints about murderers,

75
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,251
thieves,

76
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:55,750
and other wrongdoers using her authority
as Monique to fast track judicial

77
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,440
process.

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,430
She would order the guilty to either
be short or beheaded immediately.

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,910
This she did with a cold
and clinical and precision,

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,810
not this time token Mata was busy with
organizing the construction of a new

81
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:08,920
Dominican monastery.

82
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,963
At a villa.

83
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,270
Jews had been living in Spain for some
1,500 years with about 80,000 of them.

84
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,650
At the time Isabella was queen.

85
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,560
This was compared to some
6 million Christians.

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,110
Unlike France and England's,

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,010
the Spanish had not expelled the Jews,

88
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:31,800
but they had forced many of
them to convert to Christianity.

89
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,560
These were the ones who
were known as convert Zos.

90
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,580
Many within the realm,

91
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:35,911
however,

92
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:40,020
did not put any stock in the Christian
sincerity of the conveyor Zos.

93
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,040
They were believed to be false converts
who practice their own Jewish religion

94
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,600
while professing Christianity.

95
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,550
This was seen by many in positions of
power of direct threat to the security of

96
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:54,240
the realm in general and to the church
in particular in the eyes of the queen.

97
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,190
This faith amounted to Paris.

98
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,160
He and it was something that
she simply would not tolerate.

99
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,790
In fact,

100
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,670
she would not put up with any
form of religious hypocrisy.

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,760
It was during a visit to Seville and
1477 that she first became interested in

102
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:12,270
adopting an inquisition or investigation
into the religious state of the

103
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:12,870
kingdom.

104
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,591
The following year,

105
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:17,700
a papal bull was issued by pope six
does the fourth granting permission to

106
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,890
establish an inquisition within Castiel.

107
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,760
The petitions of the pipe requesting the
inquisition had been written by talking

108
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,770
Mada and Cardinal Mendoza,

109
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,730
but Isabella,

110
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,900
she moved cautiously.

111
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,470
She was of the opinion that poor
training was the main reason that Jewish

112
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,930
converts when not fully
adhering to the faith.

113
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:37,110
And so she put the emphasis
on religious education.

114
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,280
The queen appointed two of them.

115
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:42,360
Most trusted church advises Cardinal
Mendoza and the future archbishop of

116
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,320
Granada and Nando de Talavera to the
task of reeducating the way it would

117
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:46,721
converse.

118
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,720
So a program was put in place in Seville
by which local priests would retrain

119
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,090
the misguided converses.

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,100
But after two years with very
little headway being made,

121
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,660
Isabella had concede that
stronger measures when needed,

122
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,020
she remains reluctance
to enact the inquisition.

123
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,240
But pressure came upon
her from her advisors,

124
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,010
including talking Marta to do so.

125
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,210
Even her husband,

126
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,090
King Ferdinand was in
favor of the pragmatist.

127
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,500
He foresaw the confiscation of conversa
property has a much needed revenue

128
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,940
gathering source for the state.

129
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,811
Finally,

130
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,240
and against her better judgment.

131
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:29,960
Isabella are issued a royal decree on
September the 27 1480 establishing the

132
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:32,600
tribunal of the Holy
Office of the inquisition.

133
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,410
The Papal Bull authorizing the acquisition
had given us a better and Fudge

134
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:36,470
Nan's,

135
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,220
the freedom to select the members who
made up the inquisition tribunals.

136
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,330
They chose Tamasic talking and along
with college nor Mendoza and two other

137
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:45,040
Dominicans,

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,381
Frey,

139
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,840
Miguel Morello and Frey Juan
to some Martine Mendoza.

140
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,890
It took the position of
chief judge while talking.

141
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:55,190
Mata took the position of consulting
x spat the other two members where the

142
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:59,000
active inquisitor's who sought out
and it's brought heretics before the

143
00:06:59,001 --> 00:06:59,834
tribunal.

144
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,870
The first area of focus
for the inquisition was the
almost entirely Jewish city

145
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,013
of Seville.

146
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,160
The arrival living twisters dressed in
distinctive white robes and black hoods

147
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,470
caused panic among the conversa community.

148
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,990
With around 4,000 people fleeing Savelle,

149
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,070
still the inquisitors set about
their work with ruthless efficiency.

150
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,900
The first public execution took place
on February the sixth 1481 on that day,

151
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,370
six people were burned to death setting
the stage for the horror that was to

152
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,790
unfold over the coming months
and years from Seville.

153
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,960
The inquisition spread throughout the
kingdom with tribunals set up in Cordoba,

154
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,290
Yay.

155
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,240
And to the religious Capitol of Toledo.

156
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,830
A passing was soon established,

157
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,180
would begin with the people of a town
being prepared by having the fear of God

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
preached to them from the pulpit.

159
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,120
Then the inquisitors would arrive in
the town and the edict of grace would be

160
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,630
red.

161
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,990
This was a cool to come forth
and confess your lack of faith.

162
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,660
Those who did so and
renounced their Judaism.

163
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,890
Good Hope for mercy.

164
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,160
Those who didn't would face the
full wrath of the inquisitor's.

165
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,610
Those who were taken into detention would
have all of their property taken away

166
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:05,210
from them.

167
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,390
This would obviously leave their
family and a hopeless situation.

168
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,840
The primary goal of the interrogators
was to obtain a confession.

169
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:16,841
It didn't matter if it came voluntary
or if torture had to be used to extract

170
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:17,360
it.

171
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,230
Methods of torture progressed from foot
roasting in which the suspect's fees,

172
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:25,940
well loved and fashion than held over
a burning fire to the Judas cradle.

173
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,740
A device composed of a tall,

174
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:32,390
thin stool with a triangular shaped seat
in which the victim was sodium pails.

175
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,530
And then there was the rack,

176
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:37,070
in which case the victim was tied to a
wooden frame and their body was stretched

177
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:39,560
as the ball's moved in
opposite directions.

178
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,820
Such torture would convince even the
most innocent of people to confess.

179
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,120
Still subject coerced confession
was not legally binding.

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,410
It had to be afterwards confirmed by
the suspect for it to hold any weight.

181
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,410
The trial that was held would be the
defendants only opportunity to defend

182
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,060
himself if he was able to,

183
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,870
he would call upon witnesses to prove
his innocence or to cast doubt upon the

184
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,430
voracity of the accuser.

185
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,391
If found guilty,

186
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:07,920
the person could be reconciled or pennants
if they demonstrated can triteness,

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,010
they would lose all their property and
have to undergo such punishments is

188
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,890
whipping or a term of imprisonment.

189
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,370
Those who refuse to denounce Judaism
would be condemned to the flames.

190
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,910
The inquisition created an atmosphere
of fear throughout the kingdom.

191
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,200
One of its most chilling aspects was
that it thrived on a diet of anonymous

192
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,034
accusation.

193
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,530
Then when the suspect who
was forced to confess,

194
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:32,190
he was required to produce names of
others who had been co-conspirators with

195
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:32,550
him.

196
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,550
By 1483 the inquisition had
become a monster that was
completely out of control.

197
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,220
Isabella's initial goal was simply to
weed out the false converts among the

198
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,330
conversion of Jews,

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,200
but the climate of accusation and
torture had led to something far,

200
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,110
far more sinister with
no centralized control.

201
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:53,130
The various tribunals around the kings
and were operating according to their own

202
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:53,964
dictates.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,690
News was constantly being received by the
pope in Rome of accesses that when's B

204
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,230
owns the powers that he
had given it as papal bull.

205
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,610
This call was tension between the Pope
and queen is about in order to settle the

206
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:06,241
situation,

207
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,700
Isabella tend to hire advisors
at Thomas did Torquemada.

208
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,840
It was decided that all the powers of
the inquisition would be decentralized

209
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,420
with token WMATA himself at the hat.

210
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,310
He had the skills and experience it was
believed to please both of a Monique and

211
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,570
the pope at the same time.

212
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,650
The pope of greed stands in October
of 1483 he names talking Marta.

213
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,760
The inquisitor general
of Castiel and the owner.

214
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:35,971
In contrast,

215
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:37,960
the history's painting him as an ego,

216
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,130
persecutor of Jews.

217
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:41,230
He was chomping at the
bits to torture them.

218
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,950
The truth is that talk Amada would
rather not have taken up the position.

219
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,760
He would have preferred to continue
to live the simple life of a monk.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,360
Yes,

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,740
having accepted the position,

222
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,610
he did take it on with full force knots
with the goal of persecuting the Jews

223
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:54,791
there,

224
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:59,110
but ensuring that all Catholics
were true as loyal Catholics.

225
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,250
He's all the inquisition,

226
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:02,400
not as an instrument of crew Tara,

227
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:07,270
but as a vehicle for necessary reform
talk a Marta began his oversight of the

228
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:11,650
inquisition by doing a way with the
worst excesses of his predecessors,

229
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,290
putting in place a system
of judicial process.

230
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,890
He then improve the conditions for
people who were imprisoned under the

231
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:18,640
inquisition.

232
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,121
Talk about,

233
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:19,390
uh,

234
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,280
next set about refining veep.

235
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,170
Stages of the inquisition process.

236
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,490
The edict of grace would be read up to
three times into period of 40 days given

237
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,470
for repentant ones to come forward.

238
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,220
A person could only be convicted
on the testimony of two witnesses.

239
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,210
And now the complaints had to be in
writing and they had to be signed.

240
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,430
Once a person was
denounced by two witnesses,

241
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:42,100
he would be investigated
usually without his knowledge.

242
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,480
If evidence of false religious
worship was clear and specific,

243
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,150
the person would be put
before the court talk.

244
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:53,020
Amada required that a person's trial
must be held within three days of his.

245
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,340
The charges against him would be state.

246
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:55,661
It didn't.

247
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:59,860
He would be urged to confess to his gills
if he refused up to two more hearings

248
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:04,450
would be held only after the third hearing
with the interrogation begin talk on

249
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,470
Mars and produced a handbook to help
his inquisitors do identify heretical

250
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,090
converses giveaway signs of their heresy
where such things as cooking all their

251
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,870
meals for the weekend on a Friday night
if they got their supplies from Jewish

252
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,370
rather than Kristy and suppliers,

253
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,500
and if they were known not to eat pork
just by the fact that his name has been

254
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:27,220
forever linked with the worst excesses
of the inquisitions torture processes.

255
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,900
The reality is that talk
Amada was responsible for
mitigating the worst excesses

256
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,830
of the process.

257
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,250
He stipulated that it was not to
be used as a means of punishment,

258
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:40,240
but strictly for obtaining information
related to the charge at hands.

259
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,930
Furthermore,

260
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,470
torture could only be administered with
the recent approval of the bishop of the

261
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,410
diocese and the visa of the Supreme Court.

262
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,311
In addition,

263
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,340
the doctor had to be present
throughout the torture process.

264
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,211
Talk about that.

265
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,110
Did away with some of the more barbarous
methods of torture and replaced them

266
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:58,390
with what was known as the water care.

267
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,200
The interrogated person would be
stripped naked and tied with cords.

268
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,190
Upon a wooden ladder.

269
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,850
The nostrils stopped and his
drawers were held apart by tongues.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,640
Then a piece of linen was
placed over his mouth.

271
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,180
Water was then slowly pour it onto
the cloth to travel down the throat.

272
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,540
The sensation that resulted
was that one was suffocating.

273
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,790
However it Randy resulted in long term.

274
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,660
Harmon's usually resulted in a
confession being obtained talk,

275
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:24,280
Amada organized a Sonata,

276
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:28,780
the inquisitor's Seville during which
she impressed upon the tribunal members

277
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:29,650
his new rules.

278
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,340
He then convenes tribunals in old
Jewish strongholds including Seville,

279
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:33,941
Cordoba,

280
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:34,411
Gian,

281
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:35,620
and [inaudible]

282
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,890
with the inquisition now and out
and could still talk to Marta.

283
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,210
Now set about implementing is in Aragon.

284
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,340
This was a challenging assignment.

285
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,100
The gene is Helen.

286
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,050
Plenty of positions of power and these
men were naturally resistance to the

287
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:54,861
inquisition review.

288
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:55,310
Again,

289
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,580
the governor of Arizona and along with
most of the judges and lawyers in the

290
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,200
stage where all converges those,

291
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,650
they all banded together and opposition
to the work of talking motto.

292
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,720
Still the chief inquisitive forged ahead.

293
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,050
They appointed two of his best
men as inquisitors for Aragon.

294
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,040
Leaving is meant to it.

295
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,430
He then returned to focus on carrying
out the inquisition and Castiel.

296
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,270
Meanwhile,

297
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,680
Jewish leaders in both states,

298
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:18,080
we're organizing an
opposition to the inquisition.

299
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,540
A great campaign for
democracy was launched,

300
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,390
two monks web centre Cordoba
to besiege the Queens,

301
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:24,620
but an end to the inquisition.

302
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,020
The men often large sums
of money to the crown.

303
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,740
However,

304
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,960
Isabella rejected all of their efforts.

305
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,780
Now desperate,

306
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,670
the Jewish leaders began to speak
of assassinating the inquisitor's.

307
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,810
A group of prominent Jews met together
and agreed to hire a gang of cutthroats

308
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,430
to carry out the assassinations.

309
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,360
They began by disposing of high
ranking priests within the inquisition.

310
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,530
Father PTO abuse was kneeling in prayer
before the blessed sacrament when a

311
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:50,750
gangster crept in and
stabbed him in the back,

312
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,860
the and queen with outrage that this
attack and twins all out to hunt down the

313
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,360
people who are responsible,

314
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,850
the gang who had been employed
to carry out the Giddings,

315
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,710
they were rounded up and execute it.

316
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,371
Meanwhile,

317
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:05,180
the death of the priest
who had immediately been
raised to st Jude lead to a

318
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,760
backlash against the conversion.

319
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,820
Any oppositions of the inquisition in
Aragon now came to an end allowing talking

320
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:14,840
about a free reign to bring the Jews
there too is true faith in the course of

321
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:18,290
his inquiries into the Jewish activity
is talking about are uncovered a plot by

322
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:18,710
converse,

323
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,710
a leaders in Toledo to seize control of
the city during the 1485 Corpus Christi

324
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,480
Prosecution and murder or
the leading Christians.

325
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,320
As a result,

326
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,080
a large number of Jewish
leaders are put to death

327
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,590
off to 12 years.

328
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:41,310
The inquisition had still not managed to
stomp out of the Jewish heresy problem.

329
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,540
Talking motto was of the belief that the
reason that the conversa is we're not

330
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:50,250
fully engaged with Catholicism was because
they still associated with the Jewish

331
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:51,040
community.

332
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,650
I only by putting an end to this
association with the problem be solved.

333
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,461
Consequently,

334
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:59,880
he began putting pressure on the king
and Queen's you issue an edict expanding

335
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,230
all Jews from Spain.

336
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,410
Then in 1495 Jews and six conveys A's
were accused of crucifying and measuring a

337
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,080
Christian child in the village
of the Goddamn the accusation.

338
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,160
It was probably false,

339
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,310
but it led to an unprecedented
antisemetic backlash.

340
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,061
Finally,

341
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:19,020
in March of 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand
and sign their names to a documents

342
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,440
which ordered that all Jews who
had not converted to Christianity,

343
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,760
where to leave the kingdom.

344
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,880
By August the second 1492 around 160,000
people manage to get out before the

345
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:30,720
deadline.

346
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,080
Most of them sold their possessions for
a pittance and were forced to travel as

347
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:34,920
far as Africa,

348
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,850
the Balkans,

349
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,730
and Rome before finally
finding a place to settle.

350
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,390
Many of them are unable to find a place
where they would be accepted straggled

351
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,940
back to Spain to be baptized as Catholics.

352
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,550
Others reportedly paid exorbitant
prices for passage on ships,

353
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:51,180
Sony to be killed at sea
and thrown overboard.

354
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,000
The number of Jews who
remained in Spain is convert.

355
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:58,110
Those was far greater than those who had
left and despite the worst efforts if

356
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,860
the inquisition,

357
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,170
they remains Jewish believers at hot.

358
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,801
However,

359
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:05,400
these conversions now had no Jewish
cultural support to back them up.

360
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,090
They were completely on their own
synagogues throughout the lands where I've

361
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:12,780
taken over and claimed for the Catholic
Church by now talking about it,

362
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,010
it was at the height of his power.

363
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,660
He had unfettered control
if the inquisition and was
a key player in the royal

364
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:19,440
household.

365
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,310
The combination of the inquisition,

366
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:21,631
nams,

367
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:22,620
the Jewish expulsion,

368
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:26,040
had insured the Catholicism
would remain untainted

369
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,620
in 1494 talk Martin now age 74 again
to suffer the effects of old age,

370
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,820
his body lacks to the energy he wants
ads into struggle to compete as duties as

371
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:42,690
grand inquisitor.

372
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,130
Pope Gregory the fourth appointed for
assistant inquisitors to lighten the load.

373
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,060
In that same year,

374
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,410
Isabella and Ferdinand gift attended the
Jewish cemetery at a villa for him to

375
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,790
use as his own monastery.

376
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,910
It was here that he died peacefully on
September the 16th 1498 the acquisition

377
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,460
was to survive talking motto by 300
Years Spreading throughout the Spanish el

378
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,161
territory,

379
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,120

the Spanish Netherlands,

381
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,840
and the territory held by
Spain and the Americas.

382
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,580
The inquisition remains one of the worst
examples of man's inhumanity towards

383
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,320
man and the man who led it.

384
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,700
