1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,110
Long before Kim Jong own became the
goto tyrants for five star absurdity.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,000
There was another dictator on the block.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,620
Muammar Gaddafi,

4
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:09,950
rude,

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,130
Libya for 42 years with an iron fist,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,030
wraps in a sequin the glove,

7
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,861
so garish,

8
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:19,340
it would put liberace to
shame his flamboyant rain.

9
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:24,080
It was famous for its absurdity for
every headline relating to his terrorist

10
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:24,711
activities.

11
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:29,590
There were maybe a dozen more about his
plastic surgery addiction or his old

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,040
female bodyguard treat.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,740
By the time Gaddafi
was overthrown in 2011,

14
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,340
he was less fit than he was simply mocked,

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,920
but behind the monstrous vanity lay,

16
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:43,850
a man who was simply a month
staff rape and Gaddafi's Libya.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,590
It was institutionalized.

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,860
Mass executions were broadcast on TV.

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,300
Dissidence were executed,

20
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,950
and their bodies were kept in freezers.

21
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,620
For these self-styled King
of all kings to visit.

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,783
It is leisure,

23
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,260
but such depraved behavior.

24
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:58,760
It wasn't created in a vacuum.

25
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,520
It was only thanks to
Libya's tortured history.

26
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,140
There's good offi was able to
imprint his psychosis on his nation.

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,400
Today on biographics,

28
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,700
we're exploring the life of
the mad dog of the Middle East.

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,580
Most historians of Gaddafi
start with the obvious place,

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,250
the sweltering and June day in
1942 when he was born in a nomads,

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,960
tends near the dusty
fishing village of Santa Fe.

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,190
But to really understand Gaddafi,

33
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:38,100
you have to go back further all the way.
