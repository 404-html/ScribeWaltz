00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,780
his writings inspired
the great revolutionary
movements of the 20th century

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,040
leading to the dictatorial rise of men
like Joseph Stalin and Mouser Dong.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,620
He lived a life of poverty and obscurity.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,880
Contends let others take the limelight
and aware that his ideas would not be

9
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:36,690
realized during his lifetime. We
remember him as the father of communism,

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,590
yet the version that took hold in
the Soviet Union and China or little

11
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,830
resemblance to what he had envisioned.
In this week's biographics,

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,890
we discovered the man who was Karl Marx.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,913
Okay.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,270
Comox was born on May the fifth 1818
and the historic German town of Tria.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,580
His was an upper middle
class family with his father,

16
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:03,870
Heinrich are doing well as a lawyer
cause mother Henrietta was from a wealthy

17
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,610
Dutch family.
The family was Jewish,

18
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,120
but Heinrich had converted to Christianity
the year before Cole was born in

19
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,150
order to avoid the harsh laws
that were being imposed upon Jews.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
Cole was the third of nine children.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,910
He became the eldest son when his brother
Bart's died in 1919 the young call was

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,500
a lively child who was prone
to getting into trouble.

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,190
He was homeschooled by his father to the
age of 12 at which point he entered the

24
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:29,400
tree. Our high school, the headmaster
of the school, Hugo Whitson Bark,

25
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:33,540
took an instant liking to the inquisitive
young Marx and helped him to mold his

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,100
early philosophical ideas,

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,940
which mark taught liberal ideas to a
students and employed a young liberal

28
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,060
humanists as teachers.
As a result,

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,180
the school develops a reputation as
a fermenter of dangerous ideologies.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,290
In 1832 where's embark was placed under
surveillance by the authorities with the

31
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,750
school being searched
for subversive materials.

32
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,850
Call graduated from the school at the age
of 17 he furthered his studies at Bond

33
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,360
University and rolling as law students
in October of 1835 he found the workload

34
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,510
during his first semester to be extremely
challenging by the beginning of 1836

35
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,410
years. Originalist his
attendance to a part time level.

36
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,880
He spent most nights at local pubs in
often woke the next day with a hangover

37
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,670
limiting the amount of focus that
he could give to his studies.

38
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,730
On one occasion he was actually
arrested for public intoxication.

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,680
After a year of wasting his efforts at
the University of Bonn marks his father,

40
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,670
he put his foot down.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,900
He transferred his wayward son to the
University of Berlin and ordered him to

42
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,030
start getting serious about his education.

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,640
The summer before he transferred
to Berlin University,

44
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,460
cold returned home to triad.

45
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,260
He began to romance with a
young woman called Jenny Vaughn.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,340
West fallen who he had known since
childhood before leaving for university in

47
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,130
October called proposed
and the two were engaged.

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,910
The move to Berlin University has served
the purpose of encouraging marks to get

49
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:56,230
serious about his studies.

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,890
He replaced late night carousing with
membership and the of philosophical

51
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,520
societies. He became interested in
the ideas of German philosopher,

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,550
Gwf Heagle and the idea is that he Moldova
Sora expression in a number of essays

53
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,670
and treatises that he began working
on calls Brian Academic Star.

54
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,930
It was diminished in May of 1838
with the death of his father.

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,090
He had a great deal of respect and love.

56
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,670
The Heinrich ans was
shattered by his loss.

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,000
His father had been supporting him
financially and the sudden loss of this

58
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,460
support imposed a
financial hardship on him.

59
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,390
This was a great consent and the West
fallen so when now convinced that call

60
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,810
would not be able to support
their daughter as his
bright, but the young couple,

61
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,930
they continued that courtship even though
they were far away from each other.

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,190
Okay.

63
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,600
Following his father's death mocks shifted
the focus of his studies from law to

64
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:49,290
philosophy.

65
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,290
His goal was to graduate with honors
and then secure a position at the

66
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,920
university as a philosophy lecturer
in order to help fund his studies.

67
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,600
He sought work as a journalist.

68
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,930
He secured a position with the most
controversial newspaper in the region,

69
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,340
the Rhineland News,

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
the paper expressed vocal opposition to
the Prussian occupation of the Ryman.

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,630
In October of 1842 Karl Marx became
the editor in chief of the paper.

72
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,280
It was through this paper.

73
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,660
The marks began writing about communism
and what form of possible communist

74
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:16,680
government could take,

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,650
but when he openly criticized
the Russian monarchs on Nicholas,

76
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,530
the first there was a step too far.

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,330
The brushing authorities
moved in and they shut down.

78
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,520
The paper box was now an
unemployed journalists,

79
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,540
but that didn't stop him and Jenny
marrying on June the 19th 18 at 43 does

80
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,480
ceremony took place in a Protestant
church and was attended by members of both

81
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,210
families though many of the
West filing plan mustards,

82
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,180
there's Jenny was marrying
below her station. However,

83
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,690
the marriage it was to last the couple
until they were potted by death.

84
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,280
Colin, Jenny, they moved
in with Jenny's mother.

85
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,270
They lived off the mother's
step and does color.

86
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,760
Tried to restart his writing career.

87
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,650
He managed to get a writing gig writing
for a newspaper called the Deutsche

88
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,720
Franz Usha Yaba heard that had as its
audience far leftists in the Rhineland.

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,020
The paper that had been started
by German Socialist Arnold Ruiz,

90
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,860
who was based in Paris in
October of 1843 marks his wife,

91
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,680
they moved to Paris and
bordered with region. His wife.

92
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,470
In 1844 Jenny gave birth
to their first Charles.

93
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,750
There's made the living conditions
extremely crammed and so the marketers,

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,320
they moved into their own
apartments as well as publishing.

95
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:27,300
The newspaper marks and
rouge worked together on two
treatises that would become

96
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,780
very controversial. The seconds of them
was called on the Jewish question evenly.

97
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,910
Marx was of Jewish ancestry himself.

98
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:38,350
The pamphlet comes across
as quite antisemitic in as
he wrote for the first time

99
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,330
if the proletariat,

100
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:43,090
so working class bands of revolutionaries
who would throw off the yoke of

101
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,810
religion and other cultural bonds
to finally unite the masses.

102
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,590
Soon after Mark's moved on from working
with rouge defined employments with the

103
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,500
Paris based newspaper,
four watts or forward,

104
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:58,010
which targeted Germans living in France
that ava was sponsored by the League of

105
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,310
the just made up of German immigrants
who believed in a communist system where

106
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:05,090
everyone enjoyed economic equality.
It was while working for Volvo,

107
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:09,320
it's that Mark's maps since
forms an alliance with
Friedrich Engels, the two men.

108
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,340
They immediately jelled with their ideas
converging into what would be cool to

109
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:18,080
classical Marxism. Marx was inspired by
a report that angles had written goals,

110
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,300
the conditions of the
working class in England.

111
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,880
He was convinced more than
ever that the working class,

112
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,630
which eventually rise up and
overthrow their oppressors angles,

113
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:29,810
came from a wealthy family and over
the years he would prop up Mark's

114
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,610
financially time and time again.

115
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,000
They're revolutionary ideas that mocks
was espousing through his writing.

116
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:39,110
Soon came to the attention of the Prussian
authorities who put pressure on him

117
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,030
to be France.
The interior ministry,

118
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,900
it's shut down votes and mocks was
given 24 hours to leave the country.

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,520
He decided to relocate to Brussels,

120
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,550
Belgium with his wife and baby
joining him a few days later.

121
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,090
Belgium was a liberal and free thinking
country and so it was a natural fit for

122
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:03,240
the leftest philosophies of called mocks,
so you don't have to assess.

123
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:03,991
I think in Brussels,

124
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,310
Jenny became pregnant with the
couple's second child back in Germany.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,770
Marks in mother-in-law became concerned
that her daughter wouldn't be able to

126
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:14,790
cope with the stress of starting a new
with one small child and another one on

127
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,930
the way she sends them. Made Seven Helen
de Muth to Russell's to help her cope.

128
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,770
Helen would from then on be a permanent
member of the marks households and known

129
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:23,221
to Marx.

130
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:26,640
The Prussian government was putting
pressure on the Belgians to kick him out.

131
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,391
As a result,

132
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:31,740
he experienced frustrating delays in his
efforts to obtain permanent residency

133
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,280
in order to get residency grounds that
he had to promise not to get involved in

134
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:38,310
local political issues or a
spouse's pendant school views.

135
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,520
He then proceeded to find loopholes that
would allow him to spread his ideas.

136
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,210
In 1847 he published a treatise
entitled the poverty of Philosophy,

137
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:49,830
which challenged in early
attract by French leftist
Piaget CF Pruett Hall cooled

138
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,150
the philosophy of poverty.

139
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,230
The poverty of philosophy was a stepping
stone towards Marx's most impressive

140
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,720
and famous work,
the communist manifesto.

141
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,200
In order to get direct experience of
the conditions of the working class,

142
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,070
he traveled to England in 1845
along with Friedrich Engels.

143
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,940
They taught factories and slums witnessing
the terrible working conditions and

144
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,100
the even worse living conditions.

145
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,240
After six weeks in England's marks
returns Brussels fully equipped to produce

146
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,300
his magnum opus. Two weeks
later, the 30 page pamphlet,

147
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,800
it was ready for the presses.

148
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,920
The communist manifesto was published
on February the 21st 1848 in it's mock

149
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:28,260
stated that the boards want to see where
their own grave diggers with they're

150
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:30,750
exploited workers, rising
ops, whoever, throw them.

151
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,530
Soon after the manifestos publication,
the second French revolt broke out.

152
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,670
The Monica was cast aside
in the democratic government
was put in place back in

153
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:48,000
Belgium. Mark's was arrested for sub
lessee of activity. Upon his release,

154
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,690
he made the decision to head to
a reinvigorated and Frea France.

155
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,550
The modern families relocation was helped
by the belated that he received from

156
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,560
his father's estate.
Most of that money though,

157
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,600
was poured into starting
another newspaper.

158
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,620
This newspaper was called the Noya
Reinsch Zeitung angles worked on the paper

159
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,480
providing the latest news and happenings
from Europe so you don't have to.

160
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,810
Moving to France marks
joins the communist league,

161
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,440
which had been formed by members of the
Jak among club after the revolution in

162
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:16,350
order to prevent the aristocracy
from reasserting itself.

163
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,650
That methods of doing so well,

164
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,900
so drastic that the time period it
became known as the reign of terror.

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,580
The French authorities viewed
the Communist League as
the re-instituted Jacobin

166
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,480
Club of just under a new name. This
brought official scrutiny upon the league.

167
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,670
With Mark's being arrested several times.

168
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,090
Initially the police were unable to
direct city Lincoln to any subversive

169
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,940
activity and no prosecution
was brought against him,

170
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,660
but things changed when the Prussian
King Frederick William the fourth took a

171
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:46,830
personal interest in stomping out
every leftist movement in Israel.

172
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,490
It didn't take long phase attention to
go to the Paris based leftist newspaper

173
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,230
run by call marks for the second time in
his life. He was expelled from France.

174
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,370
Logs had pulled all of his
financial results is into
the paper with it shut down.

175
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:03,210
He was left with nothing. He only has
enough money to get out of France,

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,970
had to visit a porn shop and
Hawk his family's silver.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,900
He received support from a couple of
German socialists to raise money to help

178
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,620
get marks reestablished. However, the help
center down to be a double edge sword,

179
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,340
the benefactors of painted marks to be
in such a poor demoralized condition in

180
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:21,060
order to scale support that color was
treated as a laughingstock when he

181
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,910
returned. Mark's was not
pleased with this reception.

182
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,930
He stated that the greatest financial
difficulties are preferable to public

183
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,650
begging. Now, just before
we get into monks is moved
to London in his later life.

184
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,490
I want to tell you a bit about today's
sponsor and that's been Sarah watchers.

185
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,160
I'm wearing of INSERRA watch right now.
This is a Vin,

186
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:42,510
Sarah chronic often as well as keeping
perfect time. It's also got a time.

187
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,330
You see the three battles there.
They look great,

188
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:49,530
but they also serve the timer function
I picked down to watch with blue and

189
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,560
silver, but they're all loads
of options on their websites.

190
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,100
You'll be sure to find something that
suits your style and your risk size.

191
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,620
As I mentioned before,
I have tightness or risk.

192
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,460
Say they even sorted me out with a
smaller model and it fits perfectly.

193
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,700
I've had this watch for a few months.
I took it on holiday with me.

194
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,050
I've been putting it through its
paces and now I am not a supercap.

195
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,670
We'll watch owner say the least, but it
still looks in great condition. Vince,

196
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:16,980
Sarah Watches belief that luxury is
all about price or specification.

197
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:20,340
It's about detail and craftsmanship
and they'd been Saturday or watches.

198
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
They've got a ton of that.

199
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,020
Unlike many other watches on the market
and Sarah isn't about minimalist style.

200
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,900
It's about the classic
good look of a watch,

201
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,850
which is something that I personally love.

202
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,860
This is what really sets
it apart from others.

203
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,530
Feather by selling direct to the
consumer of INSERRA can deliver.

204
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:38,190
A Great Watch is about a 10th of
the price that you might expect.

Let's get back to Mark's

208
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,920
in June of 1849 the Mars family or fought?
Relocated. Yes. Again, the destination.

209
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,080
This time it was London,
England.

210
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,800
It was that final move with a famous
German spending the rest of his life

211
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,890
amongst the English. Not long after
the marks is settled in London,

212
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:11,830
the disbanded French Communist
league reformed in the city,

213
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,520
the leaders of the movements wanting to
bring about an immediate revolt of the

214
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:16,780
working classes in London,

215
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:21,460
which would ideally then spread it across
the entire continent box viewed these

216
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:24,760
goals as unrealistic and labeled the
leaders of the communist league as

217
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:28,600
unrealistic dreamers. He was firmly
convinced that the overthrow would come,

218
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,760
but believed that it
had to evolve gradually.

219
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,360
He wasn't even concerned if the revolution
didn't come in his own lifetime.

220
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,500
He was happy to plant the seeds but
would come to fruition at a later time.

221
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,401
As it turned out,

222
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:43,570
the first communist revolution that didn't
happen for another 68 years in London,

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,330
Mark's focused on bringing
reforms on a smaller scale.

224
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,380
He champions the rights of the poor and
advocated for voting rights and freedom

225
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:52,270
of speech.
For the first few months in London,

226
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,900
the marks family were among the poor
of London only surviving thanks to the

227
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,230
financial support provided by
Friedrich Engels, the financial strain.

228
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,310
It was lifted in 1851 when mark secured
a position as a European correspondent.

229
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,520
For the New York Daily Tribune at the
stoss and goals had to translate the

230
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,170
articles that Marx wrote before.

231
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,500
Long call taught himself English and
was able to translate for himself.

232
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,071
At the time,

233
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:15,400
the New York Daily Tribune was the most
widely read newspaper and all of the

234
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:16,240
United States.

235
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,620
The paper paid him 200 pounds per year in
order to provide two articles per week.

236
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,190
Still, it was never quite enough and
the family struggled to make ends meet.

237
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,930
In 1852 marks was concerned with what
was taking place across the English

238
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,260
Channel. The second French Revolution
had erupted and a new Napoleon,

239
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:36,280
the nephew of the first seized power
establishing itself as the new emperor

240
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,760
longs was frustrated at how the French
working people goods allow another

241
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,770
dictator to rule over them.
He wrote a book,

242
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:44,170
calls the 18th Broomer of Louis Napoleon,

243
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:47,800
which mocks the new emperor
in as he placed the blame
on both the French working

244
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:51,520
class of being sucked in by the dictator
and on the proletariats being gullible

245
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:54,730
to Napoleon's promise to keep
the masses in check and his book,

246
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,840
he summed it up this way.

247
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,350
The struggle seems to be settled in
central way that all classes equally

248
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:03,880
impotence and equally remote fall on
their knees before the rifle butts.

249
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,290
As a correspondent for the
New York Daily Tribune,

250
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,430
Marx was in a unique position to give
an outside perspective on the American

251
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:17,210
civil war.

252
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,980
He predicted that the election of
Abraham Lincoln would lead to civil war,

253
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,130
that the war would greatly impacts the
British economy with its textile industry.

254
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,920
Relying on exports of cotton
from the American south.

255
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,400
He was right on both counts with the
slowdown in trade being at times the cost

256
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,230
and the famine.

257
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,430
Many British factory workers lost their
jobs providing the British government.

258
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:40,430
We have the incentive to provide financial
aid to prop up the confederate cause

259
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,550
Mark's was quick to point out the
hypocrisy in Britain's position.

260
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,200
Having outlawed slavery itself.

261
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,460
Person was now supporting the slave owning
southern states in order to boost our

262
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,670
own economy. Is articles published
in the Tribune without the,

263
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,120
until the paper changed its pro
abolitionist stance and again,

264
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:59,630
calling for an immediate cessation
of hostilities from now on,

265
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,350
articles tend to be neutral in that tone.
This was a disaster from mark,

266
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,450
so you run willing to
compromise his principles,

267
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,050
tendered his resignation once more.
Karl Marx was unemployed.

268
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,040
It was terrible timing with financial
pressures having mounds it even before his

269
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,750
leaving the paper.
On top of that,

270
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,200
Jenny was sick with about of a
small box with nowhere else to turn.

271
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,660
Box sought relief from Friedrich Engels.
However,

272
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:24,510
Bengals was grieving the recent death of
his wife and that has it from cholera.

273
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,840
Requesting relief was not taken kindly.

274
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,230
After three days of stewing on the matter,
he sent the following reply,

275
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,610
you will find it natural.

276
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:35,270
That's my own trouble and your frosty
reception of it made it positively

277
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:39,650
impossible for [inaudible] all my friends,
if Shane me on this occasion,

278
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:44,120
which was bound to touch me very nearly
more sympathy and friendship than I

279
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,954
could expect.

280
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,980
You found the moment suitable to enforce
the superiority of your cold thought

281
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,814
processes.

282
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,450
Mark's was surprised and upset that
he had unwittingly insulted angles.

283
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,240
He quickly wrote back and the process
giving us insight into just how desperate

284
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,030
to situation was wrote.

285
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,300
My wife and children will bend the
witness that when you'll let it came.

286
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,200
I was much shattered by the death
is one of those nearest to me,

287
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,940
but when I wrote to you in the evening,

288
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,090
which was under the impression
of very desperate conditions,

289
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,980
I had the landlord's broker in the house,

290
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:17,330
the butcher protesting my cheque shortage
of coals and foods and there's little

291
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,470
Jenny in bed in such second senses.

292
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,550
I can generally save
myself only by cynicism.

293
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,420
The two men quickly made up and then
goes once more provided financial support

294
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,970
to keep the marks family
afloat. Before long. However,

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,050
Mark's faced a new crisis while his
wife's health improved has earned again to

296
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,230
deteriorate.
Suppose the rubs it all over his body.

297
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:45,290
You causing great pain and discomfort he
suffered on as he completed his latest

298
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,940
work does capital. The work was
published in Berlin in 1867 and it's,

299
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,020
he emphasized the surplus value of Labor
into the impact of that machines would

300
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,990
have on the workforce.
Does capital was a success,

301
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,620
but that didn't translate to financial
stability for the ever a struggling

302
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:01,451
family walks.

303
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:05,240
His mother once made the saint and
comments if only Carl had made capital

304
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,660
instead of just writing about it.
When Mark's,

305
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,240
his daughter Laura got engaged to a
struggling medical students named Paul the

306
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:11,750
fog.

307
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,290
Have protective father sought to save
her from the same mistake her mother had

308
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,940
made marrying a man who was
ill prepared to Katha hot.

309
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,830
He strongly objected to the marriage only
relenting when he gains the assurance

310
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:24,380
that the young man was able to
care for his daughter financially.

311
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,910
By 1869 marks was actively working as
an ambassador for an organization called

312
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,860
international working man's association,

313
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,310
which endeavored to bring the world
of communism together under a single

314
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:34,940
umbrella.

315
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,990
In 1870 France declared war on Germany
among the international working men's

316
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,160
association that was a division between
those who are in favor of the war and

317
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,150
those who were against it.

318
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,170
Mark's was keying for Germany to give the
Frederick good drubbing believing that

319
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:51,600
it would lead to the resurgence
of socialism in France
following the defeat of

320
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,980
Napoleon. The third a coalition
of international workers,

321
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,470
members and French citizens combined
state control of Paris. After two months,

322
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:01,980
they were overthrown by the French
authorities. In our short period of time,

323
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,100
mark saw the embodiments
of his proletarian revolt.

324
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,140
It's overthrown by the establishment,

325
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,250
convinced him that the working class
cannot simply lay hold of ready made state

326
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,540
machinery and wield it for its own
purposes for a takeover of power to be

327
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:20,220
successful marks reasons there had to
be an existing infrastructure ready to

328
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,060
replace the old one.

329
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,710
For the last decade of his life,

330
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:32,580
Comark struggled with health problems and
financial survival. During this period.

331
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:36,480
He produced just one work of note in
which he commented on what he terms the

332
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,400
dictatorship of the proletariat.

333
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,120
He expressed his firm belief that the
mass is needed to work together in the

334
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,140
coming revolution without allowing for a
dominant leader to rise. Unfortunately,

335
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,430
that is precisely what happens in many
of the Communist revolutions of the 20th

336
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:55,260
century. On December the second 1891
Carl's lifelong companion Jenny died.

337
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,770
She had been in terrible pain with
cancer of the liver for months.

338
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,810
Her last words to call or good indicating
that she was happy that her pain was

339
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:07,830
it an end following Jenny's death marks
fell into a deep depression at the

340
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:09,930
prompting of his lifelong
friend and Friedrich Engels.

341
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,660
He took a holiday to Algiers.
After two months,

342
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:15,810
he returned to England just as he was
beginning to get back on his feet.

343
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,650
He received another blow when his daughter
Jenny Caroline died of bladder cancer

344
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:24,330
at the age of 38 with the loss of his to
Jenny's Marx gave up the will to live.

345
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,110
He hung on for another two months
racked by pain and living in poverty.

346
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,980
The end game on March the 14th 1883
when his bodies to come and to do a

347
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:35,460
combination of bronchitis and pleurisy.
The man was gone,

348
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,990
but his ideas continues and they had a
massive impact on the coming century.

349
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,330
