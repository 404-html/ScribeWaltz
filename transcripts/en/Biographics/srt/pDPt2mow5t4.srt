1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,050
The real life exploits of Liana does
have spotter and his 300 warriors at

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:08,160
Thermopylae have given rise to the
myth of the spot and superhero.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,580
These supremely disciplines,
man of few words who had a body of steel.

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:15,330
It could endure any hardship and
would fight to his last breath.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,720
It's not Japan really did exist
and chief among them was Leon Idus,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,640
the spartan king who defined the moat of
Persia, saving grease from an isolation.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,180
And this week's biographics,
we discovered the real life Leon at us

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,481
Leona.

9
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:48,480
This was born around 540 BCE and the Greek
city of Sparta at that time at Greece

10
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,920
was made up of hundreds of city states
of which Athens and Sparta with the

11
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,540
largest Leona does his father,

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,330
Alexandra Idis was the king
of Sparta for the Greeks,

13
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:00,960
warfare was fie su-preme
statements of a citizen.

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,490
This is what made a man a man and gave
him his right to be a part of his city.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,170
Every Greek in every city.

16
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:12,171
State was obliged to military service
from the age of 20 until the age of 45 in

17
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:14,790
order to prepare for that life,

18
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,630
boys were put into a military training
camp known as the [inaudible] from the

19
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,770
age of seven. There was only one exception
to this compulsory military service,

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,370
the firstborn son of the
king of each city state.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,550
His upbringing would be focused on
grooming him for the power that he would

22
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:32,320
inherit on his father's
death, Leon. It is. However,

23
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:35,610
it was the third son of Alexandra Eddie's
his older half brother, kilometers.

24
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:38,970
The first was first in line to be
the next king of Sparta. As a result,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,930
Liana just spent his formative years
learning how to be a spartan warrior

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,750
between the age of seven
and the age of 12 Liana,

27
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,770
this underwent a training regimen along
with a group of other boys under the

28
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,760
supervision of a warden who was
called the page and numerous.

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,030
The literal translation
of this is herder of boys.

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,080
This was a highly respected spot and
drawn from the highest social class.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,340
Here's all authority, allows him to punish
anyone who misbehaved and to this end,

32
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:09,360
he was accompanied by a whip wielding
squad of you this who were ready to meet

33
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:13,950
out as punishments as the system was
designed to produce effective warriors,

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,640
great emphasis was placed on
a rough and tumble lifestyle.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,990
The boys were divided into bands and they
chose as their leader the best fighter.

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,110
Meanwhile, the predominance would
keep a close eye on their antics,

37
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,170
meeting out punishment to anyone who got
out of line as well as in boy is in the

38
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,610
aggregate. We're not permitted to wear
shoes. It was believed that leaping,

39
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,060
jumping, and running were accomplished
more swiftly and barefoot.

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,810
The boys were also allowed just
one cloak throughout the year.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,450
This was designed to force
them to grow accustomed.

42
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:46,660
Steve Sweltering Summers and freezing
winters making do with what little

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
covering they had.

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,080
Food for the boys was strictly rations
on the belief that a lean hungry man

45
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,230
fights. It's far more effectively
than a fat satiated one.

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,130
Also being able to go a long time without
food, which make for a better prepared.

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,130
Fifth's was also severely punished
unless it involved the stealing of food.

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,520
The logic behind this was that
by at lending to pilfer food,

49
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,240
the boys would be practicing the skills
of foraging that would be needed when on

50
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,510
a military campaign as well as
that training to become Boreus.

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,750
The bodies were also taught
to read and to write. In fact,

52
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:20,950
the Spartans gained a reputation as men
of learning who love to music, poetry,

53
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,670
and dance.

54
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,360
The age of 12 was an important watershed
year in the life of a young spartan.

55
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,830
He was now placed in a band of about a
dozen of his peers in order to live under

56
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:34,240
the headship of one drawn from his ranks.
This was the Aaron or prefect.

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,110
The one chosen was the smartest,
the most battle ready and cunning.

58
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,380
Though there is no record that
Liana just was put in this position,

59
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,040
it is quite likely that he being the son
of the king and it's given the future

60
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,510
battle prowess that he displayed did
indeed serve as an Erin during his teen

61
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:53,740
years. The other boys had to give
the absolute obedience to him.

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,400
They were to act as his servants
collecting firewood and it's fettering

63
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,650
vegetables using their thieving skills.

64
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,790
Also at the age of 12 spartan boys were
taken under the wing of an Erastus or

65
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,170
admirer to receive a form of mentoring
whereas another Grecian city states this

66
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,940
relationship was a sexual one.

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,870
This was not the case in spotter desire
for the body rather than the soul of a

68
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,600
boy who was considered to
be the height of shame.

69
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,490
At the age of 18 the Spartan
youth became a malaria, a title,

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,450
which means he is nearly an errand.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,140
His military training was now stepped
up cause he came close to entering

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,280
military service.

73
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,370
And so already by the age of 20
spots in society has molded me,

74
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:36,371
honored us into an agile battle ready
military machine full of self confidence,

75
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,470
discipline.
And to killer instincts.

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
He was ready to make his
mark on the field of battle.

77
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,130
Leon Anders had trained to
be a hoplite warrior. Cop.

78
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,130
Lights were experts in using the short
iron sword and round shield and spear.

79
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,990
They fought in a tight phalynx formation
in which they would approach the enemy

80
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:57,070
with the shield overhead to form a
tortoise like shell in order to defend

81
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,520
themselves from oncoming arrows.
Just as Liana just was a bouncy,

82
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,120
went to military service, news reached
him that his father, the king had died.

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,340
His brother therefore
inherited the throne.

84
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,020
So while one brother took on the mantle
of supreme ruler over the city state,

85
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,770
the other inherited the role that
he had been given his entire life.

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,570
That of a spartan warrior.

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,950
The Spartan army was divided into age
groups spanning 10 years within these

88
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:24,730
divisions, and the basic grouping of men
was into mass groups of about 15 men.

89
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,840
It was with these men that Liana does
lived during his twenties it was also

90
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,140
around this time that Liana does married
the daughter of his half brother.

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,350
She was named Gorgo and was, by
all accounts, a beautiful lens,

92
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,540
politically astute woman.
After a few years,

93
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,000
they had a son who they
named Cleon Veritas.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,800
My 490 BC, things were not going well
fully on a distance older half brother.

95
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,270
Over the last three years,

96
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:00,110
Grecian city had one by one
succumbs to the invading Persians.

97
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,400
The capitulation of these powers was a
source of outer to the proud spot and

98
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:08,720
king, and in 491 the SMT do
overthrow a neighboring king.

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,790
It was about two conceit to the Persians,

100
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,420
but when they're kings blands do Alster
duly appointed fellow king were revealed

101
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,460
the people of Sparta.
We're not happy and it's clear.

102
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,260
Manez was forced to flee the city.

103
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,160
He then set about gathering a formidable
army and the surrounding territories

104
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,560
wisely.
The Spartans allows him to return,

105
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,430
but believing that the king had gone
insane, hadn't thrown into chains.

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,840
Apparently this order was carried out
on the direction of Lialda spill on his

107
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,990
was placed under the gods
of the heloc slave class.

108
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,590
The imprisoned king managed to persuade
one of his capitalist to lend him his

109
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,401
dagger with,

110
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,360
as he apparently committed and appalling
sort of Harry Carey slicing himself

111
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,110
into pieces from his feet with when
Claremont has it taken the throne in 30

112
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,150
years. Previously has half-brother Doris
who was older than Leon [inaudible],

113
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,510
was sense that the throne had passed him
by finding it impossible to remain in

114
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,590
Sparta. You attempted to establish
a colony in Africa when this fails.

115
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:04,490
He went to Sicily where he ultimately
met an untimely death and so it was that

116
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,060
on the death of clear Mendez
in 1490 in Leon at us,

117
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,420
it was the next in line for the throne

118
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,420
immediately upon ascending to the throne,

119
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:24,540
Leon and this was thrown into
the heat of conflict for years.

120
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,770
The Persians had been at threatened in
Greece and now the situation was that a

121
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,650
critical point,
swift action was needed ans neon.

122
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,170
It just proved to be the
right man to deliver it.

123
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,860
The goal of the Persians was the
absolute subjugation of Greece.

124
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,820
They already ruled over a number of
Greek cities on the coast of Asia.

125
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,750
The continued existence of other Greek
city states was a beacon of light for

126
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:49,680
those already in Gulf to by the Persians,
making them dream of independence.

127
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,020
This was simply not acceptable
to the Persian king,

128
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,940
Xerxes to crush old Grecian resistance
succes and gathered together a massive

129
00:07:56,941 --> 00:08:01,941
force consisting of 1,207 warships and
as many as 1.7 million warriors in stark

130
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,000
contrast, the Greeks were badly disunited
of more than 100 city states. So neat.

131
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,970
31 had agreed. Do you stand
and fight against the Persians?

132
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,590
The kings of these 31 states met and
swore an oath to fight the Persians and to

133
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:19,320
punish any cities that went
over to the Persian side.

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,500
Still with the key states of facily
and by ots supporting Persia,

135
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,270
there was no active resistance to the
invaders right down to the city of Athens.

136
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,690
The Spartans had taken on the mantle
of leadership and the resistance.

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
The city was recognized as
being in a position of moral,

138
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,630
political and above all
military preeminence in all
of Greece. Under the Oneidas.

139
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:43,670
The Spartans were absolutely determined
to fight in order to conquer or die the

140
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:48,690
alliance with other resisting city state
so loudly on it as to put around 60,000

141
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:52,710
men into the fields getting sacked sees
of Persia believed that his overwhelming

142
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:55,200
superiority in numbers
would guarantee the victory.

143
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,500
It was his strategy to keep his naval
fleet and does infantry closely connected.

144
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,330
The infantry thus marched along the shore
and so the Persians even dug a canal

145
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,180
through Mount Athos do allow
the ships to stay close.

146
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:11,181
When the army got inland's by August the
18th 480 Xerxes had overrun Macedonia.

147
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,960
Vaseline is army now.

148
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:16,650
It arrived at the place they called
Thermopylae and narrow pass between facily

149
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:17,484
and the ocean,

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,690
and the auditors knew that he could
never defeat the entire Persian army,

151
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,860
but he believed that if he could inflicts
a devastating blow of such magnitude

152
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,440
that it decimated a portion of that army.

153
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,300
The psychological damage would be such
that the Persians would withdraw that not

154
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:37,100
everyone was convinced that this strategy
would actually work. Not Undermining.

155
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,230
The honor does a strategy was
the article of Apollo at Delphi.

156
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,910
This was a person who was considered
to have a hotline to the gods of Greece

157
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,720
when the Spartans had approached the
article asking whether they should resist

158
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,680
the Persians there apply that came
back was either the king of Sparta,

159
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:57,150
ms die or the Spartans themselves must
be conquered for nothing can stands

160
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:01,240
before the mice of the Persian king.
Each successive city states that approach.

161
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,630
The article was likewise
given a premonition of
doom. Still they honored us,

162
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,810
was not deterred.

163
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,220
He ends every Spartan Warrior with him
would give his last breath to keep the

164
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:14,400
Persians out of their beloved
city state they wanted us to do,

165
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,040
wants to meet the overwhelming
Persian force on the open fields.

166
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,540
It was his intention to withdraw to the
spot where the Peloponnesian Peninsula

167
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,850
joins the lance of Attica.
This was a very narrow strip of land,

168
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,660
just a mile and a half long.
Here.

169
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,190
He would set his men to
building a defensive wall
behinds which they would find

170
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,430
sexy says Ami.

171
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,880
The bowling with his plan was that
it left Athens completely without any

172
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,510
protection. So against his
better judgments, neon adjusts,

173
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,570
agreed to take a small force up to
Thermopylae and engage the Persians at the

174
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:46,110
narrowest point of the past. Here,
the great advantage of the Persians,

175
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,440
the use of cavalry would be negated.

176
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,171
All know,

177
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:03,010
just decided that 300 Spartan warriors
would be selected for the defense if the

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,390
modeling and they would be led by
he himself. So the question is now,

179
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:12,391
why would just 300 chosen
and why particularly these
301st 300 was a manageable

180
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,880
number for an elite task force.
Secondly,

181
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:20,650
the figure 300 had a strong symbolic and
it's practical overtone in Sparta as it

182
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,920
was the fixed number of
the regular royal body art.

183
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,080
The body guards were known as cavalry men,

184
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,800
though they in fact served as infantry
men in the dead center of a hoplite

185
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,740
Phalynx. This was where the
commanding king would be stations.

186
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,460
The three injured cavalry
men were especially selected
in an intense competition.

187
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,020
They were selected from the men in the
10 youngest adult citizen year classes

188
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,520
age between 20 and 29
Liana just is the moppet.

189
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,420
The advanced guard of 300 however,

190
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,980
was to be selected with one crucial
additional criteria besides being

191
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:52,450
exceptionally brave skill for them.

192
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,350
Patriotic each of the chosen
few must have a living son.

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,580
This would ensure that his son would be
in place to carry on his father's name.

194
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,500
These as within constitutes an elite
within an elite bursting with pride to

195
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,540
emulates the feet if they're late fathers.

196
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,920
In addition to the 300
Spartans and he honored us,

197
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:14,530
stuck around for thousands Peloponnesians
and around a thousands noncombatants

198
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,300
ups.
It is clear for the firm,

199
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:19,480
obsolete 300 words would be
in effect a suicide squad.

200
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,710
The parts of the firm opoly has a flat
plane in front of us and that was where

201
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,950
the Persians were encamped the pass
through the mountains to the sea.

202
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,240
It was only six feet wide at points at
the points where the past wade into 50

203
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:31,630
feet.

204
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,800
The Spartans set about repairing and
existing wall and making it a much more

205
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,910
defensible location.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,200
After Xerxes is vast passion and
forces arrived at the past as west,

207
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,200
and then a three or four day delay
occurred before he launched his assault.

208
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,820
In this pre battle pause,

209
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,970
it is reported that Xerxes
sends a message to Leon at us.

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,280
He demanded that he handed over his arms.

211
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,030
There's spartan king replied
in just two words, Milan Laba,

212
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,090
which essentially means
come and get them yourself.

213
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,270
It was also during this low before
the storm that the Persian advanced

214
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,690
reconnaissance reported back
to Xerxes the strange behavior.

215
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:08,590
They saw it among the Spartans rather
than being anxious if the coming attack,

216
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,290
the Greek warriors
appeared supremely at ease.

217
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,130
They busied themselves with bathing,
braiding one another's hair and dancing.

218
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,570
The Persians interpreted this as signs
of fear induced madness until they

219
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,950
traitorous Greek in their midst,

220
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:25,600
informed the king that the Spartans were
certainly not Matt or the Persian spies

221
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,220
had seen where the actions of pound heroes
preparing themselves for their final

222
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,810
life and death struggle.

223
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,830
So the Persian king first sent in the
meets a force of about two thousands but

224
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:38,170
these forces proved no
match for the Spartans.

225
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,290
They wore near the helmets and all grieves
and their shields were made of wicker

226
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,570
work in the confined spaces of the past.

227
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,720
They were unable to take advantage
of their superiority in numbers.

228
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,350
When the Medes unleashed a hail of
arrows on the defenders in unison,

229
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,080
the Spartans lifted their shields over,

230
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,520
had to form a defensive
roof over their heads.

231
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,760
The Medes and the troops that followed
them did the best they could under the

232
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,350
judgmental.
I have their king,

233
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,700
but it was not enough and they
suffered heavy losses. In fact,

234
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,520
losses were so great on three occasions
that Zach sees is said to have a laptop

235
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:10,630
in horror from his specially constructed
throne appalled at the carnage and

236
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:14,590
Sorta of some of his best men behind
the protection of the refurbished wall.

237
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,580
Liana does his men resisted by fighting
and relates this clever tactic,

238
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:22,270
maximize the efficiency outpost of
their limited resources and energies.

239
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,780
Liana does salsa managed to pull
off a series of feigned retreats,

240
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:30,570
followed by a sudden about 10 then a
murderous onslaught on that overconfidence

241
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,240
and distorted Sueess.
Eventually towards the end of daylight,

242
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,710
Xerxes felt that he had no option but
to send in his elite royal bodyguard,

243
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,450
the 10,000 immortals under the
command of he Diana's bus. Once again,

244
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,470
the attack was to no avail and it came
at the cost of serious casualties.

245
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,250
The goal and bloodshed that in Gorge
Dinero Mountain pass was overwhelming.

246
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,800
The piles of quickly
rotting corpses mounted,

247
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,740
the flies swarmed and
the stench was palpable.

248
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,640
The battle raged into a second day
and still is axes was unable to make a

249
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:02,900
breakthrough by now.

250
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,520
Some 20,000 Persians had fallen to the
Greek resistance and the demoralizing

251
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,450
effect on the remains of the Persian
army was telling why could they not turn

252
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,610
back these few simple rentals.

253
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,260
With his frustration of boiling point,
Xerxes finally received his break,

254
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,130
not through his military superiority,
but by means of a traitor.

255
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,910
Xerxes was approached by a Greek term
coach by the name of the fallacies from

256
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,780
the city of malice.

257
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,450
He was very familiar with the
paths crossing the mountain range.

258
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,080
He told the King of another path through
the mountain that would allow the

259
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,990
Persians do bypass the
Greek defensive position.

260
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,040
The Lte is offered to a squat as many as
10,000 Persian trips through that path

261
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,620
by night and turn the
flank of the Spartans.

262
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,530
This Lawson's knew of the existence
of this alternative route,

263
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,430
but they didn't know that Zach season,

264
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:59,870
you have assets Zach sees gave this
special missions you members of the royal

265
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,260
guard of immortals and
it's led by our facilities.

266
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,540
They had set out in silence at nightfall,
aided by full moon.

267
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,800
After a had climb through the ANA
on mountain range up to 1000 meters.

268
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,780
They easily brushed off and bypass the
thousand fish and guards posted by the

269
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:14,931
[inaudible].

270
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:19,190
Notice these troops were ill prepared
and were taken completely by surprise.

271
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,330
We all know just as long been blamed for
not posting a stronger reinforcements

272
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:24,680
on the anti a path.

273
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,710
By the morning of day three of the
conflicts the Persians had the Greeks out

274
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:31,100
flanks. We honored us was now when
a pencil grip caught from the rear.

275
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,120
Now as well as the front,

276
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,690
it is at this point that Liana does
having recognized the hopelessness of the

277
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,500
situation,

278
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,640
gathered his forces together and ordered
all of the trips except the Spartans to

279
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,910
make their escape. Their cities
would need them to fight another day,

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,480
but the Spartans were to make their
last stand right there at Thermopylae.

281
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,500
All melted away except for a
group of about 400 from Thespis.

282
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,260
When asked by the king
why they too did not go,

283
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,890
they replied that they have stayed
because the Spartans of state,

284
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,030
they would die with them.

285
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,330
The Greeks made their last stands
mostly outside the middle of gate wall.

286
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,020
Liana just showed himself a true spartan
with the order that he gave his men

287
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,410
before the final encounter this
evening we shall die in in hades.

288
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,320
This Barton's sold their
souls that are heavy cost.

289
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,760
The Persian losses at the beginning of
day three were reportedly heavier even

290
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,160
from those sustained on
the previous two days.

291
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,570
The Greeks depleted though their numbers
were repeatedly drove the Persians back

292
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,800
then.
Inevitably,

293
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,270
the 10,000 of the Persian royal guard
of immortals emerged from the rear.

294
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,930
The honor this fought and died like a
man possessed when his sword shattered.

295
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,490
After one too many death blows.

296
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,090
He used his hands and his mouth
to inflict injury upon the enemy.

297
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,920
The exact manner of his
death is on recorded,

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,010
but we do know that as soon as he fell,

299
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,120
the Persians took hold of the body and
tried to drag it away. Seeing this,

300
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:50,990
the Spartans lapse on their king and
attempted to pull him back four times the

301
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:51,231
on it.

302
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:54,900
As his body was dragged away before the
remnants of the spot and defenders got

303
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,200
full possession of us and formed
a defensive circle around it.

304
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,760
In this position with that spears and
lances broken their bodies battered and

305
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,260
bloodied and they're dead king,

306
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:07,740
and that missed the Spartans resulted
to throwing rocks at these surrounding

307
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:09,390
force of Persians.
Finally,

308
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,680
a massive head of arrows was launched
and the last Spartans were cut down.

309
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,080
Perhaps the greatest testaments do.
The effectiveness of the heroic defense,

310
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,840
which Leon at us had affected against
the Persians was the treatments of his

311
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:26,760
corpse by so axes, the spartan king was
decapitated and his body was crucified.

312
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,120
So axes then went about trying to hide
the true number of casualties that his

313
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:30,954
men had suffered.

314
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,710
But the great defense by the Spartans
could not be hidden from history.

315
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,820
The death on honored us and his fellow
Spartans greatly lifted the Greek morale

316
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,510
and the vital period that the Spartans
that held up the Persian advance gave

317
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,470
time for the Athenian Greek fleet to
wreak havoc on the Persian navy and

318
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,990
eventually lead to the
defeat of the Persians.

319
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,930
So by giving his life so dearly
at the [inaudible], the owner,

320
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,570
this became the savior of his people.

321
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,250
