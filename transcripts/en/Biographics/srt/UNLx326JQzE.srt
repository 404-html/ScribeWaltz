00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,430
Hello,

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:00,961
every body,

3
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:02,910
just before we get started
into this one today,

4
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:04,890
I do want to say that a
lot of Japanese words,

5
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:06,570
if I scrub the pronunciations,

6
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,560
I did my best.

7
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,450
Have a good at me in the comments
below if you want that spot there for

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,100
me and motive muscle sheet
was the greatest swordsman
you rather come out of a

9
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,970
nation of great swordsman and
that would of course in Japan.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,300
His story which has become the basis for
countless flying swords and an oriental

11
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,310
movies is one of raw courage,

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,780
unbridled ambition,

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,770
and unparalleled mindfulness
in one on one combat.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,750
He defeated 16 opponents,

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,510
yet his greatest legacy is a seminal work.

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,010
The book of five rings,

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,070
which is still poor,

18
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,760
dover by military
tacticians and mindfulness,

19
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:48,870
enthusiastic for 150 years
after it was written.

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,550
In this week's biographics,

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,100
we reveal the man that was Masashi

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,260
there as much uncertainty over the details
and dates pertaining to the life of

23
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,010
Masashi.

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,410
What follows is based
primarily on his own account,

25
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,420
as recorded in the book of five rings,

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,200
me and massage Masashi was
born in the spring of 15,

27
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,770
84 in the village of Mia
Moto in the Yoshino districts
of the Masaka province in

28
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,370
Japan.

29
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,150
He was born into an ability with his
mother who died giving birth to him being

30
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,400
the daughter of a minor local chief Tang.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,450
His father Mooney was a warrior in the
Shin Man Clan who had become an experts

32
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:24,410
in the fighting arts.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,060
He was especially adept at Jujitsu
swordsmanship and the use of the guitar.

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,940
An iron rod with forklift protrusions
when he was in his thirties.

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,620
Mooney had been invited to the capital
of Kyoto to deal with another highly

36
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,760
regarded warrior in the presence of the
Shogun Mooney beat the man in two out of

37
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:41,594
three bouts.

38
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,020
The victory established and massage
his father as he whole show,

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,180
which means without equal in Japan,

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,600
really was intense on teaching his
son everything that he knew about the

41
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:51,440
fighting arts.

42
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,270
Although Misashi it was a quick learner.

43
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,290
He had a stubborn streak that sort of
constantly clashing with his father.

44
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,680
While everyone else treated me with
the utmost respect and reverence,

45
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,740
Misashi would often talk back
and criticize his father.

46
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,300
This resulted in a volatile relationship
which often culminated in violence.

47
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,230
On one occasion,

48
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,010
Muni took a knife and threw it at his
son was actually managed to dodge the

49
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:13,341
weapon,

50
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,080
which buried itself in
the wall beside him,

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,990
but the fathers aren't
get it was not over.

52
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,181
He,

53
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:19,550
through the seven year
old boy out of the house,

54
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,120
essentially disowning
him was actually crossed,

55
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,400
become a soccer pass to the province of
Hiroshima where he traveled to the small

56
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,530
village of [inaudible].

57
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,310
Here he was taken in by his uncle,

58
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:28,850
dearin.

59
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,410
Dearin has once been a warrior,

60
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,750
but he had long ago
renounced the fighting arts,

61
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:36,080
becoming a Buddhist monk and is
living a life of study and meditation.

62
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,960
He raised Misashi at is
small Buddhist temples,

63
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,610
sat on the edge of the village here,

64
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:44,820
the coin lands to read and to write
as well as to meditate and develop the

65
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,710
spirituality,

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
massaging his real passion.

67
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,130
However,

68
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,480
lay with a martial arts.

69
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,610
He spends countless
hours alone in the woods,

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,700
sparring against the unforgiving
trunks of pine trees.

71
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,170
His anger at his being released as he
builds upon the skills that had been

72
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:06,010
instilled by that great worry out
and his work for book of five rings.

73
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,450
Misashi recorded that his first real fight
occurred when he was 13 years of age.

74
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,480
He related that to passing warrior
by the name of Mickey High.

75
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,670
I put a sign up along the Ohio River,

76
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,100
challenging any local swordsman to a deal.

77
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,490
The bolds and impetus Misashi
took up the challenge,

78
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,960
writing his name on the sign,

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,830
key high,

80
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,210
considered the challenge and joke,

81
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:29,320
but accepted any way intent on teaching
the young upstart or lesson ms dot

82
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,450
Ashley's Uncle Doren with sharks.

83
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,170
When he heard what his nephew had
done on the day of the challenge,

84
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,390
she went to head of the
buyer and attempted to beg
us off while he was eating

85
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:41,440
with key high misashi challenged his
opponents with a six foot quarter staff.

86
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,330
He caught off guard,

87
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,470
clubbing him to the ground,

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,280
and then striking him between the
eyes with a succession of blows.

89
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,840
He then beat him to death.

90
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,711
Three years later,

91
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,890
Masashi left Heroku and set off
to make his way in the world.

92
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,360
He traveled along the sand Yoda,

93
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,840
the old high road scouting the northern
shore of the inland sea to the streets

94
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,830
of Shem on Saqib.

95
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,520
From that,

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,540
he ferried across the waters to the port
of [inaudible] and then onto knack at

97
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:04,930
Psu.

98
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,400
This was the castle town,

99
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:10,690
whereas father now lives moody had
entered into the service of the master of

100
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:11,050
Nicodemus,

101
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,830
you causal.

102
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,930
The teenager arrived to
find his father's on me.

103
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,100
We're in the midst of a campaign,

104
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,261
just,

105
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:15,340
uh,

106
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,860
do the islands of shoe and wage war
on the western provinces was actually,

107
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,290
was recruited into the force and soon
found himself fighting alongside his

108
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,070
father.

109
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,080
It was his first taste of war.

110
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,010
The campaign proved to be a great success
with two provinces being brought onto

111
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,680
the dominion of your Shitaka.

112
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,500
Following the campaign with Sashi,

113
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:37,420
his aging father retired from active
duty moving to the nearby port of kids.

114
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,050
Suki.

115
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,530
Yes,

116
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,060
as the father exited from the wells of
mortal Kombat of a sudden it was just

117
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:43,900
getting started.

118
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,800
That campaign,

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,550
it had wet his appetite and he was eager
for more in terms of becoming a great

120
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,590
warrior or swordsmen like his father.

121
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,540
He set out a path forward.

122
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,240
He needed to perfect the
art of swordsmanship,

123
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,770
seek out and defeat other masters and
then found his own school of swordsman

124
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,604
ship.

125
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,460
Never one to think small.

126
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,950
Misashi had set his sights on the most
prestigious school of swordsmanship in

127
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:11,130
the realm the famous
Yoshioka clowning in Kyoto.

128
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,700
He knew that if he could fully
defeat even one member of this plan,

129
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,750
he would put himself on the fast track
to recognition as a master swordsman,

130
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,030
so without saying a word to his father,

131
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,320
he rose early one morning,

132
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,890
collected his few belongings and
set out to claim his destiny.

133
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,880
He bought it his way onto a small
merchant vessel to the port of Sakaki.

134
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,481
From there,

135
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,770
he sat on foot ticket Jojo and
sought out the Yoshioka can.

136
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,220
He threw down his challenge,

137
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:37,560
which was easily accepted
by their top swordsman.

138
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,423
St Jerome.

139
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,880
The jewel would take place
on the grounds of the temple.

140
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,110
What do you really have to the venue?

141
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,570
Masashi leapt upon his
opponent without wanting,

142
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:49,770
just as he had done in his first deal
and felled see jerry with a single blow

143
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:50,700
from his October.

144
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,700
The fight was over before
it had even properly began.

145
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,320
The shock defeat of their top
swordsmen rocked the Yoshioka clan,

146
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,910
so Jira is brother denture.

147
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,900
Chiro was incensed that the manner in
which the young upstart from the south had

148
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,820
attacked his brother
when he was unprepared.

149
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,050
He challenged him it to a second challenge
on the very spot where the first it

150
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:09,620
occurred.

151
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,890
This time there was the Yoshioka
swordsmen who charged first attempting to

152
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:16,310
strike a fatal blow with
this five foot Bako massage.

153
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,150
She managed to wrestle the
weapon away from denture cheery,

154
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,290
using it to beat his opponent to death.

155
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,890
The Yoshioka had now been best
dish twice in short order,

156
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,230
and this was too much
for that honor to bath.

157
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,750
They decided that
Misashi had to be killed.

158
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,140
They devised a plan to ambush him in
the woods outside of the hostel where he

00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,800
was staying more than 100 Yoshioka

163
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,870
and he came up against
Misashi unperturbed.

164
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,890

Overall,

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,380
the Yoshioka fell back,

170
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,240

respected warrior clan in the land.

173
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,280
Misashi returns to Kyoto
in the space of a few days.

174
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:08,900
He had brought down a school
of swordsmanship that had
reigned supreme for over

175
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,500
a century still.

176

177
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,090

He traveled to each city that was
teeming with accomplished swordsmen.

188
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,930
Many of these swordsmen had forged that
talents on the field of battle here.

189
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,560
Masashi opened his own Dojo,

190
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,390

191

It's spread reaching all the way to
ido castle and the shogun himself.

196
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,480
He was invited to teach that,

197
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,870
but declines when he realized that he
would be subject to a member if he hated

Yag.

199

You can after teaching
an ido for seven years,

200

but it's actually decided
to return to could Suki,

201
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,020
the town of his father.

202
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,860
The aging Mooney had set up his own Dojo
and was eager to pass it on to his son

203
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,270
before he arrived back in.

204
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:17,810
Could Suki,

205
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,020
however Musashi wants to fight one
more challenge at his journey home,

Ashima in the streets of Shamona.

208
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,060
Second,

209
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,690
it was here that he was challenged by a
famed warrior by the name of [inaudible]

210
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,733
Congero.

211
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,490
This was a man so fierce
that he understands the
Monica Demon of the western

212
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:35,324
provinces.

213
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,750
He was a master [inaudible].

214
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,480
The greatest Japanese sword.

215
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,910
Legend tells us that massage,

216
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:40,790
she's only weapon,

217
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,690
was a bucket or a wooden sword that he
had carved from an owner of the boat that

218
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,890
had brought him to the islands.

219
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,460
With this,

220
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,680
he managed to subdue and kills the Saki.

221
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,760
We don't immediately jumped into his
boat and rode out to see in order to get

222
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,070
away from Susaki is enraged followers.

223
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,340
Misashi now completed his journey to
Suku where he began teaching at his

224
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,050
father's Dojo for three years.

225
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:04,501
He lived in,

226
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,090
worked in a small seaside village.

227
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,020
During this time,

228
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:10,470
his fractured relationship with his
father had got my better with the old man

229
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,470
criticizing his son's marsh
inability at every opportunity.

230
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,780
When Mooney died at the age of 85,

231
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,480
Masashi was more relieved than saddened.

232
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,580
Shortly after his father's passing,

233
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:23,250
Misashi received a letter
from his former students,

235
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,280
War had broken out between the grades.

236
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,570
Clans have Tagawa,

237
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,020
arends,

238
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,301

241
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,930
along with his eldest son,

242
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,550
who was just 16 years old.

243
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,260
Cotsen already requested the Musashi
serve as part of a special escort of 10

244
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,970
mounted warriors for his son.

245
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,620
The 30 year olds Misashi Solvis as his
opportunity to jump back into the thick

246
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:47,370
of combat.

247
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,860
He sets off from Turkey
to the port of Sakaki.

248
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,340
He was determined to be the protector in
battle of the young son if his beloved

249
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:54,030
students,

250
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,780
he met up with [inaudible] forces
writing at the head of 4,000 men as they

251
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,880
advanced on a soccer and
then on to Kakadu or hamlet.

252
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,250
It's made up of a few farms stretching
along the southern bank of the Yamamoto

253
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,020
River just a few miles down stream.

254
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,300
A lodge enemy force had
gathered that night.

255
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:09,631
However,

256
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:10,390
cats scenarios,

257
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,900
Ami managed to surrounds
the Toyotomi forces.

258
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,820
The attack was ordered at 10:00 PM.

259
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,730
The hour of the snake and the
Toyotomi were sent reeling.

260
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,420
They fled across the river.

261
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,510
I will need to be chased
down by cat scenarios.

262
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,660
Men Misashi was in the lead
wielding his favorite weapon.

263
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,020
The bulk tall records tell us that he
stood on the heights of a bridge sending

264
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,060
one enemy warrior after another,

flying with the deadly blows of his
trusted blocked all the Osaka Windsor in

266
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,100
summer campaigns in which
the Tokugawa were victorious,

267
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,760
but an ends to the resistance
of Japan's western warlords.

268
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,750
The culmination of the hostilities
was the siege of a soccer castle.

269
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,070
It was the largest vessel in which
Masashi would ever take part with many

270
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,070
thousands of worry is being
slaughtered on both sides.

271
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,800
Among those of his comrades
to fall was Naca Galwass.

It was stricken down.

274
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,260
His men had stormed the
southern gate of the castle.

275
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,080
The man had three sons who
traveled with the army.

276
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,000
The two older boys took part in the siege,

277
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,060
but the youngest was just 11
with the death of his father.

278
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,830
The young man now needed a guardian

279
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,600
massaging,

280
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,640
took the boy Minuka Suki under his wing,

281
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,330
adopting him as his son and set
off with the castle town of him a.

282
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:20,860

they want zero.

284
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,170
Who were his stepmother,

285
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,590
lived for the next two years.

286
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:28,400
He lived here caring for
his elderly stepmother while
also providing for his new

287

son many hours each day with spence

had learned as a young boy from his own

289
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:36,560
father.

290
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,330
This tranquil existence was interrupted
when news reached the village of heroes

291
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,640

A castle was going to move.

294
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,270
The new Lord was going to be a Honda.

295
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:47,610
Tomasa.

296
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,160
Masa Masashi saw this change in leadership
as an opportunity for his adopted son

297
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,180
during the storming,

301
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,550

not that Masa agreed as the boy was
made a page to his own son to Tokyo.

304
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,653
At the same time,

305
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,560
Sasha was hired by the
neighboring demio August Sowell,

310
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,264
if it may.

311

gardens and oversaw the construction of

00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,840
a tea house miniature
mountains into miniature lake.

313
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,130
He proved to have a meticulous eye for
detail and was obsessive in getting every

tree shrub and stone placed just right.

315
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,010
The years that he spent to Kashi
were the happiest of massages,

316
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:45,550
life,

317
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,850
as well as planning out the
landscaping and tending to the gardens.

318
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,360
He instructed his retainers in the
art of fighting with two swords.

319
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,140
He also enjoyed hearing of these successes
of his son who grew in favor in the

320
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:57,340
house of Tata Masa.

321
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,630

three month struggle with a disease.

324
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,920
He died at 1:30.

325
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,250
We're so actually knew all too well
what this meant for his son as the key

00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:15,671
retainer.

327
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:20,350
If the stricken Lord Makinos Suki was
customarily bounced to commit ritual

328
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,900
suicide by December ailments,

329
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,740
Makina Suki is death left,

330
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:28,090
a deep emotional scar on Masashi from
which he would never fully recover for

331
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,511
months.

332
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:32,340
He shunned or company retreating to the
forest to commune with nature and tried

333
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:36,670
to come to terms with his great loss
almost exactly a year after Makina souk is

She adopted a second son,

336
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,900
a boy named Laurie,

337
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,520
who was the second son of tomorrow,

338
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,383
is a Mitsui,

339
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,061
a Samurai,

340
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,160
and the service of the
Lord of Mickey Castle.

341
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,950
When their costs had been
overthrown by the Tagawa army,

342
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,461
hit some.

343
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,560
Mitsui took up the life of a poor farmer.

344
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,370
When he died,

345
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,090
his youngest son,

346
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,421
Lori,

347
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,254
became an orphan.

348
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,260
Masashi took it in and arranged for him
to enter the service of Lord Tanzania.

349
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,550
The boy would eventually attained
the rank of senior retainer stations,

350
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,630
only southern islands of can you shoe
Misashi moved to be closer to the boy and

351
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,090
spent the last 20 years of
his life on the islands.

352
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,140
Miss Ashley built a large Dojo on the
islands and soon had a huge following,

353
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,300
all eager to learn from the great master,

354
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,490
even though located on a remote islands,

355
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,750
far from the main centers.

356
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,460
Many martial arts masters visited his
Dojo to experience the art of fighting

357
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,540
with two swords.

358
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,290
The aging the associate was respected
and admired as a great martial arts

359
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,820
grandmaster still,

360
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,540
he was,

361
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,370
as he had always been an outsider.

362
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,470
He did not agree with
himself as was expected.

363
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,780
He left his hair grow long and unkempt.

364
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,230
He also sell them bathed and refused
to wear the traditional attire of a

365
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:38,711
swordsman.

366
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,544
Of that time,

367
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,540
in his waning years,

368
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,130
even abandoned his two swords,

369
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,630
preferring to carry and using nothing
more than a five foot wooden staff in

They numbered more than 20,000
men that has gone to themselves.

375

The long abandoned hardcastle Lord is

when the defenders in selling,

381
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,950
because all three boulders
down from the walls,

382
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,700
he leapt in front of the Lord source
and fended them off with his staff.

383
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,610
Misashi hadn't been back
from the rebellion for long
when he was approaching,

384
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,350

the Dynamo of one of the largest fiefs in

385
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:30,010
the country.

386
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,270
This was Hosokawa Tata,

387
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,140
Toshi.

388
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,700
He wanted Misashi to relocate,

389
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:37,660
to come emoto and instruct his retainers
in the art of fighting with two sorts.

390
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,980
This ultimate accepted,

391

393
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,830
he was given a comfortable mentioned
on the northeastern side of the castle

394
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:45,620
grounds.

395
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,250
Massage,

396
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,750

in the mountains of it
washow where he would while

397
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,910
away the hours in meditation
and contemplation,

398
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,550
he found a cave which
afforded him perfect solitude.

399
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,640
It was here that he began to put his
thoughts to paper in the early spring of

400
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:58,001
16,

401
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:58,660
45.

402
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,930
He completed the first draft of the
work that would make him a mortal down

403
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:02,770
through the ages,

404
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,800
the Gorran no show or book of five rings.

405
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,880
The book had taken five
seasons to complete each one
and seeing the completion

406
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,140
of one long scroll.

407
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,850
He named them for scrolls of earth,

408
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:13,330
fire,

409
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:13,780
water,

410
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,111
wind,

411
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:14,944
and heaven.

412
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,450
Shortly after the completion
of his great work massage,

413
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,480
she's health took a turn for the worse.

414
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,260
Within a month,

415
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,640
he was no longer able to teach.

416
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,100
He withdrew to his house
outside the castle walls.

417
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,480
Feeling is life adding a way.

418
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:28,380
He summoned his chief retainer
and handed in the garden,

419
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,223
no show.

420
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,000
Having passed on his legacy,

421
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,420
he then closed his eyes and allowed
the life to drain from his body.

422
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,620
It was June the 13th,

423
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,191
