1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,230
Bettie page was arguably the most popular
supermodel of the 20th century and she

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:07,290
would go down in history
as the queen of pet up.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,500
Even if you haven't heard of her yet.
Once you know who she is,

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,280
you will begin to see her influence
practically everywhere you go.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,240
If you live in the United States images
and inspired by her still show up in

6
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:21,750
music, videos and movies and
pop culture to this very day,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,700
even if you recognize her face. Very few
people know the story of her real life.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,470
This woman never used her circumstances
as an excuse for failure and then the

9
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,640
amount of grit she needed to overcome
obstacles to achieve her dreams is

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,360
absolutely astounding.
This is the inspirational,

11
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,880
true story of Betty Page.

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,920
Betty Mae. Paige was born on
April the 22nd 1923 in Nashville,

13
00:00:58,921 --> 00:00:59,670
Tennessee.

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,080
She was the second of six children and
the oldest daughter of royal and a page.

15
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,550
Her father was an auto mechanic,

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,910
but he was also an alcoholic and
he had trouble holding down a job.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,200
My mother was a housewife and those
six kids kept to extremely busy.

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,400
During the Great Depression,

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,760
Ryan moved the family around from place
to place because he could never keep a

20
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:22,230
job. He was inflicting all forms of abuse
on his wife and daughters and he often

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,780
cheated on Admin as well.
When Betsy was 10 years old,

22
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,090
her mother finally found the
strength to get a divorce.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,770
Adding the page now had to work full
time even though a few of our kids were

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,620
still just toddlers and babies.
Since she did not have much education,

25
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:37,860
she could only find very low paying jobs.
As the oldest daughter,

26
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:40,620
all of the usual domestic
responsibility fell on Betty.

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,270
She was still only 10 that became the
surrogate mother to a younger siblings by

28
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,650
cooking, cleaning, and babysitting.

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,840
She did all of this cheerfully and
always had a smile on our face. Indeed,

30
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,940
their house became very popular because
after school that neighborhood kids

31
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:57,540
could come over to the house and play
together without any adult supervision.

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,310
That's a loved watching movies and they
were her escape from her harsh reality.

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,170
They inspired her to sing and dance.

34
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,400
In the back yard on a makeshift stage
that the kids made out of discarded scraps

35
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,770
of wood. Since this was
during the Great Depression,

36
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:13,170
the kids did not have many
toys to play with this.

37
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,220
They were entertained by
Betty's imagination as in
as she had an audience who

38
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,470
will eagerly await to
see what she did next.

39
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:23,670
She was always pushing the envelope and
thinking about our next performance,

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,710
but those dreams they would come to a
screeching halt. Even with Betty's helped.

41
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:31,770
Six children was faulty.
Much responsibility for
add nuts and manage alone.

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,270
Even those you worked full time.

43
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,820
The amount of money she
made was simply not enough.

44
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,570
Ryan was not sending her any form of
child support and they simply never heard

45
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:40,404
from him again.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,280
It got so bad that hadn't have to choose
between starvation and giving up some

47
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,290
of our children to an orphanage as he,

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,060
until youngest sister were together in
an old girls' home and she encouraged to

49
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:50,491
assist the,

50
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:54,290
to pretends that they were characters
in a movie like playing pretend to,

51
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:58,230
to help Toronto and Ptosis to stay
strong and resilient through this rather

52
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,620
traumatic experience.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,760
After a few years,

54
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,970
Betty's mother had saved up enough
money and was able to get custody of her

55
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,050
children again.
That's,

56
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,400
he was a few years old now and she had
grown into a beautiful young woman, Edna.

57
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,091
No was concerned.

58
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,050
The Betty might make the same mistake she
did and give up her future by marrying

59
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,430
the first guy who came along.

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,470
So she made a rule that Betty was not
allowed to have a boyfriends but ours,

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,950
like most teenagers, Betty rebelled
in high school. She fell a Billy Neal,

62
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,590
the all star quarterback
from the rival high school.

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,190
He was everything you would imagine of
the stereotypical cool kid back then he

64
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:40,180
wore leather jackets. He rode a motorcycle
to school and probably skipped class,

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,000
just smoke cigarettes.
But that's just speculation

66
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,220
that he fell in love with Billy.
But the years spends in the orphanage,

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,970
they were more than enough for her to
know that she never wanted to depend on a

68
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:55,180
man for her financial security
as their mother had done.

69
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,930
She wanted to get a college education
so that she could always support herself

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,070
if she needed to.

71
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,990
Keep in mind now that in 1940 over 50%
of the u s population dropped out of

72
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,430
school after the eighth grade,

73
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,450
very few women went on to get a high
school diploma mirror and even fewer went

74
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,580
on to attempt to college degree.
If they did.

75
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,220
They usually came from well to
do families in the upper class,

76
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,400
but Betty wasn't going to let
family history stopper afterschool,

77
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,570
but he joins the debate team and
school theatrical productions.

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,050
She studied extremely hard and
graduated second in our class.

79
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,500
This allowed her to win a full academic
scholarship to Peabody's teacher's

80
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,500
college. This was also the moment
that she got married to Billy meal,

81
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,410
even though she's still dreamed
of being a Hollywood starlet.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,320
Billy wanted them to have a
life together in Nashville.

83
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,890
She loved him so much that she didn't
want to break up with him just to pursue

84
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:42,550
her dream.

85
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,210
The next best thing was to
become a teacher since she
would be able to do public

86
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,910
speaking and share her
knowledge with younger kids.

87
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,140
So after getting a bachelor's degree
that he started teaching at her old high

88
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:53,570
school,

89
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,040
have all my principal and teachers
remembered how she excelled in academics

90
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,180
because she was still in our early
twenties and nos all that far off from the

91
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,170
age of our students.

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,550
She was so beautiful that she became a
target of harassment by the young boys.

93
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
The male students thought that
with our perfect hourglass curves,

94
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,340
she was simply too distracting
to be their teacher.

95
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,530
No matter how intelligent
she was on the inside,

96
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:18,540
hardly anyone could see past what she
looked like on the outside of our know and

97
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,210
can take a female teacher seriously unless
she looks like professor McGonagall.

98
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Her husband's Billy Neal joins the army
and they stationed him at a military

99
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:29,020
base in San Francisco before
sending them overseas as his wife,

100
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,290
Betty quit her job as a teacher and
was very excited about the move to

101
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:32,980
California.

102
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,400
She took this opportunity to switch
career paths and got a new job as a

103
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,030
secretary.

104
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,970
One of the men who visited her office
said that she was pretty enough to be in

105
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:43,770
the movies and he offered to help her
get an audition in Los Angeles. Betty,

106
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:46,720
it was excited hoping that this would
be the big break that would make her the

107
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,260
movie star that should always dreamed
of being that he showed up for a screen

108
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:53,380
test by 20th century Fox,
but she hated the experience.

109
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,020
She was poked and prodded by the makeup,

110
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,810
hair and costume to the point where
she didn't even recognize herself.

111
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,690
When she looked in the mirror, they
told her that if she wanted to make it,

112
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:05,090
she would have to change a
lot of things about herself,

113
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,420
like going blonde and doing
a makeup in a different way.

114
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,900
The man who helped her get the screen
test made a move on how promising her fame

115
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,940
and fortune in exchange
for sleeping with him,

116
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,980
but to Betsy turned down his advances.

117
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,940
The men Freston to Ruben had reputation
and promised that he would make sure

118
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,400
that no one ever hot her in Hollywood.
Still,

119
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:26,930
she chose to stay faithful to her husband
and she walked away. But Betty Paige,

120
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,400
she wasn't alone today.

121
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:32,150
We know that the likes of Harvey Weinstein
and Bill Cosby made it a habit of

122
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:36,110
preying on young actresses and that
this was happening to women for decades

123
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:39,050
before as well. Even though she had
been completely faithful to Billy,

124
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,540
he was actually angry to come home and
find out that she was pursuing our acts

125
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,150
in Korea while he was gone.

126
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,990
He wanted it to be satisfied with just
being a housewife and Dee wanted to move

127
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,320
back to Tennessee.
She realized that their ambitions in life,

128
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:55,240
they were completely different and they
were just simply not compatible any

129
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,520
longer and with that they
decided to get a divorce.

130
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,050
In 1947 a 24 years old,

131
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,290
Bessie moved to New York City and began
auditioning for plays and movies and

132
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,760
commercials.
Unfortunately,

133
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,760
she ran into the same problems that
she had in Los Angeles and they didn't

134
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:15,511
charge once.

135
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:19,320
It more than just a talent say in
exchange for her work and she refused to

136
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,510
change a moral compass for three years.

137
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:25,020
She works as a secretary and
Manhattan as the is slipped by.

138
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:28,770
She was now considered to be too old
to start a career in show business.

139
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,330
She had given up everything in order to
be an actress and soon enough it would

140
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,740
be too late.
One day,

141
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:38,550
Betty was walking along the beach on Coney
island's when she noticed a man doing

142
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:42,030
pushups on the beach. This was a
police officer named Jerry tips.

143
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,180
He said that he was a professional
photographer on the side and asked if she

144
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,760
would be interested in being
paid to be a model fam.

145
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,170
After talking to him for a while longer,
she decided to say yes when Tibbs last,

146
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:52,861
how old she was.

147
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,890
She pretended to be in her early twenties
even though by now she was already a

148
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:58,200
27 year old divorcee.
Nowadays,

149
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:02,190
this line about being a photographer
who is inviting a young woman into his

150
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:07,170
basement for pictures is
used by a surprisingly large
number of serial killers

151
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,690
and of course perverts,
but thankfully for her,

152
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,390
the photography sessions went just
as Tibbs said they would just,

153
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,880
and she was paid handsomely for her time.

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,540
Many of her photos began showing up
and girly magazines around Harlem.

155
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,830
Given minds that this was off to world
war two were photos of pinup girls has

156
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,270
become incredibly popular.

157
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,930
A lot of young women at wants it to do
their part to help the troops and even

158
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,790
after the war posing provocative leaf,

159
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,460
a pinup at became a
goal of aspiring models.

160
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,240
So Betty Paige was excited to be part
of this and she had had such a good

161
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:38,250
experience with Jerry Tibbs.
This,

162
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,710
he invited dad to become
a part of a camera club.

163
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,000
In the 1950s Camera Club was where a
studio would bring in a group of models.

164
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,810
Both amateur and professional
photographers would pay
a fee to come and take

165
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:49,950
pictures of beautiful women.

166
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,460
Sometimes men would show up with a
camera that was mts simply because they

167
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:58,230
wanted an excuse to all beautiful women
wearing lingerie up close and personal.

168
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,770
But Betty Page wasn't just
good at modeling. She was
a genius. She needed very,

169
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:06,360
this'll direction from the photographers
and knew how to strike a pose.

170
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,020
Her face was always cheerful,
looking friendly and approachable.

171
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,010
There was something about her that made
men feel that she was the girl next door.

172
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,030
Many of the camera men,

173
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,360
it's often stop taking pictures of the
other girls and spend more time on her

174
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,660
because she was just that good at a job.
Soon enough,

175
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,010
Betty Paige was raking in money and she
made far more than she ever had as a

176
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:30,660
secretary. She saw this as a stepping
stone to finally make it into the movies.

177
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,441
Now today,

178
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,010
it's totally normal for the likes of
Victoria secret angels to be on a strict

179
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:38,490
diet and exercise regimen every single
day to keep themselves fit, but,

180
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,241
but back then,

181
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,900
models usually showed up to have photos
taken of their natural body. Bettie page,

182
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,540
though she didn't rely on a
natural beauty to get the job done.

183
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,820
She works out every day,
watch their diet,

184
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,760
and even so new costumes that
would look good on camera.

185
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,690
She treated it all very
much like a business and
everything she did during heck

186
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:59,160
area was the new standard for what models
would be expected to do in the future.

187
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,000
She began receiving requests to do
photo shoots all over New York City,

188
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,360
and eventually she became a million app.
Whenever it tastes changed,

189
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:10,180
photography is expected Bettie page to
do things that were more and more risk a,

190
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,650
she would agree to do it despite any
previous hesitations that she had in the

191
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:17,730
past. She knew that times were changing
and if she wanted to keep her career in

192
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:20,760
business going, she would have
to begin posing in the nude.

193
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,780
If you think of willingness to pose nude
sounds sort of contradictory when you

194
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,900
consider the fact that she refused
to sleep with anyone to get the job.

195
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,530
She had this to say being in the nude
isn't a disgrace unless you're being

196
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:35,130
promiscuous about is often roll.
When God created Adam and Eve,

197
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,480
they were stark naked and in the gods
into these and God was probably naked as a

198
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,500
Jay bird too.

199
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
So if she continued to pose naked so
long as she thought that it was at least

200
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:44,970
tasteful,

201
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,080
one day the camera club decided to find
a secluded area in upstate New York to

202
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,370
have a nude photo shoot outside where
the models were frolicking in the grass

203
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,640
and it shouldn't be a surprise to you
that the police showed up and arrested.

204
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,960
The women and the photographers.

205
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,710
They challenged the men with disturbing
the peace and the women with indecent

206
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:05,340
exposure that he actually yelled at the
police officers saying that she refused

207
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:08,640
to accept that charge because
she was not an indecent person.

208
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,390
She demanded to have the same challenge
as the men and they finally gave in and

209
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,020
changing it to disturbing
the peace despite having to
serve time in jail for her

210
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:19,440
nude photos. She still continued
to do these photo shoots anyway.

211
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,030
During the peak of our popularity.

212
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:26,031
Bettie page became Ms January in 1955
in playboy magazine who half no one said

213
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:29,880
that he slept with 11 out of 12 of the
cover models of each playboy issue in

214
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:33,610
Betty Page would have been
not one exception who didn't
have to sleep with him

215
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,190
in exchange for being published.

216
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,640
They actually purchased a nude photos
from a female photographer and fellow

217
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:43,470
model named Bunny Yeager
have not respected page
immensely saying that she was a

218
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:48,310
remarkable lady and iconic figure in pop
culture who influenced sexuality tastes

219
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:52,530
in fashion. Someone who had a
tremendous impact on our society.

220
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,300
When the issue of playboy came out,

221
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,470
we can only imagine how her former
high school students, Mr Fellows,

222
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,710
when they opened up the
pages of playboy ends,

223
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,670
figured out that the teacher they once
had a crush on has now done a full spread

224
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:08,170
of nudes in glossy prints. For some,
that was probably a dream come true.

225
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,830
Modeling was paying the bills,

226
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:19,730
but Betty Page still wanted to move in
the direction of being in the movies.

227
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,900
Sibling business partners,

228
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:25,250
Paula and Irving core ran the movie
star new store where they sold beauty

229
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:26,600
photography of pinup models.

230
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,290
They also film short clips of Betty
dancing in lingerie and sold them to

231
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:30,980
customers.

232
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,210
She eventually started in two movies
called Stripper Rama and varieties after

233
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,050
work. Betty was taking acting classes
and auditioning for plays on Broadway,

234
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:43,100
but without much luck.
In 1955 percenters are named as of Alpha,

235
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,790
created a subcommittee that was cracking
down on comic books, pornography,

236
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,700
and it's basically anything else
that could be considered sinful.

237
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,640
The FBI detained Betty
Page and interrogated her,

238
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,990
asking if Irving and Paula claw web
shooting pornographic movies at the movie

239
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:58,040
star new store.

240
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,880
Betty pretested saying that the women
were never fully nude in these movies and

241
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,650
there were never any men in them either.

242
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,610
Betty's boss seven claw was taken the
course before the Senate subcommittee,

243
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,290
even though he was found not guilty.

244
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,490
The mere suggestion that she was starring
in porn ruined about his reputation,

245
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,610
her name, it was printed in
newspapers all over New York City.

246
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,690
Bettie page became the target of slut
shaming and men were yelling at her in the

247
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:23,810
streets. A store could began to center
letters threatening to kill her.

248
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,780
Since she had gotten to know
the FBI agents in New York City,

249
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:28,310
she contacted them right away.

250
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,700
They believe that the person who send
the letters was a known serial killer.

251
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,390
They set up a plan where they used
Betty is bait to catch the murder.

252
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:38,000
Rand's only jumped in at
the last minute to save her.

253
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,150
It turns out that the stalker
was only a 16 year old boy,

254
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,110
but all of this took a serious toll on
Betty's mental health and it was all

255
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:46,150
downhill from that.

256
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,450
In 1957 the savings have to shut down
the movie star new store and Betty Paige

257
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:51,284
was out of a job.

258
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,740
She decided to stop working as a model
and give up her dream of becoming an

259
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,560
actress. She moved to Florida and
became a born again Christian.

260
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,280
The church made her feel like she was
a sinner and that she needed to repent.

261
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,181
While in Florida.

262
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:05,630
She began to attend Bible College and
trying to become a Christian missionary

263
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:09,230
overseas. In the 1960s however, only
found out that she was a divorcee.

264
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,830
They reject it to us saying that she was
to indecent is to represent the church.

265
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,610
She began taking graduate courses to Anna
Masters degree in the hopes that maybe

266
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:19,100
she grew back to being a teacher,
but our reputation.

267
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,400
It followed her there too and
she dropped out. All along,

268
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,480
her mental state continued to decline
and by the 1970s she was beginning to

269
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,710
suffer from schizophrenia.

270
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
She had a nervous breakdown and
ended up in a mental hospital.

271
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,250
After receiving psychiatric treatment
for several years, she was released.

272
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,090
During that time,

273
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,860
she had to be essentially d programs
because the church should brainwashed her

274
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,830
into hating herself and all of our
accomplishments. As time went on,

275
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,380
there was a revival in
interest of a Betty Page.

276
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,470
She had been one of the most
photographed models of the 20th century,

277
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:52,190
and when she retired, she
seemingly disappeared. Explanation.

278
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,370
People wanted to know what had
happened to her and the mystery.

279
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,280
It only added to the
excitement for 40 years.

280
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:02,780
No one had heard anything about
life. After modeling. In 1998,

281
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:06,350
Playboy magazine tracked her down and
asked for an interview. They asked, uh,

282
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:09,040
if she ever felt ashamed of
her work while she was doing,

283
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,530
or if those feelings of guilt came
after she started receiving criticism.

284
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,710
She said, I never thought it
was shameful. I felt normal.

285
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,460
It's just that it was much better than
pounding a typewriter eight hours a day,

286
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,020
which gets monotonous,

287
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,040
or the rest of her life fans and Betty
Page letters telling her how much they

288
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,090
loved and appreciated our bravery for
paving the way for so many other women.

289
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,840
And she finally got the recognition
and love that she deserved.

290
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,000
She died of a heart attack in 2008 at
85 years old. At the time of her death,

291
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,400
she had a net worth of $20 million

292
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,130
even though it was considered to
be very scandalous at the time.

293
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:54,131
That sort of modeling Betty Paige did
is on par with Victoria secrets and the

294
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,770
Calvin Klein ads of today near New Jersey
has become such a big part of American

295
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:01,310
culture that some young women even but
similar photos of themselves on Instagram

296
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,730
without a second thought today,
we'd barely baton eyelid.

297
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,780
That those images of Betty Page
that were deemed to be so sinful and

298
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,643
inappropriate,

299
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,580
one thing is for certain though without
are things wouldn't be the same.

300
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,750
Bettie page is iconic.

301
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,050
Look also became the inspiration for
a number of fictional characters,

302
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,010
including Jenny Blake from a comic
book called the rocket [inaudible].

303
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,230
She also inspired the looks of
celebrities like Katy Perry, Madonna,

304
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,730
and the modern day burlesque dancer,
Dita von Teese. In modern times,

305
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,570
most men have moved on to
having crushes on other females.

306
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:35,780
Celebrities and the photos of Betty
Page may not seem like anything special

307
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,650
today. She is actually now more popular
with women, especially feminists.

308
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,660
She was strong, smart, independent,

309
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:44,300
and never backed down on
what she believed was right.

310
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,880
Even if it took her years
of heartache and struggle,

311
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,450
she was able to make it in the
modeling industry on her own terms.

312
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,250
Even after a death or estate continues
to make tons of money in 2017 oh then

313
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,820
Betty Page merchandise
sold for $7 million.

314
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,530
Her memory will continue to live on as
one of the most iconic women in all of

315
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,950
history. So I already have you found
