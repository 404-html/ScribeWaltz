1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,520
Bolted.

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,050
The Siberian Husky is remembered for
leading a team of sled dogs to deliver

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,610
medicine that saved the town of Nome,
Alaska from a deadly epidemic.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,790
He became a national hero and this
photo was on the front page of every

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:12,930
newspaper in the country.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,760
The statue was erected in his honor in
central park in 1925 and it is still one

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,610
of the most beloved tourist
attractions to this very day.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,000
Many of you might have seen the animated
film by universal pictures and that

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,520
might be all you know about Baltic,

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,140
but the true story is far more dramatic
than what you ever learned from cartoons

11
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:33,270
and children's books.
And in the video today,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,630
we're bringing you the story of Bulto,
the canine hero.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,710
A story begins in the remote town of Nome,

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,210
Alaska in the 1890s the name gold rush
brought prospectors to this small town in

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,730
the hopes of making a rich.
There were no paved roads,

16
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:59,980
so it was incredibly difficult
for people to get around,

17
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:01,510
especially in the winter.

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,590
Many of the people who move to know Matt
to adjust to life in Alaska and they

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,230
became a very tight knit community.
These people,

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,140
they had a lot of respect for one
another because they were all managing to

21
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:13,960
survive in the American wilderness
if anyone was struggling.

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,250
Neighbors helped one another out without
hesitation and it really fostered a

23
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:21,360
close knit community and our
region man named Leon Hart's.

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,930
Seppala owns a dog Kennel in Nome,

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,150
so pilar is creditors that being the first
man to introduce Russia's working dog

26
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:33,151
breed from Siberia to the United States
and they later got the name Siberian

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,270
Husky. These dogs became so popular in
Alaska that he decided to breed them for a

28
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,890
living. He was only interested in breeding
dogs that were light and we're fast.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,970
He became one of the first
men to participate in
competitive dog sled racing in

30
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:46,900
the United States.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,350
One of the many puppies that was born
in Isabella's Kennel was named Bolty.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,440
He was born with Brown eyes and black
with white socks on his two front legs,

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,980
but also it was apparently too large
and it was considered a scrub doc.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,720
Supposed to had him neutered right away
because he was deemed to be at far too

35
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,370
inferior to pass on his DNA.

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,440
Balto was born between the years 1919
in 1923 but no one can be quite sure of

37
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,950
the exact date.
Isabella.

38
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,730
Essentially it was breeding so many
dogs that he didn't really keep track of

39
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:16,570
every puppy that he declared or reject
for all of the other dogs that did not

40
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,230
suit his needs.

41
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,260
Apollo would rent them out to members of
the community to use for building their

42
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:24,130
dog sleds in the Windsor Dog sleds became
the only option for traveling out of

43
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:28,050
town, so trade gold for supplies.
Since so many men traveled to know,

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,740
looking for jobs in the mining industry,

45
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,430
so parlor was able to make a fortune
horrendous thing out as well as selling as

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,920
docs parlors.
Favorite Tasky was called Togo.

47
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,660
He was considered to be a perfect husky
specimen who was incredibly light and

48
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,340
muscular.
As the story goes,

49
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:47,260
Togo was so fast that he could race a
train and when so supposedly he had all of

50
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,180
his time and energy and do training.

51
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,160
This favorite dog offers a
man named Gunnar Carson had
moved from Norway to Nome,

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,200
Alaska to take part in the gold rush.

53
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,980
He paid the rents upon as
dogs do transport supplies
to many were working in the

54
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:04,600
gold mines. There is no record of why
cousin chose bolt to be his lead dog,

55
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,320
but most people believe it was because
he felt some kind of connection from the

56
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,040
start. Most mushers juice a dog to
lead that they know they can trust.

57
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,070
He saw something special in Baltimore
and the decision to take him home,

58
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,170
it was one day you're
going to save his life.

59
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,160
No one was having one of the
coldest winters on record.

60
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,950
Temperatures were reaching
minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit,

61
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,900
which is minus 45 degrees Celsius.

62
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,700
Wins were 50 miles or around 80 kilometers
per hour that were several terrible

63
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:39,630
blizzards that may travel conditions
impossible and most people had no choice

64
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:43,380
but to isolate themselves in their
homes and just stay by the fire place.

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,400
In December of 1924 a record number of
children were going to the only doctor in

66
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,410
town, Curtis Welch. At first,

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,010
Dr. Welch thought that these
children simply had a sore
throat and their parents,

68
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:56,460
they tried to nurse them back to health
over the holidays. A few weeks later,

69
00:03:56,461 --> 00:04:01,230
in January of 1925 two children
unfortunately died. It was at this point,

70
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,920
the Dr. Welch realized that
this was actually a highly
contagious disease called

71
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:08,340
diptheria and did an infected
most of the children in town.

72
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,630
The native Inuit children were affected
the worst because diptheria was a white

73
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:16,650
man's to seize this illness was nicknamed
the strangling angel because the

74
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:20,310
inside of the throat begins to turn to
leather and people can no longer breathe

75
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:23,940
or swallow. Children were far
more susceptible to catching
diptheria than adults,

76
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,750
so parents were watching helplessly as
their sons and daughters were slowly

77
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,610
choking to death. Dr. Welch announced that
all of the children who were infected,

78
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:34,710
it needed to be placed in quarantine
in order to prevent an epidemic.

79
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,870
The cure for diptheria it existed,

80
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,140
but no one was not equipped to
treat such a massive outbreak.

81
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,960
They needed a medicine
called antitoxins serum.

82
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,620
Since Dr. Welch and his four nurses with
the only medical professionals in town,

83
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:49,350
they were working around the
clock to treat those children.

84
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,530
The total population of
Knome was just 10,000 people,

85
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:56,370
and even after placing the infected under
quarantine, it was already too late.

86
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,040
More people that were getting
sick every single day.

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,920
Everyone was afraid that if
the outbreak was not contained,

88
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,340
all of the children may die and it
may spread to the adults as well.

89
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,750
On January the 22nd 1925 Dr. Welch
sent out dozens of telegrams to doctors

90
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:14,400
around Alaska and even sent a message
to Washington DC hoping for the help to

91
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:19,050
get enough antitoxin. They were eager
to help, but the issue was delivery.

92
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,840
The winds were far too strong for
a plane to travel through that,

93
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:26,010
whether it's that was too much ice for
a ship to reach the harbor city where

94
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,470
medicine could be
delivered with anchorage,

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,330
but the train stopped
in a town called Nanana,

96
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,820
which was 674 miles away from Nome.

97
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,180
The only choice was to take sled
dogs across the snowy Iditarod trail,

98
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:38,640
which was normally a 15 to 20 day journey.

99
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,640
There were plenty of obstacles in the
way that slowed down such a journey,

100
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,480
mountains, steep crevasses, and as
the frozen Yukon River, I'll ask us,

101
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:49,080
territorial governor Scott and Boone
approved the plan for the best mushers to

102
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,200
participate in a relay to a
guide that teams of sled dogs.

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,610
The plan was for 20 men and 150 dogs
to wait at checkpoints where they would

104
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,760
pass off the antitoxin to the next team,

105
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,700
so they were able to transport the
medicine as quickly and as efficiently as

106
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,240
possible.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,660
The first men to pick up the antitoxin
at the train station in Nunno was named

108
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,920
at Wild Bill Shannon.

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,510
He traveled for 24 hours straight and
minus 60 degree weather to get to the

110
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,300
first checkpoint and other of the mushers.
Bill Mccarthy,

111
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,440
you came prepared with this,

112
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,250
our moccasins for his dog's feet so that
they wouldn't have to walk on the ice

113
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,130
with that bear paws.
Land on Zapala volunteered stick,

114
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,490
the most dangerous part of the journey
since he had the most experience,

115
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,390
but he was very concerned with going fast
and ordering his dog to go as fast as

116
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,110
he could, just like you would in a race.
He saw a man called Henry Ivan off,

117
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,990
stopped on the trail because he was
struggling with disobedient dogs.

118
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,530
A parlor chose to ignore him and
sped past, instead of offering help,

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,370
Ivan offensive runoff to Sapelo housing,
the serum, the serum, I have it here.

120
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,120
Thankfully it's Apollo hurt him and it
was able to turn this state around and

121
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,260
pick up the medicine,
but his need for speed,

122
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,770
it very nearly blew the entire mission.

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,340
Since Dr. Welch should send telegrams
all over the country a few days earlier,

124
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,420
stories of the epidemic we're
being printed in newspapers
in the lower 48 states.

125
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,111
This story,

126
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,470
it was gripping and it was tragic and
it could have been right out of a novel.

127
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,130
Unbeknownst to the 20 minute people all
over the United States began to hope and

128
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:10,190
pray that they would make it
just days before this happens.

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,520
Hardly anyone had even heard of Nome,
Alaska Butts.

130
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:17,570
Once they knew so many young lives were
at stake, everyone was rooting for them.

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,290
Gunna Carson had taken the Iditarod trail
together with Balto several times on

132
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,241
their supply runs,

133
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,700
so we volunteered to be one of the 20
men that helped retrieve the medicine.

134
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,100
Unlike land how'd Cipolla
and the other men,

135
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,620
Carson did not compete in dog racing,

136
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,470
but also was his pat when
they weren't working together.

137
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,290
Carson was very quiet and
shy around other people,

138
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,530
so [inaudible] was his best friends
and he knew he could rely on him.

139
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,830
Karsten was considered to be a novice
compared to the rest of the crew.

140
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,380
Therefore, he was given one of
the easiest legs of the trail,

141
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,370
but also in constant really did lead a
team of underdogs in more ways than one,

142
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,780
but no one could predict what
was gonna happen next. Well,

143
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,240
going to cost and was on his leg of
the journey, a terrible storm again.

144
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,600
Each one of the checkpoints stations
received a message that the serum and run

145
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,180
was temporarily canceled
because it was too dangerous,

146
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,020
but constant was already in the
wilderness with all of the antitoxin.

147
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,130
When the visit hit, he obviously had
no way of getting the memo. Also,

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,100
there was nowhere for him to take
shelter until the storm blew over.

149
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,750
The blizzard caused a White House.

150
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,250
Carson could not even see his hand
in front of his face. That's alone,

151
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,220
have a sense of direction.

152
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,780
He stopped moving for two hours cuddling
next to bolt the rest of his sled dogs.

153
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,530
He was hoping that the storm would
pass and they could carry on. However,

154
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,340
he could not stop thinking
about the children in the
hospital with every passing

155
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,550
minute and other child could die without
the medicine and if he waited much

156
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:44,610
longer, it was likely that they
would not survive the night.

157
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,660
He decided that his only option was to
move forward despite not being able to

158
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,960
see anything gonna cost and had to
put all of his faith and his dog.

159
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:55,760
Baltic dogs have a far better sense
of direction than humans. Balsa,

160
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:58,800
who had been through the trail many
times before the dog was leading the way,

161
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,220
using a census to guide the rest of
the team to why they needed to go.

162
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,320
At one point they were
hit by a wind tunnel.

163
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,360
It was so strong that it
knocked over the sled.

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,790
The medicine went flying
into a large snowbank.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,290
Carson could not find
it for a very long time.

166
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,550
He got down on his hands and knees and
he started digging through the snow

167
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,610
before he finally found the antitoxin.
Also in the team,

168
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:19,680
they finally reached a
town called port safety,

169
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,140
which was the next checkpoint
and the relay. However,

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,230
he arrived in the middle of the night
and since the next musher had been told

171
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,430
the relay was canceled,

172
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,850
he and the dogs had fallen asleep
with just 12 miles left to go.

173
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:33,120
Carson decided to push through the
last leg of the journey himself.

174
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,290
When they arrived back in Nome,

175
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,160
it was five 30 in the morning and he went
straight to Dr. Welch once the vaccine

176
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,670
thought he was able to administer it to
the infected children and they will made

177
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,540
a full recovery.

178
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,070
Soon after arriving back in Nome,

179
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,460
journalists from all over
the United States began to
contact going to Carson and

180
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,760
asked for an interview so that they
could hear the story of his near death

181
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,190
experience, bringing the
antitoxin to the sick children.

182
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,880
He was always humble and downplayed his
involvement in securing the medicine.

183
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,620
He says to the other drivers and dogs,
the most creditors do.

184
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,520
They're the heart and mush
more difficulties for them.

185
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,440
I know I can say yes for myself.

186
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,140
We were glad to serve
Americans all over the country.

187
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,210
They wanted to meet ball too,

188
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:17,700
and children love listening to the
story of this real life. Dog Hero.

189
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,400
Balto was invited to the
Biltmore hotel in Los Angeles.

190
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,730
Gunner Carsten agreed to the interview
and he was shocked to see movie stars

191
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,650
showing up to have their
picture taken with the dog.

192
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,430
Normally a national hero is welcome
to Los Angeles with keys to the city,

193
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:33,000
but Balsa was given the boons to the
city and stat paramount pictures,

194
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,661
hard hardball too,

195
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:37,520
and going to Carson to star
in a dramatized documentary
gold bolters rest at

196
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:41,460
noon. It became a blockbuster hit in
1925 they made copies of the film,

197
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:45,510
but there was a studio fire in the
1930s the destroyed them all. So sadly,

198
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,190
this movie no longer exists.

199
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,850
They traveled by train across the whole
country and in December of 1925 they

200
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,230
arrived in New York City.

201
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,740
Balto was put on stage on Broadway
for a week and a Vaudeville show.

202
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,850
He also posed for a sculptor who created
the bras statue that stands in central

203
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:03,270
park. There was a ceremony
that unveiled the bolt statue,

204
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,080
which included a plaque that said
dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the

205
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:11,310
sled dogs that are relayed antitoxins
600 miles over rough ice across

206
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:16,110
treacherous waters through Arctic
blizzards from Nanana to the relief of the

207
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:21,111
stricken gnome in the winter of 1925
endurance fidelity intelligence.

208
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,440
Even though the statue was meant
to commemorate all of the 150 dogs,

209
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,200
it was clear that Balto was
the only one in the limelight.

210
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,080
Then announced Apollo was
still Balto is true owner,

211
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,380
but going to Carson was getting
all of the credit. So Paula,

212
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,950
he was jealous of this because he had
dedicated the majority of his life to

213
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,180
breeding and racing dogs.

214
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,270
He also took the most risk during the
journey by volunteering for the most

215
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,820
dangerous portion of the trail.
By this logic,

216
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,120
he thought that he would have gotten
all of the glory and it was truly a low

217
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:51,180
blow for the least skilled musher
and dogs to get all of the attention.

218
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,871
Not only that,

219
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,020
but he also was angry that bolter who
he considered a subpar dog was now

220
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,150
representing the sub area and Husky breed.

221
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,390
He believed that he and Togo
deserve to be on the front page,

222
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,700
not those damages any he to Nome,

223
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,160
Alaska after a year long American tour
going to cost and found that support a

224
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,770
lot.
It wasn't the only one who was upset.

225
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,010
The community was split between those
who believe to Togo deserved the

226
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,770
recognition and those who supported Balti.

227
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,360
Some even accused costs of skipping the
last stop on purpose because he would

228
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,120
have known this.

229
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
The sled to arrive in town with a
medicine would have gotten all the glory,

230
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,790
but many historians do not believe that
Carson could possibly be motivated by

231
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,350
famed.

232
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,320
He would've had no way of knowing that
the whole country was waiting to hear

233
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,260
news about the small town
in the middle of Alaska.

234
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,920
He was simply too busy and just trying
to stay alive for suppose polar.

235
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,830
The statue of Baltar in central park,
it was the last straw.

236
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,920
He wanted to get rid of ball too and
decided that he needed to go on his own

237
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,190
door with Togo in an attempt to
brand him as the true dog heroin.

238
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,150
He and his manager,

239
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:50,080
they planned a huge spectacle of traveling
to New York City to write his team of

240
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:54,940
dogs down Broadway and end up at Madison
Square Garden, but even on these tours,

241
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,800
children, they were still asking about
Balsa. No matter how hard he tries people,

242
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:02,080
it's still loved the adorable
black Husky with white socks,

243
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,000
that that is musher through a visit.

244
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,790
Since they announced Apollo
was still a Bartos legal owner,

245
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,750
he decided to get rid of him for good by
putting bulto into the rest of the dog

246
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:11,890
team up for auction.

247
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,450
Go to Carson was mortified and he could
not afford to bid on Balto to save him

248
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:19,830
from his fate. When Baltar was
sold, Carson lost his best friends.

249
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,610
He was never the same again.

250
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,490
Balto when the rest of the dog so deem
they were sold to a man named Sam Houston

251
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:34,130
who put them on display.
It is dime museum in Los Angeles.

252
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,220
These were typically filled
with oddities and freed shows.

253
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,820
People paid a dime for a ticket to go
around and stare at the live attractions.

254
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,220
The dogs would change the
wall all day every day.

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,810
They were not allowed to run or to play,

256
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:48,400
and Houston hardly fed them and
they became sick with mange.

257
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,320
In 1927 a man named George
Kimball from Cleveland,

258
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:55,160
Ohio was visiting Los Angeles and he
bought a ticket to the Sam Houston dime

259
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,260
museum.
This is where he found bolted.

260
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,380
Kimble read all the
stories in the newspapers,

261
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,360
so it was horrified to see these
heroic dogs being mistreated.

262
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,020
They asked Sam Houston what it
would take to buy balls, him,

263
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:08,870
and he was told that it would take
$2,000 off to modern day inflation.

264
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,830
That's more like $28,000 George
Campbell could not afford that himself.

265
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,310
So when he returned to Cleveland's,
he began a campaign to save Baltic.

266
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,940
The story of the dog's heroic ms
treatments. It ran in the local newspaper.

267
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,430
Citizens of Cleveland donated
whatever they could afford.

268
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,300
Even young children brought their pennies
to Campbell's campaign hoping to save

269
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:27,680
their heroin.
10 days later,

270
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:31,640
they had raised enough money to buy Balto
and they had a little extra leftover

271
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,400
to save his friends as well.
When the dog's arrived in Cleveland's,

272
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:38,510
they were finally allowed to pull a sled
again as a team and a crowd of 15,000

273
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,500
people lining the street,

274
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,920
sharing and giving the dogs a
standing ovation and the city.

275
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,140
It didn't stop that
citizens of Cleveland's.

276
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,460
They put together the money to build.

277
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:50,330
The dog is a large enclosure at the zoo
with a grassy field for them to run and

278
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,360
play.
The city considered them to be their paps.

279
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,470
They were given more love and
attention than most docs have.

280
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:59,900
A get ballsy remained at the
Cleveland Zoo for the next six years.

281
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,420
When he was between 11 and 14 years old,

282
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,970
he became very sick and
he could barely walk.

283
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,530
When children heard that he was
missing from the grass enclosure,

284
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,970
they would call the zoo every day
asking for updates to see if bolt I was

285
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:12,830
feeling better.
But the veterinarians,

286
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,920
they knew that it was more humane
to put them to sleep. When Balsa,

287
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,470
who died the entire
country Mont it's death,

288
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,780
it was once again on the
front page of every paper.

289
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,900
People loved him so much they
didn't want to let him go. So bold,

290
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:28,100
whose body it was turned into a taxidermy
figure is remains when we've to the

291
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,660
Cleveland Museum of natural history.
Ever since then,

292
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:34,220
children go on school trips to see Balto
and hear the story of the race to save

293
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,280
Noman for all his efforts to
raise [inaudible] from history.

294
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,540
So Paula failed to insert himself in Togo
into the limelight to the extents that

295
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,860
Balto had been that so go farther dozens
of puppies. And when he grew older,

296
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,910
he had a very comfortable doggy retirement
living with a family friend in Poland,

297
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,530
spring, Maine. When he died,

298
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:55,670
his body was also stuffed and mounted
at the Peabody museum of natural history

299
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,470
at Yale University.
However,

300
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,860
it was never preserved properly and
children were touching and petting Togo so

301
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,170
much that the taxi, damn,
you'd figure that came damaged.

302
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,220
He eventually had to be removed from the
museum even after the dogs had passed

303
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:07,521
away.

304
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:10,880
There was still plenty of people in
this lending community who believed that

305
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:13,810
Togo truly deserved the
fame over [inaudible].

306
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,840
But what we do know for sure is that if
it were not for Gunnar Carson's complete

307
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,130
trust and is brave dog,

308
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,830
the entire team would have
frozen to death in that blizzard.

309
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,150
The vaccine for Knome would have been
buried under piles of snow and there is no

310
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,640
telling how many people
would have died as a result.

311
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,060
But what we do know is that
ball to the dog was a hero.

312
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,260
I'm certainly a very
good boy back in Alaska,

313
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,080
going to cost and live to quiet life.
Years later, his niece, Janice Wayland's,

314
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,040
asked her uncle to tell her the story
of what really happens with bolty since

315
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,820
she had had so many different versions
of the story from children at school.

316
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,840
He replied, I will tell you this once
and only once if it wasn't football,

317
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,880
so I wouldn't be alive today.

318
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:56,510
