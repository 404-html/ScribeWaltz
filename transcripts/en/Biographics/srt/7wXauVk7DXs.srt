1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,700
[inaudible] has a military genius,

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:06,050
a tactician without peer at the age
of 35 having just ground himself,

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:07,460
the first emperor of France,

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,400
he said about conquering all of Europe.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,380
His name was Napoleon Bonaparte,

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,410
and above all he was
a master propagandist.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,810
He made use of his
extraordinary way with words,

8
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:20,180
do publish political
manifestos and newspapers,

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,070
and later his autobiography,

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,390
he regularly commissioned portraits and
sculptures and was acutely aware of how

11
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:28,160
to present himself in the best light.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,590
Even when he made moves
to crown himself emperor,

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,380
he used propaganda and political.

14
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:36,020
Now to convince the populace
that it was their idea.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,750
Napoleon has aroused one of two emotions,

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,250
hatred or loyalty.

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,530
Everything around him
seemed bigger than life.

18
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:46,160
Yet he has none of the physical
traits that we associate with power.

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,580
He was short at five foot
two had extremely pale skin,

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,110
small delicate hands,

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,570
and a large head set
on a short stout neck.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,500
Despite this,

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,490
his inner self belief projected the
aura of invincibility that made him a

24
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,660
natural leader of men.

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,480
It led him to the dizzying
heights of Victory Am's,

26
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,910
the crushing despair of to feet.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,190
And this week's biographics.

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,990
We discover the real Napoleon Bonaparte

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,840
in the spring of 1769 the tiny islands
nation of Corsica was under siege,

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,621
a hardy bands.

31
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:34,921
Of course,

32
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:35,101
it can.

33
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:39,720
Patriots determines to repel the French
army that had invaded their lambs.

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,410
They never stood a chance that after
a year of fighting death and carnage,

35
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:44,730
the rebels were a fetus.

36
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,730
The survivors trudge through the
mountains back to their homes.

37
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,520
Among them was that easier
and Carlo Bonaparte?

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,091
Let's easier.

39
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,410
It was six months pregnant.

40
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,180
It was the day of the Feast of assumption.

41
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,560
On August,

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
1517 69 went letizia.

43
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:01,110
It gave birth to her second child
and he was named Napoleon Napoleon.

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,820
His father gave up the flag.

45
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,050
Of course it can independence.

46
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,530
Once French victory was a shirt he refused
to fight on in the mountains with his

47
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:08,910
former Patriot holdouts,

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,660
the 23 year old university student
and ingratiated himself to the French

49
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,900
overlords and quickly took on the
trappings of French privileged.

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,500
It was something that his second son
would never forgive him for viewing his

51
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,440
father as a traitor who had
betrayed his countryman.

52
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,720
Collar then entered upon a law practice.

53
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:27,270
Before long he had won election
to the course of an assembly.

54
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,160
He became accepted among the elite.

55
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:29,521
Of course,

56
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,850
it can society and was viewed
with favor by the French rulers.

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,240
Yes.

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,890
The more successful he became,

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,100
the more it drove a wedge
between him and his second son.

60
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,960
In contrast to how he viewed his father,

61
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:40,920
the younger Polian Sims,

62
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,880
he adored his mother.

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,550
There's easier,

64
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,480
was a strong willed on the
woman of her 13 pregnancies.

65
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,860
She ended up with eight children.

66
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,270
Oh half disciplinarian.

67
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,980
She would tolerate no nonsense.

68
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,880
We have Napoleon would lead to reminisce
that all of his success in life was due

69
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:56,640
to the training of that he had
received at his mother's knee,

70
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,090
the and set foot on the French mainland
for the first time in the winter of 1778

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,080
his father having security in that
position at the prestigious Royal Military

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,030
College at Brienne in northern France.

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,160
Napoleon though he hated us,

74
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,320
accustomed to the warmth
of the Mediterranean,

75
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,280
the harsh climate,

76
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,510
shift him to the bone,

77
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,360
just top it off.

78
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,430
The skinny uncoordinated country
by could hardly speak any French,

79
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,700
any one of the facts that
he was a scholarship by
into country bumpkin and the

80
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,700
loyal Corsican with a strange accident
would have been enough to make the

81
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:39,260
bullies targets and yet somehow Napoleon
accustomed himself to life at Brienne.

82
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,890
His stubbornness and tough exterior
made him immune to the taunts of is more

83
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:43,431
privileged.

84
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,870
Classmates seem they,

85
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,770
along with his teachers,

86
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,180
lost interest in the Sullen,

87
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,530
always serious Bonaparte.

88
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,550
Napoleon,

89
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,450
he became a loner at the
age of 16 Napoleon began his
military apprenticeship as

90
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:56,870
a second left tenants training with
the country's most elite itinerary.

91
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,590
Eunice.

92
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,790
He knows his trade well and developed
into a skilled handler of arms as well as

93
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,230
a capable Hendra of men.

94
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,740
Yes,

95
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,490
the advancements that he had mapped
out for himself was slow in coming.

96
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,250
He soon realized that
hard work and application,

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,690
we're not enough to forge a stellar
military career position and money.

98
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,260
They also played their part and
he had neither by his late teens.

99
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,140
Napoleon found himself in a
state of frustrated inertia.

100
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,180
He knew that he was
destined for great things,

101
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,010
yet nothing was happening for him.

102
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,200
Simply he was bored to death.

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,700
What Napoleon needed was a cataclysmic
event that would up ends the existing

104
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:35,630
order in presenting with the opportunity
to grab hold of and shape the future.

105
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,440
Little did he know though that this
was waiting just around the corner.

106
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,830
On July the 14th 1789 Paris
erupted and revolution the spark.

107
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,640
There's unleashed the revolution
in all its Furio card.

108
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,600
When a crowd's took over,

109
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,810
an armory called hotel to invalid,

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,570
they grabbed its weapons and stormed the
Bastille prison in search of powder and

111
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,270
shot word spreads of
the crown success ends.

112
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,980
Uprisings began all over France,

113
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,510
grand juries and manor houses.

114
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,373
They were overrun.

115
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,600
The country was in great turmoil.

116
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,740
20 year old Napoleon was far from Paris
when revolution break forth cause they

117
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,240
not to revolutionary himself.

118
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,960
He welcomes the revolts which was shaking
the system of privileges which he so

119
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:22,794
despised.

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,221
After all,

121
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,160
it was this very system that prevented
him from achieving the advancement of

122
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,570
rank that he felt was due to him.

123
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,030
When the French republic was declared
in the fall of 1792 v ambitious courses

124
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,460
can,

125
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,250
he wanted to play a
pass formulating a plan.

126
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,980
He took a leave of absence from
the army and returned to Corsica,

127
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,570
which was now a part of France.

128
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,530
He was intent on entering local politics
and rising through the ranks until he

129
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,990
could assert its influence
on the national stage.

130
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,750
The course it can.

131
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,250
Governor,

132
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,730
however,

133
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,730
Rebuff Napoleon calling him
a big inexperienced boy and
Napoleon reacted to this

134
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:55,470
by setting up a power base
to oppose the governor.

135
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,950
He attracted a following of young cronies.

136
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,560
That's the establishment's
proved too strong fan.

137
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,720
Napoleon was forced to
flee to the mountains.

138
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,291
He ends.

139
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:08,120
His entire family were labeled traitors
and enemies of the father lands setting

140
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,751
south France.

141
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,180
In June of 1793 Napoleon was tougher,

142
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,230
more steely-eyed and more hard skinned
as a result of his unhappy experience in

143
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,090
Corsica.

144
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,850
The experience also caused
a mental displacement.

145
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,960
No longer a Corsican.

146
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,530
Well,

147
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,840
he was now 30 French that France.

148
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,410
However,

149
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,440
while that was going to have to be
molded to make it worthy of feminine,

150
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,920
if I didn't return to the
army as an artillery caps him,

151
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,150
he was quickly ordered too,

152
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:42,661
too long.

153
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:46,020
A city of 28,000 which had
broken into open rebellion.

154
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,750
This is dozens of this southern port.

155
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,810
It thrown their port,

156
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,980
open it to the British.

157
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,550
It was the French itineraries
job to prevent the British
from gaining a foothold

158
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,380
and just to subjugate the rebels.

159
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,890
The role of the ones that the British
were defending the city from their ships,

160
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:00,160
cannons Napoleon,

161
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,180
and knew that he had been presented with
the opportunity that could transform

162
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,014
his destiny.

163
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,160
Aristocratic officers had fled France
leaving a vacuum that the Polian was all

164
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,090
too eager to fill.

165
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,630
All the had to do was simply
proven itself on his commands.

166
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:16,110
Guns and suppliers were rushed in from
Provence and there's gunners were taught

167
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:16,890
to Mandan.

168
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,460
The regular infantry were intensely
retrains unto Bonaparte's direct

169
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:21,240
supervision.

170
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,730
He also began to display
the flashes of charisma,

171
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,180
which would forge an unbreakable
loyalty within his ranks.

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,850
On December the 17th he personally
led the assault of Fort Egg.

173
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,140
Relate his bravery and his
cunning immediately apparent,

174
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,310
throwing himself into the fray.

175
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,900
He fought with fury.

176
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,980
Unlike most commanders,

177
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:39,180
Napoleon led from the front.

178
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh,

179
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,540
horse was shot out from under him and
it's an enemy ban at slashed him in the

180
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,040
fight.

181
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,410
Yes,

182
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,220
he continued to attack and his forces
quickly overcame the resistance.

183
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,911
Within hours,

184
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:51,270
10 British ships had been destroyed and
those that remained were in retreat.

185
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,283
The local people,

186
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,460
they would then subjugate us.

187
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,360
It was a stunning victory for Napoleon
and one that led to his promotion to

188
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,230
Brigadier General.

189
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,550
In the spring of 1795 Napoleon visited
Paris has ambition burning brighter than

190
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,090
ever.

191
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,810
While there he was charged with
subjugating the parisien mobs by any means

192
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:07,500
necessary.

193
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,310
He jumped at the opportunity grabbing
cannons and muskets in order to equip is

194
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:12,390
poorly armed forces.

195
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,020
He said his guns up inside the tutor
Rian positions that made it impregnable.

196
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,950
When the attack came,

197
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,030
Napoleon commanded his men to unleash
a merciless hail of fire upon them.

198
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,460
Waiting until he could see
the whites of their eyes.

199
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,240
He sends a barrage of great shots
that decimated the Parisien mob.

200
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,380
The enemy attacks us.

201
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,670
We killed a great many of them.

202
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,251
Now we'll,

203
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,080
there's quiet.

204
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,130
I could not be happier.

205
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,570
The podium wrote to his brother,

206
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,520
Napoleon was triumphant.

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,690
Within a month,

208
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:39,600
he had been made a full
general I just 26 years of age.

209
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,990
He was the commander of
the army of the interior.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,833
Okay.

211
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,400
As a reward for his success against the
Parisien mobs was given command of the

212
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,480
French army in Italy.

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,560
There he was charged
with defeating France,

214
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:00,360
his enemies,

215
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
the Austrians,

216
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,770
along with that Italian allies
to push them back over the Alps.

217
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,710
This was his first opportunity
to fight on foreign soil,

218
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,110
and Napoleon was determined
to capitalize on this.

219
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,160
Prior to his arrival,

220
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,150
Napoleon's generals had already written
him off as a new accounts upstart with

221
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,140
illusions of grand.

222
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,330
Yet when Bonaparte's
arrived in the flashes,

223
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,220
generals quickly realized their mistake.

224
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,380
They had vastly underestimated.

225
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:23,214
Then you Camada.

226
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,690
He quickly put them in that place.

227
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,100
For nearly two years,

228
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,220
there in competence had seen the French
forces stagnating in the Alps with

229
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,210
nothing to show for it,

230
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,800
but a general sense of apathy and
discontent as the generals bit their lips.

231
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,510
Napoleon addressed the troops.

232
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,351
Soldiers,

233
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,730
you are naked and deal fed.

234
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,380
No fame shines upon you.

235
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,710
I will lead you into the most
fertile plains in the world.

236
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,070
Rich provinces and great city
as well lie in your power.

237
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,660
You will find their honor,

238
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,220
glory and riches.

239
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,420
The men were enraptured by their new
leader smiling and laughing in the midst.

240
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,850
It was unlike anything
I had ever seen before.

241
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,530
He picks up their spirits and made them
believe in themselves and infusing them

242
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,071
with passion.

243
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:05,070
He began molding them into
eight formidable fighting force.

244
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:05,881
Meanwhile,

245
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:09,090
the other European powers had become
very nervous about what was going on in

246
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:09,750
France.

247
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,480
The execution of their king and queen
led to the fears that the French

248
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,500
experiments in democracy would spreads
am's threat and their own kingdoms.

249
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,500
This led them to quickly move
against the new French government.

250
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,520
This led to a series of wars between
France and most of the major European

251
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,260
powers,

252
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,560
the of built his army into the most
efficient conquering force on the European

253
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,370
mainland.

254
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,780
Over the next three years.

255
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,220
He brought stunning victories,

256
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,210
not only in Italy,

257
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,390
but as far as Australia
and parts of North Africa.

258
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,270
There's a north African invasion force
was actually moving it's Britain,

259
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,700
which used Egypt as a trading route,

260
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,400
though he failed to bring
Egypt under control,

261
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,600
Napoleon was greeted as a hero on,

262
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,420
it's returned to Paris in 1799
yet he founds a nation in Tamale.

263
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,710
The governments had no money.

264
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:56,310
The Austrians and the Russians were
threatening to invade and some people even

265
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,110
wanted to bring back the royal family.

266
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,800
Rumors were flying of a cube with
the people on the army behind him.

267
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,370
Napoleon at took charge of the grand
assembly installing a new government that

268
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,950
was to be headed by three
provisional consults,

269
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,190
one of these three men with
Napoleon Bonaparte himself,

270
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,580
and it was he who everyone knew
was going to wield the power.

271
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,390
Immediately.

272
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,470
Napoleon took control.

273
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:20,010
He sidelined the other two consoles
personally rewriting the constitution to

274
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,480
make himself the first consult.

275
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,050
At 30 years of age,

276
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,240
Napoleon Bonaparte had risen from his
humble Corsican backgrounds to become the

277
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,140
most powerful

278
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,600
man in France

279
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,240
as the absolute central power in France.

280
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,810
Napoleon had inherited a nation that
had limped from one failed attempt to to

281
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:47,670
replace the rule of monarchy to another.

282
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,420
For many people,

283
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,840
the conditions they found themselves
in at the dawn of the 19th century were

284
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,560
worse than before the revolution.

285
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,890
They looked in Napoleon to
save them from their dispatch.

286
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
First though he had to save
them from the Austrians.

287
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,340
The Austrians had regrouped and gains
back and most of the lands that Napoleon

288
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,650
had secured during the Italian campaign,

289
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,970
the arch Duke Francis.

290
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:11,500
The second was intent on crushing the
course that can use he thought he could do

291
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,334
as he pleased,

292
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,241
as was his custom.

293
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:18,241
Napoleon decided to take the offensive
in the spring of 1800 he took his 40,000

294
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,410
strong army across the French Alps.

295
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,820
It was a harrowing track,

296
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:25,540
has men dragging field artillery and
provisions up steep snow covered mountain

297
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,110
rangers,

298
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,410
which towers to a height of 10,500 feet.

299
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,200
Men Donnie's on reason and there's the
grand army stumbled through this and

300
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,034
Bernard Pass.

301
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,920
They were in a state of utter exhaustion,

302
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,490
but the crossing it had
made in just six days.

303
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,760
The battle was joined on June
the 14th and at the day's end,

304
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,100
7,000 Frenchmen lay debt.

305
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,600
The Austrians who would finally retreat
in from the field of battle left 14,000

306
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,090
bodies behind the
totally spans grand army.

307
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,133
They had one again.

308
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,190
The Austrians withdrew and early the
next year signed a peace treaty with

309
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,890
Napoleon.

310
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,130
Great Britain was the only country
remaining in the podiums weight.

311
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,910
He was simply the supreme ruler
of the land mass that was Europe.

312
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,480
However,

313
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,340
Great Britain has unquestioned command
of the seas and fabulously Richard.

314
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,950
This point due to how colonial conquest
since boasting the greatest navy in the

315
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:16,060
wells Briston decided it was time to
holds the rise of the little general

316
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,290
president declared war on France on May
the 18th 1803 and it was at this point

317
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,510
in the Napoleon decided it
was time to invade England,

318
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,750
displaying the laser like
focus that epitomize the man.

319
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,470
He stated,

320
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,660
all my thoughts aren't
directed towards England's.

321
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,880
I want only for a favorable winds.

322
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,460
Two plants,

323
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,940
the Imperial Eagle on the Tower of London.

324
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,961
As it turns out though,

325
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:39,430
the French invasion of Great Britain
never materialized by September,

326
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,210
1805 war with Austria.

327
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,970
Now fortified by the Russians
was once again a priority.

328
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,370
If the ground's army was
being rushed from the coast,

329
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,500
do the heart of the Austrian empire.

330
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,690
Then on October the 21st the Royal Navy,

331
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:53,500
it smashed the combined Spanish British
fleet in the battle of Trafalgar,

332
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,170
leaving the French
essentially without a navy.

333
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,000
The British that left them safe.

334
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,500
The now on December,

335
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:02,770
the second day's here for Napoleon had
crowned himself as the first emperor of

336
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:06,400
the French in a lavish ceremony
in all but name and place.

337
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,950
It was just lengthy
coronation of the old kings,

338
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,840
which with one telling difference,

339
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,730
Napoleon that you
controller of his own fates,

340
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,660
place the crown,

341
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,800
all 80 jewel encrusted pounds
of it upon his own head.

342
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,973
Okay.

343
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,140
On December the second day,

344
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,351
you know,

345
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,470
five Napoleon found himself again
poised for Massell against Austria.

346
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,100
This time,

347
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,390
four to five by Russia,

348
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,550
this would prove to be the little general,

349
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,540
his greatest victory.

350
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,230
He deliberately abandoned a strategic
position near the town of Wooster in the

351
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,064
Austrian empire.

352
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,090
So that his army,

353
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,060
which numbered around 68,000
would appear vulnerable.

354
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,700
He then weakened his right flank,

355
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:51,970
so it was to look the 90,000 strong flow
into a trap if they their center open

356
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,980
to counter attack and the pony and cut
the line in two by 4:30 PM the allies

357
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,210
were either dead or foreign retreat.

358
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,520
The battlefields have
simply fallen silent.

359
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,070
The Battle of Austerlitz just like that
was over what it began as a great allied

360
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,850
opportunity to finally defeat and destroy.

361
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:11,030
Napoleon Bonaparte had ended
not only in their defeat,

362
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,500
but in catastrophe.

363
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,370
The grounds victory at [inaudible] was
followed up with a 21 day subjugation of

364
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,090
pressure.

365
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,170
Over the next five years.

366
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,720
Victory followed victory as one by one.

367
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:25,190
The European powers bowed to the
dictates of Emperor Napoleon only at one

368
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,070
European nation remains
to be brought to heel.

369
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,293
Russia

370
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,850
[inaudible] is a colossal army across the
Newman River run June the 24th 1812 to

371
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,870
intimidate Russia,

372
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,540
but it turns out to be
the undoing of his empire.

373
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,570
The Russians systematically
retreated and scorched the earth,

374
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,910
which drags the French
deep into their territory.

375
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,380
Then when they did do battle,

376
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,960
it was the bloodiest
day of Napoleon's Korea.

377
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,160
The French entered Moscow.

378
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,060
A week later,

379
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,530
I need to find it evacuated.

380
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,080
The retreat ended up
being even more costly.

381
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,170
Soldiers had insufficient clothing for
the freezing temperatures of an early

382
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,160
Windsor disease,

383
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,850
devastated the ranks and Russian
forces pursued them all the way.

384
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,030
A little over a six of the 600,000
men who marched into Russia came home.

385
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,510
This was a blow from which the little
general would never recover by now for the

386
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:21,350
political map of Europe,

387
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:22,250
it had changed the British,

388
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,731
the Spanish,

389
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,800
the Portuguese pushed the French
Bac over the Pyrenees in dependency,

390
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,710
love walk.

391
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,410
A grand coalition was formed with the
decisive victory coming at the battle of

392
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:35,390
Leipzig in October of 1813 known as the
battle of the nations that left 38,000

393
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:38,540
French dead or wounded
and 20 thousands captured.

394
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,963
Yeah.

395
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,350
Napoleon escapes only defines
open hostility back in Paris.

396
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,580
The legislative assembly,

397
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:54,061
the centers,

398
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:55,770
and even his own general stands on him.

399
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,840
He has no choice but to advocate,

400
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,441
which he did.

401
00:16:58,441 --> 00:17:02,220
So in April of [inaudible] 1814 it was
agreed that Napoleon would be sent into

402
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,740
exile on the Mediterranean island of Elba.

403
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,950
After 10 months of exome,

404
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,050
the Polian had had enough somehow on the
night of February the 26th 1850 and he

405
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:13,710
managed to sneak past his gods and set
sail in a small boat for the mother

406
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:16,860
country within a handful
of loyal soldiers.

407
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,760
Miraculously,

408
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,800
they managed to avoid
the British warships,

409
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,630
stepping foot back on French soil.

410
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,470
He fixed his sights on Paris and it's
taking back what had been torn from

411
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:25,960
heaven.

412
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,880
After six days in just few men were halted
by an infantry regiments with strict

413
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:30,960
orders to detain him,

414
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,260
the podium straight ahead of his
followers and stood in their midst.

415
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,730
Soldiers either clouds if there is one
among you who wants to kill his general

416
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:39,600
and emperor.

417
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,643
Here I am.

418
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,000
His charisma that's done it again rather
than rush to taken captive the massed

419
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,100
infantry broken to wild applause.

420
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,540
Cheers of long live.

421
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,940
The emperor filled the air.

422
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,660
Suddenly he had an army.

423
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,580
As he closed it on Paris,

424
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,090
he drew more and more
support in one place.

425
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:59,370
Softer and other treats defected from
the royal army and joined the rebel army,

426
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,470
the writing that it was on the wall.

427
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,820
By the time you arrived in Paris,

428
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,050
let me the 18th and flat.

429
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,700
The podium was back in command.

430
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,420
The people,

431
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
they welcomed him as a redeemed here,

432
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,283
right

433
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,840
across Europe.

434
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,790
The allies were in shock and disbelief.

435
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,630
The devil,

436
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,860
it had been unchanged.

437
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,410
They would have to unite
one more time to stop him.

438
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,483
This time though,

439
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,450
they would have to totally destroy the
man so that there was no chance he would

440
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:32,170
come back.

441
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,070
Napoleon was declared an outlaw and a
disturber of the tranquility of the wells.

442
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,200
They mask their armies for attack.

443
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,990
The great reckoning it was that happens,

444
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,420
it would be delivered on a field of
Rye and clover just outside of a small

445
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,220
Belgian town called Waterloo.

446
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,490
On June the 18th 72,000 French soldiers
face day 68,000 strong allied force

447
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:52,120
under the Duke of Wellington.

448
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,590
While the fighting seemed even Napoleon
made many tactical errors including

449
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,690
launching his imperial guard too late.

450
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,500
Here's the most fatal error was to wait
until midday before ordering his initial

451
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,010
attack.

452
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,960
In order to the last of
the muddy ground dry.

453
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,300
This gave the Prussians
time do enter the fray.

454
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:07,960
Later on,

455
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,290
they smash it against his right
flank and the battle was lost.

456
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,280
Four days later,

457
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,780
Napoleon abdicated again,

458
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,760
but this time it would be no return.

459
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,770
He was packed off to the remote British
colony of Santa Elena at 46 Napoleon was

460
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,270
simply a man without a future,

461
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,280
the man of unstoppable ambition,

462
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,210
the man of action,

463
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,440
the amount of headlines he was confined
to reading the newspaper and gardening.

464
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,180
He died on May the fifth 1821 most likely
from stomach cancer days before when

465
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,200
he knew his time was up,

466
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,490
he had whispered to to one of his gods
to die is nothing but to live defeated

467
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
and without glory is to die every day.

468
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,760
