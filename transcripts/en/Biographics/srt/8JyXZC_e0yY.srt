1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,170
The world outside of central Maine always
never got to know Stephen King for his

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,150
wife's diligence.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,510
Indeck confidence in her husband's the
book that launched a million pages might

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,930
never have come into being when his
wife Tabitha rescued the start of the

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,520
manuscripts of Carrie from the trash
and insisted her husband finished.

6
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:19,920
His king was working as an English
teacher and writing on the site.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,140
Some of those judgements
was absolutely right.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,760
Carrie was a smash hit and Stephen King
is now one of the world's most famous

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,990
and prolific authors.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,840
So what's the story behind the stories?

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,380
Well,

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,820
that still even into his life,

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,370
Stephen King was born in Portland,

14
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:50,730
Maine,

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,660
the largest city of the mostly rural
state that serves as the setting for so

16
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,070
many of his famous stories.

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,790
Steven was the second
son born to Nellie ends,

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,580
Donald King,

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,810
but the family of four seam became a
family of three when steven was only two

20
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,980
years old and his brother only for that
father went out telling the family he

21
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:10,650
was buying a pack of cigarettes
and he never returned.

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,610
King's mother worked several jobs moving
with the boys from Maine and going from

23
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:18,000
state to state to falling into work and
the place that she could afford to live

24
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,320
and raise our two boys,

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,370
but Maine,

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,880
it was home and it's where the
family eventually settled for good.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,260
When the family moved back to Maine,

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,820
they didn't have indoor plumbing,

29
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,580
and this was the 19 sixties
king's life growing up.

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,790
It was a far cry from the wealth
that he has now with King.

31
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,510
Didn't see his childhood as exceptional
or out of the ordinary that he does

32
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,110
acknowledge.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,000
He's always liked scary things.

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,020
My childhood was pretty ordinary.

35
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:41,141
Yeah,

36
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,810
except from a very early age.

37
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,950
I wanted to be scattered.

38
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,963
I just did.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,920
I was scared afterwards.

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,030
I wanted to light on because I was scared.

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,400
There was something in the closet.

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,390
My imagination was very active.

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,830
Even at a young age.

44
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,000
Some have said that king might also be
inspired to write such horrifying stories

45
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,290
by a childhood events.

46
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,700
He doesn't even remember.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,770
According to mum,

48
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,490
I had gone off to play
at a neighbor's house,

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,290
a house that was near a railroad line.

50
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,750
About an hour after I left,

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,420
I came back,

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,981
she says,

53
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,040
is white as a ghost.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,140
I would not speak for the rest of the day.

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,920
I would not tell her why I'm not waiting
to be picked up or phones that I wanted

56
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:14,754
to come home.

57
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,290
I would not tell her why chums,

58
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,760
mum hadn't walked me back,

59
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,290
but it allowed me to come alone.

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,680
It turns out that the kid
I had been playing with had
been run over by a freight

61
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,020
train while playing on
or crossing the tracks.

62
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,800
Years later,

63
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,130
my mother told me they'd picked
up the pieces in a wicker basket.

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,040
As True Isaac is that events Mr Bennett
was not the only explanation for kings,

65
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,420
that vivid imagination of friends of
the king's tell stories about how the

66
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:39,090
family was well known for
their attention to literature.

67
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,540
If their mother couldn't find or afford
a babysitter should leave her son's

68
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,270
alone with the expectation they
would read aloud to each other.

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,560
Kings and love of stories and the written
word was fostered from an early age

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,580
and that tradition,

71
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,270
it stuck.

72
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,840
Gang and his wife Tabitha also made their
own children read aloud to each other

73
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,320
and to them he'd even record them on
cassettes to make the family that own of

74
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,670
audio books growing up.

75
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,510
King also write material for his
brother's newsletter called Dave's rag.

76
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,990
They made copies on a mimeograph machine
and distributed it to their friends,

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,050
but king was unable to move me on just
writing for his siblings and he was the

78
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,630
last up in 1965 when he
was still in high school.

79
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,250
King was published in comics.

80
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:19,060
Review the story was right in line with
the frightening plots that we all know

81
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:20,340
king for today can.

82
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:23,350
You had been working as a grave
digger and money as a teenager.

83
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,670
The job inspired him to write a story
called I was a teenage grave robbing and

84
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,820
its publication was his first
taste of published success.

85
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,780
The only downside was that he didn't
get paid for the work is first paid.

86
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:39,340
Publication didn't come until he was
in college and he earns $35 for a story

87
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,780
called the glass floor.

88
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,240
Congratulated from
Lisbon falls high school.

89
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,300
The high school in the town that later
became the setting for portions of the

90
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:46,481
book,

91
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:46,750
11,

92
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,830
2163.

93
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,150
Lisbon falls was a mill town and King
spent time working in the towns mill when

94
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,050
he was a teenager

95
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,550
after graduation.

96
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,590
King had aspirations to be a writeup,

97
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,700
so we headed north to the University of
men or no to earn a degree in English

98
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,450
literature.

99
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,231
While in college,

100
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,200
King was a columnist
for the college paper,

101
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,810
was outspoken against the Vietnam War
and worked in the college library.

102
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,200
That's the library is now
home to many of kings papers.

103
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,940
It's also where he met his wife,

104
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,780
Tabitha was looking for a book in the
stacks and king passed by and struck up a

105
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:30,790
conversation with her and four years
later the literary recouple had graduated,

106
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,753
had a daughter,

107
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,690
and they were married.

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
Woking had been rising in college.

109
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,030
He was far from being able to support
himself and the growing family just by

110
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:38,600
writing.

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,410
He Tabitha and their daughter Naomi web
living in a trailer outside of Bangor

112
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,360
and king was working two jobs.

113
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,530
He was teaching English at Hampton Academy
and in the summers was pumping gas at

114
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,530
the local station while also
working shifts at a laundromat.

115
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,100
Tabitha took shifts at a Dunkin
donuts and they struggled to get by,

116
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,650
but it can always made time to write.

117
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,960
Even in the cramped quarters
of the family's trailer,

118
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,040
he made a point to set aside space
for a writing desk and the typewriter,

119
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,510
2000 words a day was his goal and
that's the goal that he stands by today.

120
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,020
Eventually king earned two
teaching certificates and
was able to put his college

121
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,750
education to use as a
teacher at Hampton Academy.

122
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,660
The work still wasn't what
he wanted to be doing,

123
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,110
vote.

124
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,900
It was writing that he loved and writing,

125
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,823
but he wanted to honor.

126
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,940
Living from writing simply has always
been his purpose in life as he explains.

127
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,210
There was nothing else I was made to
do that was made to write stories and I

128
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:30,320
love to write stories.

129
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,580
That's why I do it.

130
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,180
I really can't imagine doing
anything else and it's like cons.

131
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,640
Imagine and not doing what I do
though it took years of effort.

132
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,310
His big break did come
off the top of a fish,

133
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,990
the beginning of carry out of the trash.

134
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:45,890
In 1973 king finish the book
and sent it off to a publisher.

135
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,950
He wasn't confident about its
chances of being published,

136
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,730
saying,

137
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,950
my considered opinion
was the diet written,

138
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,960
the world's all time loser.

139
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,860
The family wasn't doing well financially
when he sent Carrie and then as they

140
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,240
couldn't even afford a phone,

141
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,160
so he got the news via telegram.

142
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,340
He'd be receiving a $2,500 advance and
double date would be publishing carry.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,510
Then even better news came.

144
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,260
The paperback rights were sold
for $400,000 and without Kinkade,

145
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,510
quit teaching and begin writing full
time and his family would be better off

146
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,250
than they ever debt to.

147
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,390
Imagine the book.

148
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,080
It was an absolute smash hits.

149
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,270
Within the next year,

150
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,780
a million copies were sold and only
three years later it was made into an

151
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,340
academy award winning movie.

152
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,020
Stephen King was now officially a
writer and an American celebrity,

153
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,580
but success did not mean the king settled
into a completely untroubled life.

154
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,510
As he got to writing,

155
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,940
cranking out books like
misery and pet cemetery,

156
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,150
he was drinking heavily and so he.

157
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,013
We had a problem.

158
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,680
Can they told rolling stone?

159
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,090
Nobody in the house drank,

160
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:47,720
but me,

161
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,260
my wife would have a glass of wine and
that was all so I went into the garage

162
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,710
one night and the trashcan that was set
aside for beer cans was full to the top.

163
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,660
It had been empty the week before.

164
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,450
I was drinking like a case of
beer a night and I thought,

165
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,680
I'm an alcoholic.

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,300
That was probably 78,

167
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,080
79.

168
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,710
I thought,

169
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,950
I've got to be really careful because if
somebody says you're drinking too much,

170
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,873
you have to quit.

171
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,020
I won't be able to.

172
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,100
He knew he had a problem,

173
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,180
but he didn't stop drinking.

174
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,780
In fact,

175
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,920
you took it one step further.

176
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,060
In the late seventies,

177
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,450
king started doing cocaine using
this at night while he was writing.

178
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,500
By this time,

179
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,200
he and Tabitha had three kids
and he knew his addictions.

180
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,170
We're taking a toll both on
his family and on his writing.

181
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,860
He attributes the length of Tommy
knockers to cocaine and looking back,

182
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,950
I said the book could have been half
the length if so much of it had to been

183
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,260
inspired purely by his drugged up energy,

184
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,070
and he has also said that he doesn't
even remember writing cue job so bad was

185
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,620
his consumption of alcohol
and drugs during the eighties.

186
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,660
He says there's one novel Qj
that I barely remember writing.

187
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:45,350
It's all I don't say
that with pride or shame.

188
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,750
I knew with a vague sense of sorrow loss.

189
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,770
I liked that book.

190
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,990
I wish I could remember
enjoying the good parts.

191
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,200
I put them down on the page
in the shining and misery,

192
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,960
both carrie and undercurrent of
his reference to his struggles.

193
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,410
Jack's Ahrens is an alcoholic and the
shining and king has described the

194
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:04,130
antagonist of misery as essentially
the personification of cocaine.

195
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,760
It wasn't until the late eighties when
Tabitha threatened to leave him and the

196
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,850
family stage two dramatic
intervention that king things off.

197
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,320
His acts of the intervention has
family displayed drug paraphernalia,

198
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,720
orange pills that they had collected
from the trash gang with the magnitude of

199
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,720
his problem laid out in front of his
eyes and in front of his family and

200
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:21,290
friends,

201
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,970
made the decision to get sober.

202
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,740
Now he's been sober for
nearly three decades during
the 19 nineties and into the

203
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,880
21st century,

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,780
can continue to be one of the world's
most prolific and the well known writers

205
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,651
is book spoons,

206
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,970
movies and miniseries,

207
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,360
and over 350 million copies
of his books have been sold.

208
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
After it became so popular,

209
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,810
King took the step of
publishing under a pseudonym,

210
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,710
Richard Bachman.

211
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,920
He wanted to see if he could still get
books published and towns for themselves

212
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,680
without his now famous names
splashed across the front.

213
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,880
It turns out well,

214
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,780
he totally could.

215
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,590
The first book he published under the
name Richard Bachman was rage set in

216
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:54,930
gangs,

217
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,580
familiar weld of main high school.

218
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,720
The book tells the story.

219
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,810
You have a teenager who engages
in violent acts at his school.

220
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,100
He sets his locker on fire.

221
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,641
She says,

222
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,610
Algebra teacher and the tax and
other students with a wrench.

223
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,840
In 1977,

224
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,700
it was a figment of kings imagination,

225
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,800
but in the late eighties
and nineties and nineties,

226
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,450
the book unfortunately started to resemble
actual occurrences at schools across

227
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:16,530
the United States.

228
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,760
In 1997,

229
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:18,840
after a student's shot,

230
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,940
eight people at a prayer
meeting in Kentucky,

231
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,810
it was discovered that he had a copy of
rage and his locker disturbed by this

232
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,240
king lost his publisher to
take the book out of Prince.

233
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,050
To this day,

234
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,790
rage remains out of friends

235
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,710
even as his success group
king remain living in Maine.

236
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,680
The family owns a home in Bangor
on a human level near the lakes.

237
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,430
For the summit,

238
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,850
it was near the home in level
that king's life almost ended.

239
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,350
In 1999,

240
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,920
king was taking a walk along one of the
winding would it roads that aren't so

241
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:56,370
familiar,

242
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,630
part of means landscape.

243
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,040
Then events smashed into him from behind
was knocks off the roads and into a

244
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:02,660
ditch.

245
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,910
Witnesses said he was in a heap and
it was clear his leg was broken.

246
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,640
His glasses flew off and landed in
the van that hit him at the hospital.

247
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,140
We went to multiple surgeries and had
to do physical therapy as a part of his

248
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:13,974
recovery.

249
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,670
Brian Smith,

250
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,750
the driver who hits King,

251
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,090
had a track record of driving infractions,

252
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,260
including a Dui.

253
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,290
The king accident was blamed on
Smith as dog distracting him,

254
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,240
causing him to swerve into the author.

255
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,290
Smith received a six month jail sentence
that was later suspended and had his

256
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,820
license revoked for a year.

257
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
King was pretty upset at this.

258
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:35,550
He wanted Smith's license revoked for
life given his history of bad driving.

259
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
Only a year after the accident,

260
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,900
Smith was found dead in his
trailer at the age of 43.

261
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,620
He died of a painkiller overdose and then
the twist of fate that seems straight

262
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,454
out of a king novel.

263
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,200
He died on king's birthday.

264
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,430
September 21st kings sustained
horrific injuries in the accident,

265
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,880
but resumed writing one a month after
being released from the hospital.

266
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,120
He finished the highly regarded
on writing and didn't do thousand.

267
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,610
The book was published like 2002.

268
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,210
King decided that he simply didn't have
the strength to keep writing as he had

269
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:06,750
in the past where you had previously
sat and typed for hours at a time,

270
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,970
it now person to sit for long periods.

271
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,790
Addiction had also become
part of his life again.

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,900
After the accident,

273
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:13,431
he took oxygen,

274
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,510
comes in to deal with the
pain from his injuries,

275
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,660
and he became addicted to it
as he had a decade earlier.

276
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,020
It was able to overcome the addiction
and to live life once again,

277
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:22,640
so belief,

278
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,270
but I think in lieu of the written word,

279
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,780
there's ultimately proved to be strong
for his post accident injuries and

280
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,540
struggles and so king
returns to his craft.

281
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,320
He has said this,

282
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,250
he literally needs to write in order to
live and what would happen if you didn't

283
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:35,820
write?

284
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,100
Oh,

285
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,933
I'd be debt.

286
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,590
I would have drank myself to death old
drug myself to death or committed suicide

287
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:41,940
or some goddamn thing.

288
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,720
Well,

289
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,170
since this accident he's published
dozens of stories and books including Mr.

290
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,730
Mercedes do Mckee Eleven,

291
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:51,540
2163 and under the dome
a die hard red sox fan.

292
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,830
Like so many of his New England,

293
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,831
Stephen King,

294
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,900
also Carrie wrote a
book after the Red Sox,

295
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:59,290
2004 world series win
faithful to die hard.

296
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,820
Boston red sox fans chronic the historic
2004 season shared the story of the

297
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:07,930
emotional roller coaster king and so many
other red sox fans road throughout the

298
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:12,610
summer and fall of 2004 and a feather
display of his eclectic interests and

299
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:14,920
abilities can dabbles in music he played,

300
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:16,150
gets off the rock bottom,

301
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:20,500
remainders of and he was other members
you might recognize to you anytime Dave

302
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,580
Berry and migrating a few of the other
celebrities who joined king on stage.

303
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,270
Even actually Carrie wrote a musical
with John Mellencamp build as a southern

304
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:32,620
gothic supernatural musical ghost brothers
of [inaudible] county opens and ran

305
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,990
for a month at the alliance
theatre in Atlanta.

306
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,850
Can is now 70 years old,

307
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,260
but he hasn't run out of ideas.

308
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,950
In fact,

309
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,210
he and his son one just released
a co written book in 2017.

310
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,000
Well,

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,140
he's incredibly wealthy.

312
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,810
He writes in sells books
at a breathtaking pace,

313
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,570
but he doesn't use his
wealth to amass stuff.

314
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,280
The antifa owned three houses,

315
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,720
two in Maine and one in Florida.

316
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,260
It's the house in Maine that is
the most iconic located in Bangor.

317
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:10,860
It's a huge old Victorian
surrounded by a wrought iron fence,

318
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,110
decorated with bats from the outside.

319
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,250
The house is exactly where one would
expect Stephen King to live on the inside.

320
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,460
It has an indoor swimming pool
and a huge on the ground library.

321
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,070
The houses are extravagance
by everyday standards,

322
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,850
but they really all the primary way king
prefers to spend money on himself and

323
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,600
Tabitha.

324
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,620
I'm not a clothes person.

325
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,610
I'm not a boat person.

326
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,870
We do have a house in Florida,

327
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,640
but we live in Maine for Christ's sake.

328
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,680
It's not like a trendy
community or anything.

329
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,150
His houses are beautiful,

330
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:38,340
but they don't use all
of his money so well.

331
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,390
What does he do with it all?

332
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,050
Well,

333
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,610
he gives it away my sleep more.

334
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:45,300
He invested in projects that support his
interests and just community and music.

335
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:48,060
Fan King has also pat just
radio stations in Maine,

336
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,140
a huge baseball fan.

337
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,810
He funded the construction of a
little league field in Bangalore.

338
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,270
The field is now known
as the field of screens,

339
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,370
a tip of the hat to the fields funder.

340
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,520
Together he and Tabitha run these
Steven and Tabitha King Foundation,

341
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,780
libraries and colleges,

342
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:04,470
especially the University of Maine in
the Bangor Public Library has benefited

343
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:07,260
from King's philanthropy
means historical society,

344
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
far departments,

345
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:12,420
arts organizations and hospitals have
also been beneficiaries of the kings.

346
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,480
In 1,801 speech at Vassar college king
made his view on generosity and charity

347
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:18,660
clear to his audience.

348
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,100
Should you give away what you have?

349
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,053
Of course you should.

350
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,500
I want you to consider making your lives
one long gift to others and why not?

351
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,030
All you have is on loan anyway.

352
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,610
All he wants to get asked at the
getting place from the Maserati.

353
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:33,180
You may dream about the retirement fund
some broker will trying to sell you on.

354
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,100
None of that is real well.

355
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,810
That last is what you pass on.

356
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,850
The rest is smoke and mirrors.

357
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,050
In that same speech,

358
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,830
he discussed natural resources and
his dislike of the George W dot Bush

359
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:47,580
administration with the advent of twitter
in the years to follow king has an

360
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:50,010
even wider audience to share
his political views with.

361
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,260
He's taken on president trump,

362
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:51,560
vice,

363
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,440
which are announcing that the president
wasn't allowed to see the new version of

364
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,960
it when it hit theaters in 2017.

365
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,780
He is also made clear in very
profane language and repeat it here,

366
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,800
what he thinks of the president
and his administration.

367
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,890
Stephen King is a national
figure in his own right.

368
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,843
For 30 years,

369
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,700
he has been affecting the
conversation around pop culture.

370
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,140
His books sell by the millions and his
movies rake in millions of dollars and

371
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,460
win Academy Awards.

372
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,120
Growing up,

373
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,290
he knew he wanted to write,

374
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,730
but he never wanted to do it.

375
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,320
To achieve the wealth and fame,

376
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,070
he's now a mast is reasoning is much
simpler and it remains his mentor.

377
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,923
To this day,

378
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,920
writing isn't about making money,

379
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:28,671
getting famous,

380
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:29,331
getting dates,

381
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:29,961
getting laid,

382
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,010
or making friends.

383
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,760
In the end,

384
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,840
it's about enriching the lives of those
who will read your work and enriching

385
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,370
your own life as well.

386
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,410
For over three decades from his home,

387
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,930
tucked away in the northeast
corner of the United States,

388
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,010
Stephen King has been able to live
out his childhood dream to write for a

389
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,580
living.

390
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,151
In doing so,

391
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,500
he's brought many of us nightmares,

392
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,311
the nightmares,

393
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:53,510
the world gladly welcomed as we
continue to delve into his stories,

394
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,340
so I really hope you found
that video interesting.

395
