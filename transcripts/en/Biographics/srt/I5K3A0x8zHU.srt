3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,700
Punch Aveo was one of the most divisive
figures in history to millions.

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:16,610
He was the Mexican or Robin Hood,

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,090
but to others he was a ruthless
terrorist who kills without conscience.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,990
What is without a doubt is that he rose
from humble beginnings to become one of

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:29,730
the most famous Mexicans in history
playing a vital role in the decades that

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,780
shaped modern Mexico.
In this week's biographics,

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,000
we discover the real story of Pancho via,

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,510
there's a lot of mystery surrounding the
early life of the man who became Pancho

11
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,920
via most historians believe that
he was born on the 5th of June,

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,390
1878 in the tiny village of Rancho
Delacroix Tada in the state of Durango and

13
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,950
Mexico. His birth name was Jose
Dora, Teo Aramco Aramco gala.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,850
When he was a few years old,
his father I boost in Aramco died.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,280
This meant that authority,
Teo,

16
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,560
the oldest of five children have
to start working on the Hacienda,

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,450
getting up at three
o'clock in the morning.

18
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,240
He had to walk for 10 miles
to start work at five.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,930
His work consisted of planting
corn and running errands via laser.

20
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:20,010
Claims that he never attended a
day of school and his entire life.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,881
When not working,

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,510
you'd like to play cards and it was
often getting into fights with his peers.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,381
During his teen.

24
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,170
He held a number of odd jobs including
and mule Skinner brick layer runs and

25
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:32,340
butch up. Then at the age of 16
you moved to Chihuahua for work.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,270
The story goes that two years later he
returned to his hometown in order to hunt

27
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:40,350
down a man named or Gustin Lopez and
a greater who had raped his sister.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,830
He apparently found the
rapist and kills him.

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,380
This episode is said to have
set him on his life of crime.

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,680
He fled to the Sierra Madre Mountains
and joined a group of bandits.

31
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:54,150
Changing his name to puncture via the
bands had soup numbers between 40 and 50

32
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:57,690
man rated the ranches of the wealthy
in order to steal castle and horses.

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,140
They lived in the mountains and
they train. Does guerrilla fighters,

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,980
their reputation as fighters against
the system established them as freedom

35
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:09,090
fighters in the minds of the poor who
gave them shelter and warn them when the

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,841
local police,

37
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:14,250
when we begin in 1902 via was captured
by the police according to the practice

38
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,040
of the times,
he was inducted into the federal army.

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,670
He spent several months in the army
and then dessert is heading back to the

40
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:24,690
hills to rejoin his gang. Around this
time, he actually kills an army officer,

41
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,750
which made him one of the most
wanted men in northern Mexico.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,840
A reward of 10,000 pesos was placed on
his hat pantry became the leader of his

43
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:36,870
band Dyk group and it's continued to
lead increasingly violent raids upon the

44
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:37,410
wealthy.

45
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,920
Legend says that he would risk capture
by openly walking through the streets of

46
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,130
shower to distribute money to the poor.
In so doing,

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,030
he won the loyalty of the people who
helps protect them from the authorities.

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,850
In 1910 Mexico's seemed to be a
model of democratic stability.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Porfirio Diaz had the president for 30
years and the country was celebrating a

50
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,190
hundred years of independence,

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,360
but Diaz rules with an iron fist and
the elections that were held every four

52
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,020
years, they were just a facade. In
order to appease foreign governments.

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,080
90% of people in Mexico lived in poverty
since 1906 there had been a number of

54
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:20,140
worker rebellions against the conditions
that they were forced to exist under.

55
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,500
Each one had been forcibly
put down by the Diaz regime.

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,530
A number of intellectuals began
writing against this regime,

57
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,740
including a man named Francisco Madero.

58
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,280
He decided to run for president in
1910 what his campaign began to gather

59
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,360
momentum. However, President Diaz had
Mindera arrested and thrown in prison.

60
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,650
The mock election went ahead and Diaz
was reelected for the seventh time,

61
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,160
but Arrow managed to escape from prison
and he fled to the United States.

62
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,220
From that, he began planning
for the revolution. Meanwhile,

63
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,030
down in Chihuahua pantry via had
established a kind of reputation as this

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,900
Mexican Robin Hood figure,
a champion of the underprivileged,

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,540
but he was also known to be a wild man.

66
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,190
He was a ruthless killer who would
shed blood with utter impunity seeking

67
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,060
respectability.

68
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,150
He met with a supporter of Francisco
Madeira by the name of Abraham Gonzalez by

69
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,720
aligning himself with Madeira.

70
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:14,650
Gonzalez told Pancho that he would be
able to reinvent himself as a legitimate

71
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,060
man of the people. They, uh,

72
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:20,710
agreed GNC through the support of his
bandage group behind this revolutionary

73
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,790
cause.
By now,

74
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,470
panacea developed a strong hatred for
the Diaz regime along with the landowners

75
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:29,170
and the police who had been
hunting him for more than a decade.

76
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,700
He and his men brought skills
to the revolution records
that had been hones over

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,180
years of rating, fighting and
debating the authorities in battle.

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,170
Pancho fought like a man possessed. And
now that he added an established cause,

79
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,850
he was even more ferocious.

80
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,060
He also proved himself to be
a master of military tactics,

81
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:50,320
brilliantly marshaling his small band
against much larger governmental forces on

82
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,260
one occasion of the battle
of Escobar's pantry.

83
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:55,150
But hat's upon planted sticks and it'll
just a full of the opposition into

84
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,200
thinking that he had a much larger
army than he actually did buy.

85
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,860
The beginning of 1911 though that me,

86
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,670
it had grown to 400 people and it was
racking up to slice of victories over the

87
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,504
federal army.

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,500
In early 1911 there was a challenge to
the revolutionary leadership of Madeira

89
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,640
from the ultra radical Mexican liberal
party to put down the challenge,

90
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,361
but they wrote turns,

91
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:16,690
a Pancho who moved in and
arrested the leaders of the Party,

92
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,130
the grateful Madeira rewarded via by
making him a kernel of his revolutionary

93
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,640
army.
In May,

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,680
1911 zero is 3000 strong force with
villa at the forefront laid siege to the

95
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,270
border city of Sia. Dot. Horace,

96
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,740
the town was gutted by 500 federal troops
along with 300 civilian auxiliaries

97
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,610
and local police.

98
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,090
The fighting went on for two days and at
the end the federal police surrendered

99
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,590
on May the 25th with his armies being
defeated and public opinion unanimously

100
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,190
against him.
President DNS resigns and fled into exile.

101
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,240
A free and fair election was housing,

102
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,170
which Francisco Madero was
elected presidents, Madeira.

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,130
He signed the Treaty of [inaudible] by
which the federal law me would remain in

104
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:57,680
place. He therefore disbanded the
rebel. Armenians ordered to returns.

105
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,760
They're pretty wild lives,

106
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,870
but Arrow allowed the structure of the
DNS government to remain to Banjo via

107
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,720
this was a fatal error. Bands, he let
his feelings be known. He told Maduro,

108
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,700
you have destroyed the revolution.
It's simple.

109
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,080
This bunch of Dandies of made a fool of
you and this will eventually cost us on

110
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,880
next,
including yours.

111
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,983
Yeah,

112
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,710
VM and his fellow revolutionaries were
also incense that Madeira refuse to

113
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,281
distribute,

114
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:32,630
sees hacienda land to veterans of the
struggle is payments for the services they

115
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:35,830
rendered via became increasingly
critical of Madeira is actions,

116
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,260
especially his putting a former
supporter of deposed president Dan says,

117
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,310
minister of war.

118
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,590
Even more outspoken was a
fellow revolutionary leader
by the name of Pascoe al

119
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:48,950
or Roscoe and March of 1912 or Roscoe
led a rebellion against the new regime.

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,130
The Dero called on Via to put it down,
just like being a judge,

121
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,910
devolving Orozco to join the revolts
panel showed that his army of 400 in

122
00:06:55,911 --> 00:07:00,911
conjunction with federal forces in a
series of decisive victories that crushed

123
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,490
the rebellion following
the victory against a row.

124
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,610
Vias bans joins up with federal militia
in the city of tare on in the state of

125
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,810
Quito. The federal commands a General
Victoria on a request out to tested via,

126
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,470
he was initially welcoming
though showering him with
praise and awarding him an

127
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,550
honorary general ship,

128
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,660
but the pleasantries they didn't last
long with quieter accusing pound show of

129
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,860
stealing a horse with his honor in
question via responded by slapping the

130
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,430
general.

131
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,420
This was the pretext that quota was off
to NZ promptly hand via arrested and

132
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:33,110
charged with insubordination and
execution by firing squad was ordered.

133
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,830
Word of this affair reached President
of Madeira who telegraph clatter and

134
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,950
ordered him to not execute via but to
keep him as a prisoner via was sent.

135
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:45,110
Do you bet on prison in Mexico City
while incarcerated that he runs a region

136
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,630
right under the guidance of
a fellow prisoner. In June,

137
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,030
he was transferred to
a prison in Santiago.

138
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,410
Six months later though he escaped jumping
on board a train bound for the United

139
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,970
States. On January the second
1913 he arrived in El Paso, Texas,

140
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,290
while in prison, penetrate learns
of a plant coup against Madero. Hey,

141
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,080
I attempted to get a warning
message through to the president,

142
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:07,940
but it didn't arrive in time.

143
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,590
On February the 22nd 1913 Dario was gunned
down on the orders of general quarter.

144
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,480
The man who had come so close to executing
via just a year earlier question now

145
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:21,410
installed himself as the new president
of Mexico via was incensed that the

146
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,310
series of events,

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,180
even though he had become disillusioned
with his actions upon gaining power,

148
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:30,860
he still viewed Madeira as the apostle
of democracy and just personal role

149
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,550
model.
Now the Cueto his personal enemy was in,

150
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,960
he knew that he had to return to Mexico.

151
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,860
He indeed felt that the
mantle of completing the
dream of democracy the Madeira

152
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:44,150
had instilled in him was now
upon his shoulders. Okay,

153
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:47,510
so now just before we get into vias,
really brutal phase of life,

154
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,760
it's time for me to quickly
tell you about scripts.

155
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,200
Script provides you with a huge library
of books, audio books, magazines,

156
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,010
and other reading material.

157
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,910
They allow you access to an unlimited
number of these every month.

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,540
I actually had a membership to squibs
before they even came on board as a

159
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,130
sponsor for this show.

160
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,550
As I made a covenant to read
more in 2019 specifically,

161
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:12,240
I said that I wanted to finish
20 nonfiction books this year.

162
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,720
So script with that unlimited
plan is perfect for my goal. Also,

163
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm reading more magazines
time Macworld Inc.

164
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,690
It's incredible what you can get
for any $8 and 99 cents a month.

165
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't really know how they do it for
any $8 and 99 cents a month because I

166
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,590
certainly feel that books
are more expensive than that
audio book certainly are.

167
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,040
I even think some magazines probably
more expensive than $8 a month,

168
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,860
so I said how they do it,
but it's a good deal. Now,

169
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:38,940
a book that was essential in creating
this video was the mega in depth of the

170
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:43,110
life and times of Pancho villa and you
can grab that on the script if you want

171
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:45,870
more or personally, I've been
reading a book called the innovators,

172
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,020
which is entirely unrelated to this video,

173
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,110
but it's actually amazing and I
couldn't not bring it up. Like I said,

174
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,050
I'm trying to read 20 books
and this is one of them.

175
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:59,430
It's all about people who created the
Internet and computers, the innovators.

176
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,620
You can probably see where the
title comes from. Like I say,

177
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,470
it's not related at all.
I just couldn't not mention it.

178
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,420
You can read that book
or the Pantry Veo one.

179
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:09,360
You can find a link to do that below,
through that link.

180
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:13,410
You get 30 days for free and like I said,
you can get any book your wines,

181
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,520
just why not and thanks for script for
sponsoring this video and let's get back

182
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,354
into it.

183
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,920
Except for the wealthy businessmen who
were sort of relieved by this return to

184
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:32,300
order the vast majority viewed
quarter as a jackal who had stolen the

185
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:36,140
presidency. In March of 1913
Pancho via returns in Mexico,

186
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,610
intense on avenging the murder of
Madeira and relieving his country of the

187
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:41,990
tyranny of quieter.

188
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,550
He later recalled that night I had eight
men with me and we had no definite plan,

189
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:51,050
but I decided to make for my old haunts
in the Sierra Madre mountains where I

190
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,110
knew I could find men to follow me.
We had one sack of flour,

191
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,860
two small packages of coffee and some
salts. That's was all our food supply.

192
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,420
Of course, we were all well armed, but
had little ammunition via small bands,

193
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:05,860
began making lightning raids upon the
federal forces that were garrison did

194
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,820
northern Mexican towns and forts.

195
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,150
Slowly they were able to accumulate
the arms and supplies that they needed

196
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,570
within a week. Vias, bans, it's
groans or more than a hundred men.

197
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,630
And within three months it had morphed
into a legitimate army of 18,000 troops

198
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,870
in battle. The uh, proved to be
ruthless is standard policy was to kill.

199
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:27,350
Prisoners are lucky if you would only be
spared by the intervention of his left

200
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
hand. It's in contrast to this
brutal side of his nature.

201
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,410
They Pancho who had a strong
social conscience for two months.

202
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:36,620
In 1913 he held the position
of governor of Chihuahua.

203
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,860
He expropriated lands from the
wealthy to distribute to the poor,

204
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,370
opened at several schools and enacted
laws to protect widows and orphans.

205
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,870
On Christmas Day 1913,

206
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,920
he gathered the poor of Gor together
and gave them each 15 pesos.

207
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,850
They subtractions. He became the hero
and the savior of the underclass.

208
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,470
By 1914 they had control over
the northern parts of Mexico.

209
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,730
I'm thinking over the governorship to
his left tenancy began the march south to

210
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:04,690
Mexico City. You are quiet or sat in
the presidential chat as he swept,

211
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,640
Southie conquered
everything in his weight,

212
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,450
gaining a reputation as the center
of the north. By June, his arm,

213
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:15,070
he had grown to 50,000 most of whom
were riding on horseback by now.

214
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,820
It was a fully fledged army with mobile
hospitals and recruits from other

215
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,880
countries including the United States.
At the head of this,

216
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,890
the largest revolutionary army and the
history of the Americas stood Pancho via

217
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,140
Lido with great charisma who at the
same time as the respect and fear rivers

218
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:36,940
Madden and developed a military strategy
that proved enormously successful day

219
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,660
and night.

220
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,860
He would pour a continuous
frontal assaults against
the enemy lines supported by

221
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,760
cavalry troops.

222
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,080
The attacks were continually ruling with
troops of the France being replaced by

223
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,680
those behind this gave the defenders
and no time to rest resulting in them

224
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,380
almost always being overwhelmed by
this sustained form of attack via also

225
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,570
established offices within his army is
similar to governmental departments.

226
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,960
He had an office of foreign affairs who
were particularly focused on reaching

227
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,120
out to President Woodrow Wilson for USAID.

228
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,570
His financial committee made contact with
wealthy landowners to assure them that

229
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:09,970
they would not be mistreated
once a victory was achieved.

230
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,090
The United States provided aid
to the revolutionary cause.

231
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:17,680
Three around about means
via sold livestock and other
products to the u s which

232
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,370
provided the funds with which to
purchase American weapons and ammunition.

233
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,950
It was this flow of weaponry.

234
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,490
This enabled the rebel army to match up
to the federal forces in recognition of

235
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:31,660
the aid being received from north of
the border via ensured that no American

236
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,860
property was confiscated.

237
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,550
Positive Press and the American media
resulted with the Washington Times

238
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:41,551
reporting in January of
1914 via is carrying on a
campaign of modern and humane

239
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:46,750
wharf APP. The media sort of fell
in love with via with one editor.

240
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,750
Writing Vr is without the possibility
of any doubt the greatest leader Mexico

241
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,850
has ever had.
His method of fighting is astonishing.

242
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,470
Like Napoleon's via instituted some
telling innovations in Mexican warfare.

243
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,430
He was the first to leave the women and
children behind and forced the pace of

244
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:06,580
his army with raids marching
far away from his face.

245
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,780
He would abandon his supply trains and
had far out in search of the enemy.

246
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,780
He was also the first
stage of nighttime attacks,

247
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,300
which became especially
devastating to the enemy.

248
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,470
In the spring of 1914 the two
key cities of Toryonn and Zach,

249
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:20,500
a k test were taken.

250
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,730
These victories brought the regime to its
knees with quite a fleeing into exile.

251
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,680
On July the 14th,
1914,

252
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,980
the federal army collapsed to
leaving the revolutionary step,

253
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,010
fill the vacuum into the presidency.
Now stabbed Veneziano,

254
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,360
Carranza raw former Hacienda Rhona who
brought his forces into Mexico City.

255
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:41,230
I had a via, yet it was penetrating the,
uh, who was the hero of the revolution.

256
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,870
Wherever he went,
people would yell out via

257
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,101
via.

258
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:54,101
And his fellow revolutionary leader is a
potter joined forces to Alice Carranza,

259
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,950
who they had never intended to take
the helm on December the sixth, 1914,

260
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,540
the road to the head of 50,000 men
along sides apart or with his 15,000.

261
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,850
By then grounds,
a hood is naturally flat.

262
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:08,630
The capital [inaudible] was now at the
height of its power wearing a navy blue

263
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,360
suit and to cap with the Eagle
of the Mexican flag on us.

264
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,100
He rode through the city as the masses
turned out to shower him with praise.

265
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,580
He went to the presidential palace
and sat on the presidential chair,

266
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,740
but only long enough to
have his picture taken.

267
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,660
He never served as the
president of Mexico,

268
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,600
although he could have easily
won an election. At that time,

269
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,620
a council between the various fighting
factions failed to bring a consensus and

270
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,920
via continue to lead his army
against the pockets of rebellion.

271
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,810
Alvaro Obregon was a supporter of Carranza
who won a series of decisive battles

272
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,431
against vias.

273
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:43,610
Army Pancho was outsmarted by Abra
gone and many of his men were killed.

274
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,120
He was forced to retreat to his base and
the northern Sierra Maestra mountains.

275
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,110
In a few months if fierce fighting the
invincible Ami that had marched into

276
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:56,030
Mexico City had been reduced to a
ragtag mob of just a few hundred men.

277
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,780
The change now came over
Pancho via his violent streak.

278
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,660
It was fully unleashed in
San Pedro de la quaver.

279
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,380
He brought all of the men in town into
the middle of the town and killed them

280
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:16,730
all personally shooting the local priest
in the hat. Then in Santa Isabella,

281
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,430
he shot several American minors.
The Americans,

282
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,280
they now distance themselves from via.

283
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,350
Recognize the re-instituted
Cameron's and government.

284
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,430
At around four in the morning on March
the ninth of 1916 via the incense,

285
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:32,000
the President Wilson had legitimize the
Koran's and government let a force of

286
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:35,900
100 men across the border into
the town of Columbus, New Mexico.

287
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,800
They're tacked the town of 600
inhabitants from four directions using

288
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,300
indiscriminately as well as the looting
and burning buildings via however had

289
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,800
chosen the wrong town.

290
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,150
The 13th us cavalry was stationed there
with four machine guns and 400 highly

291
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:52,790
trained soldiers.
The majority of his men were killed.

292
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,690
The bus via managed to get away, leaving
a trail of destruction in its wake.

293
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,980
The American response to the unprovoked
Columbus attack was an overwhelming at

294
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:05,981
10,000 troops being sent on trains south
of the border with the single objective

295
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,410
of capturing Poncho via the head of the
American forces was John Passion that

296
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,730
his troops along with Apache Indian scouts
350 miles across the border and such

297
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:21,550
a via into every village that he weds
Pershing would yell out where his Poncho

298
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,770
via every time though the locals would
provide him with false information.

299
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,790
On several occasions,

300
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,540
portions of Pershing's army skirmished
with via and his tiny bands.

301
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,490
On one occasion,
Pancho was shot in the leg in April.

302
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:35,930
The American newspapers actually reported
that he had died as a result of the

303
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:36,890
leg being infected.

304
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,940
The reality though was the pantry was
still very much alive though badly wounded

305
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:44,750
and hiding out in a cave in the Sierra
Madre is Pershing's expedition in managed

306
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,130
to capture weaponry and horses,

307
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,370
but it failed in its objective of
bringing pantry with the Americans having

308
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:53,340
withdrawn via reverted to
his gorilla fighting ways.

309
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,180
He's still that the support of the
people and was determined to continue

310
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,280
fighting against horrendous regime.

311
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,780
Then in 1920 with another coup in the
offing president's Carranza was killed as

312
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,260
he fled to the Gulf of Mexico
with the national treasure VM.

313
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,730
Saw this turn of events is his opportunity
to come to a peace settlement with a

314
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:14,340
new regime he rode for 13 days to a city
where he telegraph the new president

315
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:16,830
Adolfo Dlo Cata requesting an amnesty.

316
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,910
Quite agreed grateful that the threat
of a via overthrow was nullified

317
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,650
via was given a 25,000
acre farm in Canada tear.

318
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,820
He brought 200 of his men with him who
immediately got to work on improving the

319
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,710
rundown property in a
short amount of time.

320
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:40,610
This area was tend to do a communist had
a school and it grew wheat and corn and

321
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:41,151
bean crops.

322
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:45,650
They were able to support the large
community via got up each day to supervise

323
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,490
the work and spend time
in the school house.

324
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,470
Peep hardly bevel left the farm because
he was fearful of being assassinated.

325
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,220
On the morning of July the 20th
1923 via did leaf his ranch.

326
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,120
He went to parral to visit one of his
wives and to withdraw money to pay his

327
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:03,590
work. It's as, as dodge
vehicle was driving through
eight deserted part of town,

328
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,600
dozens of snipers opened up filling
the car with more than 40 bullet holes.

329
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,510
Nine of these bullets, they
entered pantry fee. His body,

330
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,980
his death was instantaneous. Yet even
in death, Viet did not find peace.

331
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,840
Three years after his burial and
parral whose tomb was ransacked,

332
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,800
the corpse was removed with
the head being cut off.

333
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,070
Souvenir hunters also took pieces
of the coffin and some of his bones.

334
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,150
In 2010 the Wall Street Journal reported
that his right index finger was being

335
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,460
offered at a pawn shop in El Paso.

336
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,680

hope you found that video. Interesting.
