1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,900
To some,

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,150
he was the very embodiment of evil,

3
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,480
the psychopathic incarnation
of the devil himself.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,051
To others,

5
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,030
he was a god fearing
defender of the faith,

6
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,380
courageously standing up to the
feared Ottoman Empire in his time,

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,890
he was known as Vlad the impaler thanks
to his favorite method of executing

8
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,760
people today,

9
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:22,230
though we remember him as the real life
inspiration for bram stoker's infamous

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,580
prince of darkness.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,250
In this week's biographics,

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,400
we discover the gruesome truth
about the real flat Dracula,

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,880
Vlad Dracula future prints of where
they here was born in either November or

14
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,320
December of 14,

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,480
31 in the northern Romanian state.

16
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,290
If we lay here,

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,260
his father flap.

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,100
The second was to become ruler of flakier.

19
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,020
In the year of his second son's birth,

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,010
Vlad senior joined in 90 society
known as the order of the dragons.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,330
Upon his induction,

22
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:02,090
he was given the surname draggle,

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,080
which is a derivative of Drac,

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,210
meaning dragon in ancient Romanian.

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,781
However,

26
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,160
in the modern Romanian language,

27
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,570
this means devil.

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,130
His son was given the name for
some of that being dracula,

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,930
the world of land was born into.

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,860
It was a violent one,

31
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,890
consumed with disputes over
territory and rulership,

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,280
family name and Ana were
the most important thing,

33
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,430
something which was drummed
into the boy from the start.

34
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,570
He also understood that the goal was
to push the boundaries of the empire

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,520
regardless of the cost,

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,660
the order of the Dragon,

37
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,190
which Vlad scene he became a part of,

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,910
was committed to defending
Christianity against the haters.

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,370
Ottoman Turks at the
time of his son's birth,

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,641
Vad.

41
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:45,230
The second served as a guard commander
in the mountain passes and we're like

42
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:45,510
here,

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,460
we don't actually know who've lads,

44
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,110
mother was when Vlad was born.

45
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,240
His father was married
to princess and nature,

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,230
but he also had a string of mistresses
and anyone could have given birth to the

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,630
future.

48
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,290
Dracula lands formative
years were spent in ct,

49
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:58,920
so IRA,

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,610
when his father ascended to the
throne of weather here in 1436,

51
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:06,270
he brought Vlad and his younger brother
Ragu to live in the royal court in the

52
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:06,840
capital.

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,281
The boys.

54
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:10,860
It would have been educated at home by
Greek and Roman scholars who their father

55
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,630
had brought in from Constantinople.

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,350
They would have busied themselves with
learning the rudiments of mathematics,

57
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:16,980
geography,

58
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,521
science,

59
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,860
and languages including old church,

60
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,640
slavonic,

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,240
German,

62
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,073
and Latin,

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,580
that's their privileged upbringing,

64
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:27,810
was rudely interrupted when their father
was ousted as real of a rival group who

65
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,910
were in league with the Hungarians.

66
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,370
Glad senior built an alliance
with the Ottoman Sea,

67
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,490
agreed to help him regain his throne
on the proviso that he paid tribute to

68
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,720
Sultan macramed the seconds and so that
he leave his two sons at the Ottoman

69
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,520
court as a guarantee of his loyalty
labs had no choice and the two boys were

70
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,320
seized and made prisoners,

71
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,820
although relatively well treated,

72
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:58,410
the boys were able to observe the Turkish
use of Taran as an instrument in order

73
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,770
to achieve ends.

74
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,850
This was something which Vlad would use
to great effect nature in his own life

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,140
while in the Ottoman court.

76
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:09,010
So the boys were able to further their
education being instructed in logic,

77
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,680
the Turkish language and
the teachings of the Koran.

78
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,000
They were also given lessons
in horsemanship and warfare.

79
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,060
The two brothers differ markedly and
their attitude towards their captivity.

80
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,551
Roger,

81
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:20,530
either younger brother,

82
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,640
he accepted the situation and embraced
his new life and the teachings that came

83
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,180
with it,

84
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,870
it would eventually converted Islam
and to service in the Ottoman court.

85
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,470
Vlad,

86
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,040
however,

87
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,750
resistant as every turn,

88
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,830
despite constant punishments for is
certainly attitudes with the assistance of

89
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,550
the Turks.

90
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,370
Lads senior was able to regain his throne,

91
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,430
but this wasn't something
that lasted in 14.

92
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,920
40 seven Hungarian backs,

93
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,220
rebels attacked again,

94
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,370
forcing Vlad and his oldest son Messier
the second to fleet both were eventually

95
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,240
captured and put to death.

96
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,480
The next in line to the throne of
winter here was vlad the third,

97
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,350
his older brother,

98
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,200
but he had become a monk
and lived in a monastery.

99
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,220
This left Vlad who is now 16 as
the rightful heir to the throne.

100
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,640
Despite his obstinate and see the
Turks had grown fond of the teenager.

101
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,920
They vowed to help him regain his throne,

102
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,610
which they did with an overthrow
of the rebel ruler in 1448.

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,640
As soon as the Ottomans left,

104
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,030
however,

105
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,140
the Hungarians were back and within
two months flat was forced to flee to

106
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,510
Moldova for the next three years.

107
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:30,530
He lived there under the protection and
tutelage of his uncle Prince Bogdan the

108
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:31,190
seconds,

109
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,650
but when Bogdan was assassinated in 1450,

110
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,670
one flat again,

111
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,370
fled this time along with
his cousin print steven,

112
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,180
the two young men ended up in Transylvania
where they came onto the mentorship

113
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,820
of a Hungarian warrior named John,

114
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,660
who knew Yardi.

115
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,180
He was a power broker who was fiercely
opposed to the Ottoman Empire from Yardi,

116
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,260
had originally supported the new
ruler of a man by the name of gladys.

117
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,290
Love the seconds,

118
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,660
but the relationship it
quickly disintegrated.

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,340
This was thanks largely to that slavs
appeasement of the Turks when Vladislav

120
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,190
invaded in several
villages in Transylvania.

121
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,630
When yardies patients,

122
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,890
it's simply gave out,

123
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,980
he looks young blast to take back the
throne that rightfully belonged to him.

124
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,070
In the same year,

125
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,461
14,

126
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:14,001
53,

127
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,690
the holy Roman city of Constantinople
fell to the Ottoman Turks.

128
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,920
It's now appeared as if the whole
of Europe was theirs for the taking.

129
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,010
The securing of way here became
more important than ever,

130
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,970
and in 14,

131
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:29,150
56 land led an army into the area.

132
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,760
He meets the army of Lattice
love on the field of battle,

133
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:36,761
ended up killing the usurper in hand to
hand combat with the death of gladys.

134
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,171
Slava.

135
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,750
Vlad was restored power as the ruler
of Lakeea over the next six years,

136
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,670
he would rule with an
unprecedented bloodlust that
would cement his name forever

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,450
in the annals of merciless monarchs,

138
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,710
having secured the throne
of Lakeea for himself,

139
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,080
God sends a portion of his army
over the border to help his cousin,

140
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,650
steven,

141
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,110
to secure the throne of Moldova.

142
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,220
When this was accomplished,

143
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:07,580
the two cousins held sway over
a large swath of the Balkans,

144
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,670
proving a powerful strong hold against
the tax lads now set his mind on revenge.

145
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,080
He had his spies go and find the names
of any nobles who had even been remotely

146
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,540
involved in the plot to
overthrow his father.

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,200
Having collected a list of names of
lads invited the men to an Easter feast

148
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,430
along with their families,

149
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,620
but as soon as the traders arrived,

150
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,730
they were arrested.

151
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,280
The older among them
were impaled venom there,

152
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,260
right in front of their families.

153
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,340
Those who are younger,

154
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,780
we're forced into slavery,

155
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,060
laboring to rebuild Vlads causal.

156
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,991
When this job was done,

157
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:43,460
the they were all killed vlads treatments
of the traitors to his father's reign.

158
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,630
It was just the beginning.

159
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,070
He next proceeded to enforce his own
stringent moral code on the entire

160
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,904
population.

161
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,390
Any deviation was met
with unthinkable cruelty.

162
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,200
He seemed to be especially
concerned with female chastity.

163
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,820
Any woman who lost her virginity prior
to marriage or who defiled the marriage

164
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,720
bed would be impaled with the
insertion points being the vagina.

165
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,920
More often than not,

166
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,190
their breasts would also be cut off
with a man with whom they had committed

167
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:11,024
fornication.

168
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,650
Being forced to eat them.

169
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,970
Labs also has a hatred of
beggars considering them
to be existing off the hard

170
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,804
work of others.

171
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,860
It is said that he once invited all the
baggers in with her to a massive feast

172
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,030
in a centrally located,

173
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:24,620
wouldn't hold one day at Eaton,

174
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,370
do their full.

175
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,340
He is said to have ordered the
doors bolted in the building,

176
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,270
set on fire.

177
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:29,961
In this way,

178
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,560
he is said to have read his
realm of the scourge of poverty

179
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,800
on the international scene.

180
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,990
The ultimate threads was
becoming more ominous.

181
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,950
In 1460,

182
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:47,570
Pope Pius the second held a congress that
man to her initially calling for a new

183
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:52,190
crusade to reclaim constantinople and
push the Ottomans back to the desert.

184
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,940
The crusade was to last for three years
and will be led by Mathias Covinas.

185
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,040
He was the son of John in Yardi,

186
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,710
who had been killed during
an invasion of Serbia.

187
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,490
Martinez,

188
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,030
made a tour of European kingdoms
seeking support for the enterprise.

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,360
The only ruler who gave a
positive response was flat.

190
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,200
Dracula overlay here determines to
hold his kingdom safe from the texts.

191
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,170
He formed an alliance
with Mathias veinous,

192
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,100
the Ottomans,

193
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,610
meanwhile,

194
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,850
well aware of the lack of
support for this new crusade.

195
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,800
Sultan Mac mid the second
seized the advantage by
capturing the last independent

196
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,790
Serbian city smatter Rovio.

197
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,760
During this campaign,

198
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,030
the Hungarian general.

199
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,670
Now Holly says Lagi was taken captive.

200
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,660
This general was knowns of lads
having helps put down a revolt in 15,

201
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:36,470
48.

202
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,030
When Vlad heard that he had been sought
in half his blood boils and he became

203
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,410
more committed than ever to teaching the
Ottomans a lesson that they would never

204
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,250
forget.

205
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,660
The ultimate empire extended degrees in
40 slash 61 when the we grew surrendered

206
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,460
without putting up any defense.

207
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,761
Now,

208
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:56,970
both Corinth and the capital
of Mr were ruled by the Turks.

209
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,270
The sultan also had his sights on here.

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,160
He declared it to be part of the
Ottoman Empire as song she sent envoys,

211
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:08,161
Div Lance Castle in order to collect a
tribute of 10,000 buckets along with 500

212
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,450
men to be taken into.

213
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,440
The TAC is Shami,

214
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,620
but the sultan had
underestimated the young ruler

215
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,541
when the sultans,

216
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:19,991
envoys,

217
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:23,200
refused to lift that Tibetans
as a sign of respect to him.

218
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,870
Vlad became enraged and times is God's
drive nails through their turbans and

219
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,480
into their skulls the incredible assault
and responded by sending his army

220
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:35,560
across the Danube in order to seize the
men and bring them back to become a part

221
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,340
of his army.

222
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,790
Lot centers forces to the area to
grab any tax that could be found.

223
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,680
They will soon impaled on red
hot stakes towards the end of 14,

224
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:48,820
61 bladder wrote to the salt and informing
him that he could not afford to pay a

225
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,360
tribute,

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,360
but that he was coming to Constantinople
and was ready to negotiate.

227
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,230
Macramed was aware of of laddered
already aligned himself with the crusade,

228
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,700
so we decided to take the way he and
ruler who her dad to murder his invoice by

229
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:01,510
force.

230
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,750
He sent one of his generals along with
a thousand strong cavalry to meet with

231
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,150
land with the intention of ambushing him,

232
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,530
but Vlad got wind of the plan that's
put into operation is I an ambush as the

233
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:12,460
approaching tax.

234
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,620
We're negotiating their way through
a narrow traverse that and army they

235
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,320
attacked.

236
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,190
It hasn't been reported.

237
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:22,360
That vlans attack was one of the first
instances where gun powder was used.

238
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,040
Apparently two deadly effects.

239
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,820
The dogs work ells with many of them
suffering of lance favorite torture,

240
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,310
and that was of course
impalements with his blood.

241
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:30,521
Now,

242
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:34,330
up flat took his army across the Danube
River where they attacked Ottoman

243
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,910
controlled areas in Bulgaria
between Saudi or in the Black Sea,

244
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,560
were given advanced,

245
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,760
do fortify towns and use his
skills in the Turkish language.

246
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:44,980
Do encourage the gods do open the gates,

247
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,880
then is Ami would pour in from over
the horizon that would then go into a

248
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,660
killing frenzy.

249
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,030
Slaughtering every Turkish man,

250
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,040
woman or child that he could find.

251
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,810
Over a period of two weeks,

252
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:59,260
he lead his army over
an area of 500 miles,

253
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,490
carrying around 23,000
people in February of 14,

254
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:08,491
62 vlad ropes in glowing terms to Mathias
covinas about what he had accomplished

255
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,850
in red.

256
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,470
I've killed peasant men and women,

257
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,480
young and old who lived at oblong sits
on and Novo Selo where the Danube flows

258
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,970
into the sea up to [inaudible],

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,780
which is located near chillier from the
lower Danube to such places as some of

260
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,030
us and Gagan.

261
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,330
We Killed Twenty 3,884 tax
without counting those,

262
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,620
and we burned in homes or the tax
whose heads were cut by our soldiers.

263
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,190
Thus,

264
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,000
your highness,

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you must know I've broken the piece and
outraged Sultan ordered his grand vizier

266
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,070
Mac mode with 18,000 troops to destroy
a port in well Lakeea Code Brailler.

267
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,770
This force was intercepted by
Vlad and this 30,000 strong army.

268
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,450
The Turks were utterly defeated with
only 8,000 of them surviving these quick

269
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:53,920
five victories and flat,

270
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,200
a heroic reputation throughout Europe.

271
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,660
Even the pope praised
him at the same time,

272
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:03,130
his reputation as the impaler king
served to intimidate the Turkish people,

273
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,050
many of whom plans the European part
of the Ottoman Empire for Anatolia in

274
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:11,440
response to the slaughter and the fear
that Vlad had caused amongst his people.

275
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,940
Salton macramed abandoned his campaign
and Greece and turns his attention to the

276
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,810
problem.

277
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,670
He gathered an army of 150,000 people
with the sole mission of finding and

278
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,390
killing.

279
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,170
Vlad.

280
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,680
The Sultan had already
promised the rulership of
relay here to of lands younger

281
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,990
brother Randy with himself after the head,

282
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,920
the Salton set out to find and kill flat

283
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,003
payless

284
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,160
force of around 13,000.

285
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,030
We're not saying the hugely outnumbered.

286
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,410
They were also hopelessly out classed
as far as weaponry was concerned.

287
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,780
They carried only launces and daggers,

288
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:53,770
whereas the text had in their midst
squadrons of deadly arches along with

289
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:55,750
powerful siege and muscle weaponry.

290
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,480
Despite this Vlad was able to inflict
major casualties upon the sultans forces,

291
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,420
he followed a scorched earth policy
as he moved away from the approaching.

292
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,570
Tax Wells were poisoned
with entire populations,

293
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:09,970
including animals being evacuated,

294
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,240
also engaged in guerrilla
fighting tactics.

295
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:13,841
Hit and run.

296
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:17,950
Raids were made on the sultan's army and
as a primitive type of germ warfare was

297
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,820
also utilized were men who were
afflicted with the bubonic plague,

298
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,290
was sent in Turkish towns,

299
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,420
do in fact as many people as possible.

300
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,540
The tactic works with the
plague spreading to the sultans.

301
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,800
Men in the end though,

302
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,820
the efforts of lads,

303
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:35,410
men were no more than an irritant
to the vastly superior Turkish army.

304
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,011
Steadily.

305
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:40,170
They moved on getting ever closer to the
castle when they arrived there and does

306
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,490
24,000 men,

307
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,760
strong army were holed up in the mountain
refuge just outside of the city of

308
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,640
that who was now faced with
an encircled by the Turks,

309
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:52,270
which would eventually forces army
into starvation did something quite

310
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:55,840
extraordinary even for him leaving
his men behind in the mountains.

311
00:13:55,841 --> 00:14:00,190
He disguised himself and walked directly
into the Turkish army encampments.

312
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,040
He quickly determines the
position of the sultans tent.

313
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,700
He founds out that the sultan had given
the order for his men to remain in their

314
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:11,140
tents at night in order to prevent panic
in the event of an attack even quietly

315
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,200
slipped out of the camp and
returned back to his own men,

316
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,821
lads,

317
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,980
and help set about planning a
surprise attack on the sultan's army.

318
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,290
It was his personal intention to enter.

319
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,770
The sultans tends to drive a knife through
Mac meds heart on the night of June

320
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:25,331
the 17,

321
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:25,781
14,

322
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,470
62,

323
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,090
he divided his forces into two man's
then attacked from both the north and the

324
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:31,780
south.

325
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,040
The Turks were caught off guard allowing
the attackers to inflect heavy losses

326
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,900
within an hour of savage fighting.

327
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,020
More than 15,000 Turks were slaughtered
at a cost of some five thousands of lads

328
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:43,900
men.

329
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,770
He himself succeeded in entering the
tents that he had previously picked out.

330
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,100
The only problem was that he had selected
the wrong tense and founds no salt and

331
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:52,870
insight.

332
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,330
A daybreak flags cooled off the attack
and his men melted back into the

333
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,050
mountains.

334
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,010
The sultan was so despondent
that he pulled back and
was prepared to retreat all

335
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,690
the way back across the Denewb.

336
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,201
However,

337
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:07,550
he was convinced by his generals that
success with still within their grasp and

338
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,370
so he led his men into the capital city.

339
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,700
When they arrived in [inaudible],

340
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,000
the tilex founds an abandoned city.

341
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,770
They also found the remains of 20,000
Turkish soldiers killed in previous

342
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,930
conflicts and impaled on steaks.

343
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,973
At this site,

344
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,690
the sultan is said to have remarked,

345
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,550
a man who has done such things is worth
much with nothing to do in the empty

346
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,000
city the sultan installed,

347
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,300
do as the new ruler of delay here,

348
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,950
and then turned and began to retrace
his steps back to the denewb rather than

349
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,360
the younger brother of labs.

350
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:43,220
Now I'm talking as forces and circled
vlads castle and located on a cliff just

351
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,830
outside of the city lands.

352
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,890
First wife within the castle legend has
it that she found to feed herself to the

353
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,440
fishes rather than full to the tax.

354
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,160
Apparently she threw herself from
the walls into the river below.

355
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,810
Rather,

356
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,090
you set about solidifying his position.

357
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,631
Meanwhile,

358
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:07,560
the Sultan had taken his army airway to
brayleigh where the town was destroyed

359
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:08,970
and hundreds were killed.

360
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,230
Vlad knew that he had to regroup and
gather a larger force if he was have any

361
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,020
chance of regaining control of relay.

362
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,540
Here he made his way to Hungary
where he sought the help of his ally.

363
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,840
Macias Cornice Matteo's
appeared to give us support,

364
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:24,360
even making battle plans with labs.

365
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:24,931
However,

366
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:27,750
covertness had secretly
turned against his old ally.

367
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,770
You organized the plans,

368
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:29,760
you ambush vlad.

369
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,830
The impaler was taken
as this prison prisoner.

370
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,430
The reason for Matty as this change
of loyalty has been debated now for

371
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:40,080
centuries with the consensus being that
he wanted to become holy Roman emperor

372
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,090
and knew that an end to hostilities
with the tax was needed before they can

373
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:49,770
become a reality land spent the next
four years as a prisoner and hungry.

374
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,611
During this time,

375
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,110
he converted to Catholicism.

376
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,850
He also met king metastasis,

377
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,850
cousin having softened his
attitude towards this prisoner.

378
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,620
Mateus allowed the to to marry.

379
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,700
Apparently he was released just prior to
the ceremony land and his new wife were

380
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,481
given a house.

381
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,140
It passed.

382
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,640
It was under strict
instructions not to return to.

383
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:06,890
We're like,

384
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,340
yeah,

385
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,581
yeah,

386
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:07,800
this.

387
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,420
He had no intention of giving up on the
crown that still rightly belongs to him.

388
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,360
He secretly collaborations with
a former military commander.

389
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,320
They managed to gather together and Ami
consisting of a mixture of Hungarian

390
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:24,120
Transylvanian well Adrian and Moldavia
and forces of land set out with his

391
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:27,420
makeshift Ami in the
middle of 1476 by now.

392
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,100
His younger brother Randy would died and
they had been replaced by Prince busop.

393
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,370
The elder before flatted
even God photography shared
the Saab and his army had

394
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:35,910
flat.

395
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,510
Vlad was placed on the throne
and the army largely dissolved.

396
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,070
Labs was back in power,

397
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,600
but he lacked a strong army.

398
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:42,991
In fact,

399
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,180
he only had around 4,000 men to draw upon,

400
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,960
so when the tax returns two months
after his retaking of the throne,

401
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,910
he was soundly defeated.

402
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,450
The exact details surrounding his
death are a master of some debates.

403
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,070
Most scholars agree that he was killed
while fighting the techs in early 14,

404
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,970
77,

405
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,500
a contemporary Turkish
chronicle a recorded that the
tax killed and decapitated

406
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:10,770
him,

407
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,870
sending his head back to Constantinople.

408
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,651
There it is,

409
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:17,130
said to have been presented in honey
and to put on display so that everyone

410
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,000
could see that the graduate
impaler was really finally debt.

411
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,450
It is estimated that Vlans,

412
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,240
legacy of execution methods included
more than 20,000 impalements,

413
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,830
5,000 beheadings,

414
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,710
10,000 burnings at stake,

415
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,501
tend to x.

416
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:35,610
You had nails driven through that turbans
and at least one who was boiled alive

417
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,100
and then cannibalized,

418
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,250
yet in his home country of
Romania flat is seen as a hero.

419
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,110
Here's an important national figure,

420
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,430
a god fearing it.

421
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,680
Who stood up to the Ottoman Empire?

422
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,783
Well,

423
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,800
I guess it all depends
on your perspective,

424

so I really hope you enjoyed that video.
