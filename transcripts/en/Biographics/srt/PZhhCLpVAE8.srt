1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,290
He is the most famous person on the
planet and is the most divisive,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,780
equally loved equally of horse.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,860
It is impossible not to have an opinion
about the brash Twitter loving 45th

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,570
president of the United States.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,350
Yet few people truly understand
what makes Trump Trump.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,700
By going back into his past,

7
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:21,600
we are able to gain valuable insight into
the vast complexities that make up the

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,170
man.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,360
In this week's biographics,

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,240
we're looking at the Donald's before you
took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania

11
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:28,074

He brought with him a reputation as
one of the finest builders of his

17
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,650
generation.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,250
Frederick helps to change the face
of Queens with his building projects.

19
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,040
They primarily consisted of
the construction of solids,

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,410
the basic brick rental apartments.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,280
Fred followed his father's path and
became a prominent residential developer.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,930
By the time Donald was in his teen years.

23
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:14,370
His father had a mass more than 27,000
apartments in such Brooklyn suburbs as

Bensonhurst,

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,030
and Brighton beach.

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,110
He also has extensive properties in the
Queens neighborhoods of Coney islands

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,490
and Jamaica estates.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,890
In addition to his
residential housing portfolio,

31
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,120

00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:37,440
builds on the concepts of save yourself
and save with war on the horizon.

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,440
He also got into construction
on military basis.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,310
Donald's mother,

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,091

Trump was at Scottish heritage.

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,920
She met frank in the early
1930 [inaudible] as a teenager
when they were married

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,860
in 1936 she was just 24 years old.

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,620
They settled into a 23
room house in Queens.

42
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,680
Vows was extravagance
with a colonial style,

43
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,100
portico,

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,760
frame entrance and six
imposing white marble pillars.

45
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,380
Freds two Cadillac's FCT one and
FCT too well parked in the driveway.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,981
The trumps,

47
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:08,040
well one of the few families have an
intercom system installed in their home,

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,620
not to mention a chauffeur
and a personal butler.

49
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,220
Mrs. Trump was also a philanthropist
who became passionately involved in a

50
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,260
number of causes that
were close to her heart.

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,280
She was the main driving force of the
ladies helper of Jamaica facility as well

52
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,960
as the Jamaica daycare nursery.

53
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,250
Mary was also an ardent supporter of the
national kidney establishments if New

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,910
York and the group mainstreaming
partners of incredible neck New York,

55
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:32,970
which provided help for people who
were crippled of all of his children.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,540
Young Donald showed the most interest
in his father's business ventures as a

57
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,140
result of Fred would sometimes take the
boy onto construction sites with him as

58
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,790
he developed his own personality.

59
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,160
Donald's gains a bit of
a reputation as a bully.

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,400
There's parents were lacks in
imposing discipline upon him.

61
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,383
On one occasion,

62
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,010
the trumps neighbor Martha Burnham,

63
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,550
came home to find the four year old
Donald throwing stones at our son.

64
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,210
Dennis.

65
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,990
Donald had apparently targeted
dentists as an easy mark for his venom.

66
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,570
Martha warns her son to stay
away from the nasty crump boy.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,250
By the time he was age,

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,580
Donald's was the leader
of a group of young thugs.

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,810
He would ride around
Queens on their bicycles,

70
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,350
anything else,

71
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,010
insults to people and stopping to deal
with other youngsters who they didn't

72
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:12,820
like the look off.

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,270
He was known for saying what's every
one says and acting impulsively.

74
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,290
Fred's enrolled.

75
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,730
Donald's adds a private education
facility in forest hills called Kew forest

76
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,320
school.

77
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,210
Fred to happens to be on the
board of trustees for that school.

78
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,590
This fact seems to have
emboldened Donald's in his
way with behaviors taking the

79
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,680
lead amongst a bunch of boys
who were constant troublemakers.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,291
He would pull,

81
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,910
the girls have purposely bumping into
other students' desks and it's talk out of

82
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,780
turn in class.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,680
Donald's grades,

84
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,180
they were mediocre at best.

85
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,020
This was mainly due though to lack of
application rather than lack of ability,

86
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,780
a situation that has greatly
frustrated as teachers.

87
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,410
However,

88
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,090
on the playgrounds and the sports fields,

89
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,980
he displayed considerable ability.

90
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,840
His favorite gym game was dodgeball.

91
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,800
He displayed great dexterity and avoiding
balls that were thrown at him and he

92
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,890
was often the last man standing outdoors.

93
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,950
He excelled at baseball.

94
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,300
He was a talented player and a fierce
competitor as a sixth grader is batting

95
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:04,720
power.

96
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
Was exceptional when he came up to bat.

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,770
The defending side would
have to extend its field,

98
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:12,520
is way out in order to handle
his daunting right arm swing.

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,290
One morning when he was 12 years old,

100
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,800
Donald and his friend Peter Brands
jumps on the train to Manhattan.

101
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,820
Such an excursion had not been authorized
by Donald's parents getting off at

102
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,990
Fifth Avenue and 53rd they spent the day
scrolling through central park buying

103
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:26,651
curiosity,

104
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,470
is it novelty stores and
wandering among the homeless.

105
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,220
One of the items that Donald
purchased was a switchblade knife.

106
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,790
It was a month later that Fred discovered
the knife and the story of Donald's

107
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,610
unauthorized trip to the
city was uncovered Fred.

108
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,510
He was outraged.

109
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,350
He finally came to the realization
that Donald was out of control and that

110
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,670
something had to be done.

111
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,960
Fred decided that his fourth son was in
dire need of some external discipline.

112
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,590
He enrolled Donald's at the rosy and
military boarding school about 70 miles

113
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,190
away.

114
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,340
There would be no more comfortable living
in the mansion and swelling around the

115
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:57,780
neighborhood.

116
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,890
Mcdonald's and implementing
this new strategy.

117
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,030
Fred acted quickly,

118
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,000
not even giving his son
time to say as fat wells,

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,220
life was indeed vastly different.

120
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,030
At the military school,

121
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,780
the boys were required to wear a uniform
that consisted of a thick fleece,

122
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:19,980
pullover and pants and alarm woke them
up early in the morning and their entire

123
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,600
day was regulated by the clock.

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,280
Donald's life was now completely
controlled by Theodore
had Tobias the hands on

125
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,390
school administrator.

126
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,490
Tobias was a no nonsense World War II
veteran who demanded excellence from his

127
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:33,300
new recruits.

128
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,600
He knew that many of the boys that were
sent to him with that to be toughened up

129
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,790
and to have discipline imposed upon them,

130
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,400
and he took that
responsibility very seriously.

131
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
As you might imagine,

132
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:45,060
all of this was a pretty
serious shock for Donald's.

133
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,870
His initial reaction was resentments
and is a natural tendency to buck the

134
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:49,470
system.

135
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,720
He seemed racked up a number of charges,

136
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:54,840
including not making as bad and
not properly cleaning the sink.

137
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,320
Yes,

138
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,020
administrative.

139
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,400
Tobias saw something
else in the young Trump.

140
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,080
The boy was incredibly driven and
always had a desire to be number one,

141
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,710
realizing the bucking the system was
only going to get him in deeper trouble.

142
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,140
Don't always began trying
to follow the rules.

143
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,920
The biggest improvement was with regard
to his personal orderliness and won

144
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,170
awards for the cleanliness
of his personal area.

145
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,680
Indeed,

146
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,680
his orderliness bordered on
the obsessive winning him,

147
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,270
the nickname Mr fastidious,

148
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,580
Donald's loud mouth Busta quieten down.

149
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,770
As discipline was injected into a system,

150
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,310
he became soft spoken and had
an air of self confidence.

151
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,040
He developed friendships despite often
being regarded as a bit cocky and

152
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,130
bragging too much about
his father's wealth.

153
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,480
Then during his senior year,

154
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,430
Donald was made a company captain.

155
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,280
This puts him in a position that
have oversight over younger boys.

156
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,970
He inspected that personal space and was
responsible for generally keeping them

157
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,480
in order.

158
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,080
His reputation was such that he very
rarely had to raise his voice at his

159
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:48,800
charges.

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,600
A simple step sometimes accompanied by a
raised eyebrow was enough to impart his

161
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,100
displeasure in his position.

162
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,760
His company caps in Trump proved
himself to be an effective delegator.

163
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,360
This develops to the extent that he would
give the job of inspection of the boys

164
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,230
under his commands to others while he
returned to his room to recline on his

165
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:06,740
bed.

166
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,980
This practice soon came to the
attention of administrative Tobias,

167
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,320
who was less than impressed.

168
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,070
He removed to Trump from his role as
company caps in and gave him a school

169
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,840
administrative position in stat.

170
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,220
Donald's then runs onto frame this as
a promotion for his stellar job in his

171
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:23,120
previous role.

172
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,980
So following his graduation from racier
at the age of 18 he enrolled at Fordham

173
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,780
University in the Bronx
to study real estate.

174
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,010
He was determined to follow in his
father's footsteps and enter the world of

175
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,120
real estate developments.

176
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,661
Of course,

177
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,800
he was going to do it bigger and better
than his old men and to do that if

178
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,410
figured he needed a real estate degree.

179
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,080
In 1966 after two years at Fordham,

180
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:48,260
Donald transferred to the University
of Wharton Business College.

181
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,710
Here he was out of place while
coming from a background of money,

182
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,290
he didn't have the Ivy
League breeding of those.

183
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,310
He rubbed shoulders with.

184
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,970
He was rough and obtuse and soon proved
himself to be the proverbial round hole

185
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,000
in a landscape of square pegs.

186
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,080
On his first day,

187
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,550
the lecturer asked why every student there
had decided to study real estate when

188
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,510
it came to his turn.

189
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,230
Donald stood up and declared that he
was going to become the king of New York

190
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,540
City when it came to
the real estate business

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,051
drum.

192
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:24,310
Graduated from Wharton in 1968 returning
to New York with a degree in real

193
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:24,850
estate.

194
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,421
At this time,

195
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,690
he was eligible for the draft
to serve his country in Vietnam.

196
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,231
However,

197
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:29,471
race,

198
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:30,700
September,

199
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,870
1968 physical exam resulted in a medical
suspension due to bone goads in his

200
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:35,560
heels,

201
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,570
setting himself up in
an apartment in Queens.

202
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,800
Trump began working for his father
in early 1969 from very start,

203
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:46,000
he fells deep seated need to prove
to his father that he was a supremely

204
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,440
talented real estate man.

205
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,990
The Trump way of doing business
was called into question.

206
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,910
In 1973 when a handful of tenants took
up a class action lawsuits against the

207
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,520
company claiming racial discrimination
in violation of the Fair Housing Act.

208
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,470
The case was as impossible to prove.

209
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,010
However,

210
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,880
and the Trump organization paid a small
settlements without any admission of

211
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:06,480
guilt.

212
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,860
Around this same time,

213
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,390
Donald was promoted to president of the
company and his first act was to re name

214
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:12,990
the company.

215
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,350
The format Elizabeth Trump and
son became the Trump organization.

216
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,950
One of his next moves was to hire
aggressive attorney Roy Cohn.

217
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,370
Cohn had a reputation as a bulldog,

218
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,830
Goliath.

219
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,030
If anyone dad's a farmer,

220
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,770
suits against those who he works for,

221
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,930
he would go out and destroy them.

222
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,520
In 1975 Donald's,

223
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:29,760
Matt,

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Ivana,

225
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,500
Maria is they'll niche Guevara.

226
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,590
She was a beautiful sports scare who
hails from Czechoslovakia or Romans.

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,421
Seen Blossoms,

228
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,010
ends after a two year courtship.

229
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,050
The couple were married
over the next five years.

230
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,740
Ivana was given management responsibility
and a number of business ventures.

231
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,660
She also bore Trump three children,

232
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,880
Donald jr Ivanka and Eric.

233
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,950
The vast majority of Fred Trump's business
was centered on middle income housing

234
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:57,520
in Brooklyn,

235
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,770
queens and Staten Island's to Donald's.

236
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,940
This was small time.

237
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,140
He wanted to break into the large scale
commercial real estate and the heart of

238
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:05,920
the big apple.

239
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,770
He's had his sights on
a project in Manhattan.

240
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,990
His target was the Commodore Hotel.

241
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,830
The commodore was a derelict to
2003 white elephants on 42nd street.

242
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,000
Trump intend to do completely remodel
this into an upmarket Hyatt hotel.

243
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,430
The highest end buyer was
run by the Pritzker family.

244
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,770
Despite having presences
all over the states,

245
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,320
they have no representation in New York,

246
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,640
but the area surrounding the commodore
was extremely CD and the Pritzkers were

247
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,400
in need of some serious
convincing for Donald.

248
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,940
However,

249
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,510
the CD environments and the decrepit
state of the hotel meant that he would be

250
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:41,320
able to pick up the property at a
steal of a price to make the purchase.

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,800
However,

252
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,900
he would need to borrow a lot of money.

253
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,910
The finance was secured by bank loans.

254
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,270
There were underwritten by both Fred
Trump and the highest organisation.

255
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,320
Donald Aussie managed to secure a 40
year tax exemption on the building.

256
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
The renovation of the commodore and its
metamorphosis into the Grand Hyatt hotel

257
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,210
proved to be a great success with Trump
winning accolades from the city fathers

258
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,070
along with an award for the tasteful and
creative recycling of a distinguished

259
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:06,700
hotel.

260
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,300
The grand science projects coupled with
the reflected reputation of his father,

261
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,440
established Donald's as a legitimate
player in the New York commercial real

262
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,274
estate markets.

263
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,590
Sure.

264
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:20,860
Shortly

265
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,660
after the completion of
the highest projects,

266
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,100
Trump began negotiations to develop
a 58 story building on Fifth Avenue

267
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,340
adjacents to famous New York
landmark Tiffany and company.

268
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,440
This $200 million developments
was to be Trump's masterpiece.

269
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,100
It would feature a six story atrium
that was lined with pink marble as an 80

270
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,180
foot waterfall.

271
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,550
Depends.

272
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,470
House was to be Donald's personal living
quarters with this officer's just below

273
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,040
the first couple of floors would then
feature some of the world's most famous

274
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:48,874
retailers.

275
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,630
The building opens in 1983
and was named Trump tower.

276
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,680
It's received international attention
and was attended by a number of

277
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,890
celebrities at the same time that
Donald was working on Trump tower.

278
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,210
A local New York buildup was attempting
to repair derelict Wollman skating rink

279
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,680
after two and a half months.

280
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,210
The work that style matters,

281
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,020
there was a lot of public dissatisfaction
that the ring was not reopened on

282
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,470
time.

283
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,040
Then Donald interjected himself into the
whole affair when he wrote a letter to

284
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,970
the mayor stating that
he could supercharge the
projects and just bring it in.

285
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,260
Well under budget.

286
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,420
The mayor responded by calling his bluff.

287
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,990
Donald went straight to a concrete that
he had a working relationship with.

288
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,620
He convinced them to take the Wollman
rink projects on the for free with a

289
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:33,370
guarantee that the publicity it would
bring would far outweigh the costs

290
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,060
involved.

291
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,990
The projects when's ahead on that basis
and was completed under time and under

292
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,900
budget by three quarters
of a million dollars.

293
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,430
The publicity ans public appreciation
that the woman rig project brought in was

294
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,120
huge,

295
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,640
but it was all directed
towards Donald Trump.

296
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,430
The contractor who had done the
heavy work without payments,

297
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,990
barely even got him mentioned.

298
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,660
1980 you saw Trump moving
into the gambling business.

299
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,230
He acquired all of the necessary
licenses and then purchased a property in

300
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,180
Atlantic city to do this project.

301
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,870
He partners with the Holiday Inn
cooperation the parent's company of harass

302
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:11,704
casinos.

303
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,940
In 1984 the facility opens
as Porras at Trump plaza.

304
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,890
The casino was a great success.

305
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,390
Wetting Trump's appetite for more.

306
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,020
He actively sought out casinos
that had failed gambling licenses.

307
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Finding one in the form
of the Atlantic City,

308
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,350
Hilton Hotels Casino.

309
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,530
He acquired the property spending $310
million on the purchase and upgrade it

310
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,830
later reopened as Trump castle
always wanting to go one better.

311
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,220
Trump took over developments of the
largest casino in the world at the time,

312
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,570
the Taj Mahal,

313
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,330
the Trump Taj Mahal opens in 1990 however,

314
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,170
Trump had to go into extreme
debt in order to open the doors.

315
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Revenues would have to average $1
million per day in order to cover costs.

316
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,870
This was simply an unheard of number and
the reality was that it was never going

317
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:56,500
to happen.

318
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,280
Trump indeed had to go through major
bankruptcy restructuring in order to keep

319
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,180
the casino going.

320
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,570
Eventually ending up with
just a 10% ownership stake.

321
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
Around this same time,

322
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:08,710
Trump also established Trump's
hotels and casino resorts,

323
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:12,620
which became a publicly traded company
throughout the 1980s and nineties

324
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,120
nineties from never let up on
his real estate developments.

325
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,920
Despite his financial problems.

326
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,960
In 1985 he purchased a 76 acres of
western Manhattan in order to create a

327
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,430
television city complex.

328
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Then in 1988 he purchased the
Plaza Hotel for $407 million.

329
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,590
Then 1989 saw his first
investment in Florida.

330
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,370
By this time,

331
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,310
he had also acquired a number of
golf results across the country.

332
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,790
In 1992 Trump hit the headlines
for all the wrong reasons.

333
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,630
When his affair with a 23 year old
actress named Marla Maples was exposed.

334
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,030
Display Room is if on,

335
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,140
I refuse to believe truth until Marla
followed the trumps on a skiing trip and

336
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:58,040
confronted Ivana with the news that
Donald was in love with her and that Ivana

337
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,970
best give up on him.

338
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,740
This was too much for Ivana.

339
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,820
She filed for divorce,

340
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,440
leaving maples free to marry Donald's,

341
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,560
which he did in 1993 they had one child
together who they named Tiffany after

342
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,100
the famous New York department store.

343
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,761
The marriage,

344
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:14,990
though it was rocky from the start
and end in divorce in 1999 ironically,

345
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,860
the proceedings were instigated by
Donald's when he learns that his wife was

346
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:19,694
having an affair.

347
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,450
Donald was then associated with a number
of women in the early two thousands

348
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,220
back in 1998 he had met a Slovenian
but by the name of Melania conops.

349
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,480
Over the next few years,

350
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:33,260
that relationship develops at the points
where Melania became Donald's constant

351
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:33,860
companion.

352
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,860
They were engaged in 2004 and married
on January the 22nd 2005 and Palm Beach,

353
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:40,010
Florida.

354
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:40,461
The couples.

355
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,480
Only child baron.

356
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:46,481
William Trump was born on March the
20th 2006 on October the 21st at Trump

357
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:46,821
hotels,

358
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,360
casinos and resorts restructured its
death resulting in Trump's ownership.

359
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:55,361
If the company dropping from 59 to 27%
the company applied for bankruptcy.

360
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,340
It reemerged as Trump
entertainment resorts holdings.

361
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,570
Trump now put a premium on pushing his
brands with the Trump logo being placed

362
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,040
on all manner of products.

363
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,330
Even released his own game.

364
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,550
Donald Trump's real estate tycoon,

365
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,780
Trump's political views,

366
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,980
they've undergone a metamorphosis
over the years up in Zillow.

367
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,700
1987 he was a democrat.

368
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,210
However,

369
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,691
in that year,

370
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:18,290
he registered for the first time as a
republican toying with the idea of running

371
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:18,860
for office.

372
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,130
He placed full page ads in three
papers espousing his views,

373
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,450
which were that America,

374
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,100
and you'd have to stop propping up other
countries and start looking after it.

375
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:27,830
Same people.

376
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,090
In October of 1999 Trump established
and exploratory panel to assess the

377
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,480
viability of his running for the reform
party's candidate for president from

378
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,170
nominee in two thousands it was decided
that his lack of profile on the west

379
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,240
coast would be too much of a detriment.

380
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,450
This led him to pass on the
opportunity from that point onwards.

381
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:44,960
However,

382
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,830
he bided his time and it's increasingly
made political comment for public

383
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:49,664
consumption.

384
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,500
In 2003 Trump ventured into the world
of reality television when he became the

385
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,410
executive producer and
star of the apprentice.

386
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,580
The show in which contenders go through
a series of challenges do you when a job

387
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:09,280
has Trump's apprentice was a huge success.

388
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,390
It propelled Donald Trump to worldwide
recognition status in one and a star on

389
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:17,770
the Hollywood walk of fame from reentered
the political arena in 2001 when he

390
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:21,490
raised questions about the legitimacy
of President Barack Obama's birth

391
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,090
certificates.

392
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,830
He doggedly held to this view despite
Obama's insistence that he was born on us

393
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:27,340
soil.

394
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,990
He's serious and he considered running
for the top office again in 2012 but

395
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,550
again decided that the time wasn't right.

396
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,380
Then on June the 16th 2015 he famously
announced from Trump plaza that he would

397
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:42,130
be throwing his hat into the ring for the
Republican nomination for president in

398
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:47,131
2016 few people to come seriously but
serious he was and history will record him

399
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,200
for better or as the 45th
president of the United States.

400
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,990
