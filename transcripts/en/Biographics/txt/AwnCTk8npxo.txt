The story of Dwayne Johnson, the rock is a tale of dedication, gris and old fashioned hard work. In this week's biographics, we chart the rise and the rise of 2016, the sexiest man alive. Dwayne Johnson,

Speaker 1:          00:49          Wayne Douglas Johnson was born on May, the second 19, 72 in Haywood county, California. His mother after was Samoan origin while his father wade was a black Nova Scotian Wade's ends living as a professional wrestler under the name of Rocky Johnson. To further entrenched the wrestling gene in his blood. Dwayne's maternal grandfather also had been a professional wrestler, promoted as high chief Peter Maivia. He was the first simone wrestler to break into the big time. A generation later rocky became the first black champions who conquered the state wrestling scene. Rocky hustled as a wrestler taking on bouts web ever. He could in order to support his family, times were tough with the family moving from state to state in order to keep pace with the wrestling venues. In fact, during Dwayne's formative years, the family of three lived in 38 of the 50 states as they became entrenched in the gypsy wrestling lifestyle.

Speaker 1:          01:41          The only time Dwayne got to see his dad was when he went on the road with him. He cherished these times and quickly fell in love with everything to do with professional wrestling. His Dad taught him some basic moves, including the sleeper hold when he was 11. Dwayne was playing wrestling one school, lunchtime. When you put the, uh, hold on a classmate, the kids immediately parsed out. Unfortunately, rocky had him showing his son how to bring someone out of the sleeper hold. The ambulance and the police were called and rocky has to come down to revive the students. The Johnson House became a hangouts for Dwayne. Schoolmates knew that they were going to have to do several rounds with their host. Dwayne would turn these events into mock TV shows where he would pretend to interview the restless. He would even interview himself as he portrayed the bad guy.

Speaker 1:          02:22          His chairmanship was immediately evidence as he came out with all sorts of outrageous pronouncements against his intended victims do. I excelled in a number of sports physically. He was miles ahead of his classmates. He had his first weight workouts when he was 13. He had been tagging along with his down to the gym since he was five years old, as he sounds quietly on a bench and watched proudly as rocky pounded out pset after pset with Gargantuan weights. Dwayne breathed in the gym atmosphere and marveled at the sight of huge men doing seemingly impossible things with massive loads of iron. While other deans took their kids to the playgrounds at rocky, took Dwayne to most of the hardcore gyms in the country. It was here that the future superstar learns that there was no replacement for pure gut wrenching hard work.

Speaker 1:          03:16          At the age of age, rocky allowed Dwayne to participate in sports. He tried baseball, soccer, martial arts, and gymnastics. What he really longed to do is lift weights, but it'd have to wait a few more years to get into that. Finally, on his 13th birthday, his dad took him to a local gym for his first ever weights workouts and obvious place to start was the bench press, which had studied for years as his dad's. Now this Preston, massive amounts of steel from their chest. Rocky had his son start with an unloaded bb. He pumped out 10 reps with no problem, so rocky added a 20 lbs plates to eat. Jens. This time dwayne pushed out eight easy wraps, impressed, rocky, asked his son if he wanted to try the 45 pounders. Dwayne nodded his head, his dad stood behind him and lifted the bar off the supports, and Dwayne got buried under the 135 pound weight.

Speaker 1:          04:03          He felt embarrassed and ashamed as if he had let his dad down. That feeling fueled and intense desire to get better at the bench press. And within a few years he would be benching 400 pounds between the ages of 14 and 15. Dwayne excelled in the gym. By the time you entered high school, he had grown it to a towering six foot three inches and tip the scale at 225 pounds is imposing physicality, gave him a great deal of self confidence, which sometimes bordering on arrogance, but his unstable home life that of his father constantly traveling, left him directionless when he wasn't pounding the weights. As a result of this, he started to get into trouble. It came to a head when he was 15 and he got arrested for check fraud. His parents had to come and collect them from the police station when he looked at his mother and father and he realized that despite living from paycheck to paycheck, he was the biggest source of stress in their lives.

Speaker 1:          04:53          In that moment, he vowed that he would never cause problem for his parents again. Although that was the last time that Dwayne got arrested. It wasn't the last time he caused worry for rocky and data and facts of that very next day at school. He goes into a fight and it's knocks the other kid out. It sounds in a two week suspension. Upon returning to school, he decided that the students bathrooms was not good enough for him and so we decided to use the teachers. One when asked to leave, he was rude to the teacher and trying to intimidate him with his physical presence. That Nice Dwayne felt pangs of guilt at the way he had treated the teacher, so the next day he marched into the deepest class and holding out his hand, said that he wanted to apologize for the way he had acted. The day before the teacher stared at Dwayne's hand for a moment and then grabs this and told Wayne that he appreciated the apology then still holding the boy's hand and he said, I want you to play football for me.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Football proof to be a positive outlet for Dwayne's frustrations and aggressions. Providing him with a renewed sense of focus under the eye of coach Judy Swick. He steadily improved both as students and as an athlete, but at the time he was a high school senior. He was ranked as one of the top 10 defensive tackles in the country and it was offered a scholarship to the University of Miami. The number one college team in the United States that Miami Dwayne's combination of size, strength, and athleticism coupled with his strong work ethic, makes him a standout from the very beginning. Practice was going great and he was primed to be the only freshman on the varsity team, but then tragedy struck on the last day of practice with pads. He crushed the grounds with his full weight on his shoulder. It was dislocated and the number of ligaments were torn that night. He had reconstructive surgery and was told that it need a year to recover.

Speaker 1:          06:40          He was not able to play before the season had even begun. Dwayne, he fell into a deep depression and not even bothering to go to class. Then without even attempting and eve as midterms. He hopped on a flight and returned home, which at that time was in Tampa, Florida. After a couple of weeks, he got a call from Miami's head coach, Dennis Erickson. He told Duane that he wants to be back at school in two days because he wants you to talk to him when they mess up. Erickson was furious with Johnson. He told him that he had embarrassed himself and the team Erickson had trusted him with a position of responsibility and leadership and he had completely let him down. Ericsson then placed Dwayne onto academic probation. He was to attend every class, every practice, and every game simply sitting on the sideline. However, to get it into daily practice, he had to get the signatures of every one of his professors attesting that he had been to class that day.

Speaker 1:          07:27          If he didn't, he would lose his scholarship. Dwayne dug deep and did what had to be done. He eventually became academic captain in his junior year and was preseason all American. He graduated from Miami University in Nineteen Ninety five with a bachelor of general studies and criminology and physiology. It was at the University of Miami that Dwayne first met Danny Garcia, his future wife. They were married in 1997 and divorced 10 years later. After a years injury recovery, Dwayne wasn't quite as fast or mobile as he was on the football field. He was taken from the team and replaced by Warren Sapp after graduation from Miami. Dwayne, when to Calgary. Canada is a practice squad player for the stampeders. Things were tough am in Canada. You had hardly any money and very few prospects, but things got worse when he was cut from the stampede. A squad after just two months

Speaker 1:          08:24          arriving back at his parents' tiny apartments in Tampa, Dwayne was now at rock bottom. It his football career, whereas effectively over at do, you needed to look in another direction. He thought deeply and realized that his life and his passion had always been professional wrestling. If he never turned his hand to it, he would ever be unfulfilled and if he was going to step into that wells, well now is the time. His mother runs. Girlfriends encouraged him to go for it, but Dwayne's dad had major reservations. Rocky knew firsthand just how tough the life of wrestler was and he wanted more for his son, but he vowed to stands behind his son. So long as he put in 110 percent effort into becoming successful. Rocky now became Dwayne's fulltime wrestling coach. From the start though, he talks him much more than simple wrestling moves. He taught him how to be a showman.

Speaker 1:          09:10          After a few months of intensive work, rocky felt his son was ready to take the next step. He goes in touch with a former wrestler named Pat Patterson, who was now a talent agents. Patterson came to check out what's Dwayne looks like in the ring, impressed. He arranged for a signing with the wwe. Dwayne was put into the minor leagues and it was given the name rocky Maivia in homage to both his father and his grandfather. He started wrestling and smaller arenas for $20 a pop, but it didn't take long before he got his break. The 1996 wwe survivor series was televised live on tv from Madison Square Garden and to the new kids on the block was rocky Maivia. He made an immediate impression establishing himself as a rising wwe star by becoming the last man standing. Rocky took on a charismatic in your face persona, which proved to be too loud and too arrogant for many diehard wwe fans.

Speaker 1:          10:00          His character was rejected for being too tacky and fans came to see rocky Maivia as an extremely unlikable character. When he wrestled, the stadium would be listed with signs, reading rocky socks and a die rocky die, but his perseverance and the constant refining of his character. Eventually one of the fans over fans getting to appreciate the much of rocky's narcissism, was tongue in cheek, much in the mold of Muhammad Ali, and they began to enjoy his over the top sense of humor when he shortened his name to with the rock. Fans embraced this, and within a year he had transformed the wrestler. Everyone loves to hate to the People's champ
