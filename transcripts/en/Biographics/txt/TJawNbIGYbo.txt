Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is made possible by brilliance. You're going to learn more about brilliant later in today's video, but if you'd like to get started right now, get a brilliant.org forward slash. Biographics you'll also find a link in the description below. Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as one of the greatest scientists who ever lived. His breakthrough idea about motion influenced every area of physics, allowing other great thinkers to stand on his shoulders, yet news and was also a man at odds with his public perception, a secret our chemist and a heretic who risked his life to write about the feelings of the Anglican Church in today's biographics. We're uncovering the truth about the real Isaac Newton.

Speaker 2:          00:49          Hm Isaac Newton

Speaker 1:          00:51          was born on January the fourth 1643 and will's thought, but by cost or worth the small town in the country of Lincoln, Sharon England's, he was a premature baby who was so small that his mother said that he would have fit inside a quarter mark with room to spare. The doctor who delivered him didn't think that he'd survive his first week. Newton's father who was also named Isaac, had died three months before the child was born. He had been a successful farmer and his wife Hannah was left a financially comfortable widow for the next three years. She raised young Isaac alone. Then in 1646 she remarried to becoming Mrs Barnabas Smith. The relationship between young eyes, I could just step father. It was a difficult one and the boys spends lots of time in the care of his grandmother, Hannah and Barnabas went on. So you have three children together.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Benjamin, Mary and Hannah. Isaac seems to have gotten on well with his half siblings though his relationship with his mother was tempestuous when he was 19 Isaac wrote a list of sins for which he wanted to repent. One of them was threatening to burn down his family home with his mother and stepfather and cite it Isaac and did a village school sporadically, but we didn't begin as formal schooling until the age of 12 when he enrolled at King's school. Then grounds and England's initially he showed little interest in his studies and it's performed poorly in all subjects. However, all of a sergeant, he had something of an attitude change and he decided to apply himself more seriously. When he was 17 Isaac stepfather died. There's another looking to a oldest sons potential. As the family breadwinner attempted to make a farmer out of him. This Isaac had no intention of becoming a farmer. In fact, he detested the very thought of spending his life out in the fields. Unfortunately, after a few months, that master at King's school interceded on Isaac's behalf, convincing Anna it was best suited back with them. Isaac had been bullied by another students chose to response by hour to doing the bully and his cronies. Academically, Isaac achieved outstanding academic results. He was the top performing students of 1660 displaying and amazing aptitude for all subjects.

Speaker 1:          02:56          In June of 1661 Isaac began studying at Trinity College at Cambridge University in order to pay for his studies. He worked out one side of his study hours serving meals and running errands for his professors. The 18 year olds it enter trinity with the goal of becoming a minister of the Church of England's. However, at some point within that first year he changed direction. It is unclear why he decided not to pursue a life in the church, but from his later writings it was clear that he was forming beliefs about gone the work rather at odds with the doctrine of the Anglican church. The foundation of the education that Newton was receiving at Trinity College was based on the teachings of Aristotle. He was fascinated with these ideas. This objects, it's many of the concepts sweat, not based on evidence but merely on the great philosophers assumptions and his ideas. Using the became increasingly focused on the natural sciences as well as philosophy.

Speaker 1:          03:50          He studied the works of such original thinkers as day car Kaplow and Galileo because the establishment have not accepted the scientific findings of these men. Isaac did a lot of his study outside of the classroom using an exorbitant scientific ideas from wherever you could get them. So long as he was able to test and prove them, he would take these ideas on board and then debate them with his professors and fellow students. In 1662 Newton filled the pages of a notebook with a list of 45 things he wanted to study. They came under the general heading of physics, but unlike everyone else who had gone before him, nuisance didn't just pose the questions. He also set out to answer them. He began to divide these experiments in order to find the answers that he was looking for.

Speaker 1:          04:38          The following year, however, Newton's the focus was pulled away from his list of physics based questions. He became fascinated with the works of rainy day Carson. This led him to an in depth study of mathematics. They call it applied to the Arabic discipline of Algebra two geometry and called it Algebraic geometry. Using graduated from Trinity College in August of 1665 he did not receive the stellar grades that his talents mirrors said, which was probably due to the fact that he spent so much time on his own personal studies. At this time, all of Europe, it was being ravaged. The bonding the bubonic plague in London, one in every four people died. Colleges were closed down in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. This bespoke ones, Newton's continued formal education, but he made great use of the time for the next two years. Isaac focused on his personal studies from his family.

Speaker 1:          05:26          Home is the main areas of study where calculus, lunar motion, and optics. He know at the time to mull over all of the knowledge that he had accumulated at Cambridge. It's relate this to the world around him. This led them to more questions. Three of the most fundamental of which were why do things always fall down? Why doesn't the moon fall to earth and why the planets stay in orbit? Newton was convinced the mathematics would lead to the answers to these questions. He developed a new form of maths, which he called flux is the basis of modern day. He knows you wrote about this time in his life. At this time, I was in the prime of my age of invention, men's minded, mathematics and philosophy. More than anytime since using re-sentence Duke Cambridge in the spring of 1667 he had developed into a role the acuity of 23 year old man.

Speaker 1:          06:13          He was a loner with no friends. He was content to spend hours on ends just with his thoughts. Many people dismissed him as just being an absent minded recluse, none of his contemporaries that any idea that he was grappling with an understanding of punditry motion. He took up a position as a fellow of the college and held a number of prestigious positions over the coming years. In 1669 Isaac published his first work, which was called analysis by infinite series. It was an investigation of cubic equations and comes in three dimensions and was well received and the wider scientific community. As a fellow of Cambridge, Newton was expected to become an ordained priest in the Anglican church, but his opposition to the belief in the Trinity Doctrine held him back when he was appointed as Lucchese and professor of mathematics at the college officials pressed for his ordained ship. He managed to pull it off the requirements and he received the promotion.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Now Age 27 years in hell is one of the most prestigious positions in the mathematical world. As an occasion professor, he was required to lecture on mathematics and place copies of his moods in the university library, a requirement's, which he rarely complied with. He began lecturing on the subject of optics with his notes forming the basis of his book optics. His work on optics led Newton to focus on improving the working of the refracting telescope. He was grappling with the problem of how to get the different colors of light to come into focus at the same spot on the lens. He failed to solve this issue and so turned his attention to the reflecting telescope. In 1668 Newton produced the first working reflective telescope, a building on the work of Scottish mathematician, James Gregory. He used his telescope to look into the night sky where he was able to observe the four means of the planet Jupiter.

Speaker 2:          08:02          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          08:06          In 1671 using was nominated as a member of the British Royal Society to support this proposed candidacy. He wrote a letter on the nature of light, which was red at the society's next meeting. It calls mixed reactions with some praising his observation and others vehemently opposed to it using was admitted to the Royal Society in 1672 mocking his entry into the legitimate scientific community. Up until then he had done his work in bice elation, but now he was rubbing shoulders with the most prominent scientists in the world. Isaac immediately came to loggerheads with most of the respected members of the royal society. Robert Hook was the curator of experiments for the society. Unlike the quiet, reserved nusend hook was loud and outgoing. He objected to Newton's writings on the nature of lights, which challenged the conventional wisdom over a period of four years, Hook road 10 published objections to Newton's ideas, each of which were counted by Isaac. Use it in the heat of the constant quarreling, which was a part and parcel of being a member of the royal society. And it's after 15 months he quit the organization, the secretary of the society, Henry Oldenburg, pleaded with him to stay assuring him that he was greatly respected. But Newton stayed away from the society for the next two years.

Speaker 3:          09:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:22          By 1675 newtons, refusal to take the priesthood was becoming a serious problem. There was becoming a talking points which was proving embarrassing to the college with it looking as if he would lose his position. He turned to his men Zuarin's, former Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow for help. Barry suggested that he rides a King Charles the second and request a special dispensation allowing him to continue in his position without entering the priesthood. Using was generally dissatisfied with the way that the Anglican church or devolved is maintained or any of the trappings of the Catholic Church, which he objected to. But his biggest problem was with the doctrine of the trinity. He could not accept that God and Jesus will one in March of 1675 and years and traveled to London to file for a special dispensation. So it's really fun. Surprise. It was granted without question. In fact, the king removed the priesthood requirements for all future new occasion professorships in November of 60 90 a bright comments appeared over the skies in England.

Speaker 1:          10:17          It was tracks and commented on by the leading scientists, including Newton and a new role society member named Edmund Halley. In 1684 the two men got together to discuss the shape of the orbits of planets. Haney was impressed with Newton's ideas and persuaded him to present his works in written form to the royal society. Now, just before we get into the rest of Newton's life, I do want to take a moment to thank the people who make this video possible and not be brilliant. And I know these mid role ads, they're not great for the story here, but these videos are long, so I hope you appreciate it. I need to have sponsors to make them possible. They're pretty expensive and time consuming to prick juice. Now, brilliance are a learning platform which teaches three something called active learning. I like biographies, which are a nice way to learn about people's lives, like a Newton.

Speaker 1:          10:59          Learning about science, it's a little bit trickier. I don't know if you've ever had to sit down with a science textbook. I have. And you know this shore a lot of moments where it's like, Huh, I didn't really understand what is going on. And then you read it again and you still don't get it. This is passive learning. It's no a brilliance is about brilliance, have active learning and they give you something super short to read. It's really easy and then you can immediately apply that to a problem. You just rinse and repeat that and suddenly you're understanding all sorts of stuff that you didn't think you would be. I've used brilliance and I think you should go try it out just to see how fascinating it is that a complex subject can be grasped quite so easily. Obviously with this biography about Newton, they've got lots of stuff related to what he was up to you.

Speaker 1:          11:39          So nice tie in that you could spoil biographics by going to brilliant.org forward slash buyer graphics. And let's get back to Newton for the next 18 months. Newton was consumed with the rising of his masterwork, which he called Principia Mathematica. He was so absorbed with it. So there's the often neglected to eat or sleep and there's three volume work. He brought together the results of 20 years of study, observation and thinking about nature. He began by laying out a series of definitions that underpinned his thoughts on the natural world. These definitions for such things as inertia matter, mass and momentum. They still stand today with his basis established. He then laid out his three laws of motion, the law of inertia and north acceleration and the law of action and reaction these ins and led to his most groundbreaking idea, the law of universal gravitation, the law of gravitation.

Speaker 1:          12:34          It flew in the face of Aristotle's 2000 year old teaching that the earth operates under one set of rules while the sun, the moon, planets and stars, and they follow different rules according to news and there was one law that governs the motion of everything in the universe. The Principia was presented, the Royal Society in 60 86 roboto can immediately accused Newton of plagiarizing his ideas. Despite this, the volume, it was well received when it was published. A year later, it became an instant masterpiece. The lower of universal gravitation was accepted as the breakthrough that explained everything from the motion of the planets to the tones of the seat. Despite the popular reaction to Principia Newton's ideas, they would not be taught in universities for another 50 years

Speaker 1:          13:23          when he was a students at Cambridge. And using that first come into contact with Alchemy, this Uda signs had its origins in the works of Aristotle who taught. So that all matter was composed of four basic elements, earth, fire and water. By adjusting the proportions of any of these components, it was believed that one thing could be turned into another. Aristotle. Also towards that each of the elements was connected to a human emotion or a characteristic. Newsland was fascinated with these concepts, even though they were completely at odds with the rational evidence based way that he synthesize to scientific ideas from that time owned would see, let us sort of double life where he portrayed himself as the ultimate logical thinker while pursuing Unorthodox alchemist experiments, uh, away from prying eyes. At the same time, he also developed a number of religious views that were decidedly outside of the mainstream. Starting in 1669 Newton built up an extensive library of alchemy related books. He was obsessed with finding universal truth and so alchemy as a means of doing so. He wrote thousands of words of notes on the sub. Jackson's conducted hundreds of experiments has inflammation. It was eventually condensed into a book which equals Clavis.

Speaker 1:          14:38          New Zealand has a deep and abiding interest in religion. Over the course of his life. He wrote more than a million words on the subjects, but very few of them were actually published during his lifetime. Through his studies of the Hebrew language and careful study of the scriptures, he became convinced that modern Christianity was not following the model that had been set out by Jesus. You didn't fundamentally disagreed with the doctrine of the holy trinity at the time. This was a act of heresy punishable by imprisonment or even worse by writing about it. Even if his work was unpublished, he was putting his very life at risk to important works of scriptural interpretation that were published in the century. After his death were observations on the prophecies of Daniel and the apocalypse of some John and the chronology of Angel and kingdoms. Amended Knudsen was fascinated with Solomon's temple believing that the building was a paradigm for the universe and a pattern for the future of the human race.

Speaker 1:          15:33          It was his belief that the architecture of the temple health secrets do uncovering the mysteries of the universe and reveals a future Bible prophecy from his. He gave predictions now the ends of the Catholic Church. The return of Christ wins the Day of Judgment in 1687 using became involved in a conflict between King James the second and Cambridge University. The Benedictine monk has requested a receipt of a master's degree without having to swear an oath of allegiance to the Anglican Church. The monk appealed to the king, issued a mandate stating that the university must admit the man without requiring the oath. Newton came out on behalf of the university and with soon appointed to represent them. At the Commission hearing at Westminster is arguments proved persuasive and the monk was not admitted to the university

Speaker 1:          16:20          in January, 1699 using was elected to public office when he became the university's representative in the convention. Parliaments with his new position came a change in personality. You transformed from an introverted retiring academic to a friendlier, more outgoing public servants. In 1690 newtons suffers a period of depression and mental exhaustion apparently compounded by a dose of influenza. He recovered and Spence the 60 nineties focused on the moon's orbit. His work required the obtain astronomical readings from the first astronomer, Royal John farmstead. That's the two men they did not get on. They quarreled from the very start with the relationship eventually completely breaking down. This meant that Newton was unable to complete his investigation into lunar cycles. In 1696 newtons, salty, higher paying job in the public service. He was awarded the position of warden of the royal mint. This drop required to move to London, which is where he actually lived until his death.

Speaker 1:          17:16          He oversaw the recoiling of old silver and gold coins. He also standardize the weights and composition of coins so that he was able to bring British coinage. A much greater degree of accuracy. Then was seven known before three years into the job. He was promoted to master of the meds the draw, which she held until his death paid around 1500 pounds a year, which was a huge amount for the times in 1703 mucin now the most famous scientist in the land to send it to the presidency of the royal society. He held this position until his death in 1,705 he received a knighthood from Queen Anne. However, his acclaim among the scientific community was strange with an ongoing dispute with gem and polymath Godfrey live in. It's over which of them should get the credit for the invention of calculus. Although New Zealand was the first to develop the basic concepts, live minutes published his work on Calculus before Newton. The issue divided the leading scientists of the time.

Speaker 4:          18:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:13          During the last few decades of his life and you didn't spend a great deal of time revising his most famous work Principia Mathematica. A second edition was published in 1713 with a third and final version appearing in 70 26 he also indulged a passion for Biblical studies spending days on end compiling notes on the history of the ancient Hebrews. It is clear that Newton was keen to insure his legacy lived on beyond this physical years. He sat for a number of portraits and sculptures were cost of him still vote. He professed an outward appearance of humility, making the following statement. I do not know what's I may appear to the world, but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother paddle, Laurie, prettier shell and ordinary. Whilst the Great Ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

Speaker 1:          19:01          The last years of Newton's life was spent with his niece, Kathryn Barton conduit and her husband's in his seventies he began to suffer from breathing problems prompting and moved from London to Kensington where the I was fresher in 1725 at the age of 82 he was confined to his beds with severe lung problems. Coughing fits were constant since he suffered from an uncontrolled bladder. By early 1727 he seemed to have recovered some wash. He actually felt good enough to preside over the Royal Society Meeting on February the 28th but that efforts, it was too much for him. Upon his return home, he was again confined to bed and now early March is doctors diagnosed kidney stone and his condition steadily worsens throughout that month. Dee passed away in the early hours of March, the 31st 1727 using was awarded the great honor of being buried at Westminster Abbey. His funeral service was the most extravagant ever held in England for a natural philosopher. So already hope you enjoyed that video.
