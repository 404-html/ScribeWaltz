Speaker 1:          00:00          Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin and more importantly, it's underlying blockchain technology. No matter what the future price of bitcoin. Maybe the real treasure is blockchain because it's going to change the world as much as the Internet did in the 1990s Satoshi Nakamoto was nominated for the Nobel Prize in economics and he has a multibillionaire and yet no one knows what he actually looks like. He might not even be a single person in the name, may serve as a cover for a group who came together for the sake of starting a digital revolution on today's buying graphics. We're going to go over what we know about this little known figure is what does the theories behind his secret identity.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50          In the 1980s and nineties that closest thing you had to a cool gang of rebellious computer hackers was the cypherpunks. They were computer programmers who were interested in creating absolute privacy in the digital world. They specialized in creating ciphers that were nearly impossible to break into. Many of them were anarchists since Libertarians who believes that everyone should be connected online without government interference. Sadly, as we now know, the Internet is anything but free you from the watchful eyes of the NSA, many of the cypherpunks experiments and in the idea that the internet could be used to send digital money without the use of a middleman. David trauma invented Digi cash in 1989 and he published an academic paper on the subject, another one of the Cypherpunks, Nick Savo created bit gold. All of these, they were close but no cigar. Even though the Cypherpunks had this idea conceived, they couldn't actually come up with a technical way to accomplish a true peer to peer experience.

Speaker 1:          01:45          You see, when you're using the Internet, your depending on your Internet service provider and they need to abide by the laws of each respective country. With apps like paypal and Venmo sending money to your friends, it probably seems like an instant peer to peer experience, at least for you as the customer, but behind the scenes these companies still have to settle bank transactions the old fashioned way. This is three days worth of paperwork through an antiquated and expensive system called swift. If this sounds ridiculous in this day and age, that's because it really is. The global digital banking system has been long do an overhaul. Further. After the 2008 stock market crash the world, it was primed and ready for a financial revolution. In October of 2008 someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a paper called Bitcoin, a peer to peer electronic cash system.

Speaker 1:          02:33          He began to email all the cypherpunks asking if they were willing to help him create his idea of a new system that he called blockchain. This was a computer network that she truly was peer to peer. There would be no fear that your Internet service provider, which shut it down. The blockchain is basically an accounting system that records all transactions on a public ledger. Instead of the U s dollar value would be exchanged in a digital currency called bitcoin. New bitcoins have to be created by mining, which is a process of computers attempting to solve a difficult math problem. Once the cipher is solved, the minor is rewarded with a bitcoin. In the beginning. One bitcoin was only worth fractions of a penny back then and he run of the mill computer you just got from your local best buy could handle mining, bitcoin and anyone could receive and deposit the currency in that digital wallet.

Speaker 1:          03:22          The blockchain itself exists in the cloud, which is a sort of hive minds that does not exist in any physical location. This means that no government in the world is the ability to shut it down because as long as there are minors somewhere out there in the welds you were running the blockchain, bitcoin will continue to exist. Even though it was the solution there had been searching for many of the cypherpunks ignored. Satoshi Nakamoto is ideas. The thing is they weren't kids anymore. They were in their forties and 50s and they'd already tried and failed to make that own digital currencies. The idea of bitcoin. It was so radical that it seems like something out of a science fiction movie, but one could be program are from California named how Finny saw its potential and he was the first best and to take Sitoshi neck Emoto seriously.

Speaker 1:          04:05          He asked to work on the bitcoin project for free and so on January the third 2009 bitcoin was first launched health, any institution knack in America who have never met face to face and they've never spoken over the phone. Now can Mojo left his email address on the big coin website allowing anyone's contact him with any questions that they might have about the project. This led to many, the program is joining in and helping them in the very beginning. This idea of it was only popular to anarchists and Libertarians who had the goal of living their lives free from governmental rule. While they are small in number, this community is incredibly passionate about their philosophies to this very day. They were the first ones do cling on to this bitcoin revolution and as many calls Satoshi Nakamoto hero.

Speaker 3:          04:48          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:51          of course. Once the word got out that bitcoin was a way to transfer money privately, it was almost immediately adopted by criminals and 2011 a website called the Silk Road appeared in a web browser called Tor, which is used to browse the dark web. The founders are in kingpin of the Silk Road, goes by the name of dread pirate Roberts, like the character from the princess bride. You can buy anything on the Silk Road including human slaves and hit orders from assassins. Since most of these transactions, they're all done in bitcoin. In 2013 a 29 year olds man named Ross Albrecht was arrested under suspicion of being the dread pirate Roberts. In 2015 he was convicted of conspiracy to transfer narcotics since, since he was labeled as an evil king. Then he was given not just one but two life sentences plus an additional 40 years without the possibility of parole. The average silkroad drug dealer and he got five to 10 years behind bars.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Most people in the cryptocurrency community believed that old was just a patsy and the real dread pirate Roberts has gotten free. The FBI seized Russell breaks cache of bitcoins and auction them off to the highest bidder while all bricks was in solitary confinement. Someone else logged in to the dread pirate Roberts comes on the Silk Road. Either he had passed the account to another King Ben or they truly did arrest the wrong man, so one's a bit coin that started getting a lot of bad press. The Towson I can moto was very upset to see how his project was being used for evil. The last nine person to have communicated with Sitoshi Nakamoto was Gavin Andresen programmer who looked up to NAC and motor. It was his mentor and hero when the FBI and CIA came looking for Sitoshi Nakamoto. Gavin Andresen agreed to speak with them about bitcoin on the mysterious founders behalf because he wanted to help educate them about water.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Blockchain technology actually is this must have fries and Dac and motor because he pick cut off ties with the rest of the original bitcoin team. Since then, Satoshi Nakamoto is bitcoin public wallet addresses remained untouched even in 2017 when the price balloon to $20,000 per coin. He has never withdrawn his money. He should be one of the richest men in the world's, but he has decided not to spend a penny of it for people who were paying attention to bitcoin since its inception. Many founders that they could turn blockchain technology into an opportunity to make their own businesses. Since the code for blockchain was open source and free for anyone to use, it could be improved and builds upon boy genius. Vitalik. Buterin was just 17 years old when he began to learn how to code blockchain and founds in Bitcoin magazine. He gains a loss of respect from people who were much older than he was and he proposed a new project called ethereum.

Speaker 1:          07:26          This wasn't just another coin to compete with bitcoin there. It was far faster and cheaper runs. People could build their own businesses upon the ethereum platform. These were called ICO or initial coin offerings. Unfortunately though, the vast majority of these crypto currency businesses were and still are total scams, the government's agencies of the world, they suddenly had a whole lot more to worry about than just bitcoin because on educated people around the world started to dump their life savings into fraudulent companies in the hopes that it would be the next bitcoin. At the moment, there are very few alternative coins that are legitimate companies and not simply scamps. At the time. This video was neat. The number two cryptocurrency in the world is riddle. This is because there aren't actual corporation led by the former CEO of AOL, Brad Garlinghouse. They have offices in multiple countries where they have hundreds of employees working to educate major corporations about what blockchain can help them do. They are already working hands in hands with the Federal Reserve and have contracts with over 200 banks who have agreed to use their currency. XRP. You just settled trillions of dollars in bank transactions in the future.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Well, many of the leaders in traditional finance and tacker trying to figure out how to incorporate blockchain in the real wells. There are the purists. You still passionately believe in the anarchist ideals of the cypherpunks and of Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of these original followers were made multimillionaires by their initial investments. While some of these people who are coders who understood the blockchain technology, the majority of them had no background in computer science at all, and we're supporting bitcoin simply for the fact that they believed in its philosophy. [inaudible] Moto. It was never the CEO of bitcoin because it's not even a business entity. He was never trying to be a leader, but the level of reverence that some people have for him has been compared to a cult on multiple occasions without a leader to guide them. Bitcoin believers debate over the question of what would Sitoshi do?

Speaker 1:          09:26          They created an analyze this old emails and his publications. The reddit boards are filled with heated debates trying to interpret Sitoshi as words as if they're their Bible. At this point in time, bitcoin transactions take several hours or even days to go through and they cost roughly $40 in fees per transaction. It's got to the point where it's almost as expensive and as slow as the bolt score banking system. The idea of saying bitcoin will be around forever. It's kind of like saying that dial up internet should still be around to, even though the TAC has been in a serious downward spiral ends, other companies like ripple have drastically improved upon blockchain technology in recent years. Much of the bitcoin community is just in total denial. They continue to have blind faith in the original bitcoin and is in a man or group who isn't even around anymore to give their input.

Speaker 1:          10:13          The original programmer of Bitcoin, how Finny suffered from als, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. If you aren't already aware, this is the same year edge degenerative disease that immobilized Stephen Hawking is where someone's brain is fully functional but they no longer have control over their body. The timeline of how Finney's condition getting worse actually lines up with Satoshi Nakamoto deciding to disappear. Andy Greenberg is senior writer at wired magazine, made the connection and he believed that he had cracked the case. So you went to interview him. At this point, Pal Finney was in a wheelchair and he could no longer speak. He could only answer yes or no questions. Greenburg asked point blank if it's true that he was Sitoshi knack and Moto Finney's eyes. Glistened and amusements anti promptly responded. No. Even though how funny has become a multimillionaire from mining bitcoin in the early days of the projects, no amounts of money, you could save him from the disease, but maybe he could postpone the inevitable on the brink of death.

Speaker 1:          11:08          Funding requested that his body be cryogenically frozen in the hopes that someday he would be unfrozen and give them the cure to als. In 2014 he passed away and his body was transported to a lab in Arizona, just two miles away from health and he's home. The FBI showed up on someone's property with a warrant. They dragged out a mountain with black hair and glasses and the rest of the demo under suspicion of being the mysterious founder of Bitcoin, he insisted over and over that he had no idea what they were talking about is full legal name. Oh, that would be Dorian. Satoshi Nakamoto off to the PAP RNC showed up at his doorstep and he was falsely reported that Dory institution now can moto. It was the true founder of Bitcoin. This sends him into the spotlight of the media and he had to go on record with the Associated Press insisting that he did not have anything to do with the project and that someone had clearly taken.

Speaker 1:          12:01          His name is a pseudonym today. Dorian Nakamoto has been affectionately titled the Fake Satoshi and members of the community actually love him. His face was even turned into a meme. Many people felt sorry that he was dragged into this and even donated bitcoins to him as a sort of sorry for the mix up in 2017 those donations inflated to be worth $273,000 and he quickly cashed out at just the right time. Today, Dorian Nakamoto has actually embraced the community and he now enjoys being a celebrity and taking photos with his fans. Then in 2015 yes, another potential candidates emerged in the media. US authorities raided the home of an Australian man named Dr. Craig, right in 2016 rise agreed to do multiple press interviews claiming that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. When he gave his evidence to journalists, they were satisfied not knowing that he had pulled the equivalent of a technical parlor trick.

Speaker 1:          12:55          Some people will believe, some people weren't. And to tell you the truth, I don't really care. Most people don't know how easy it is to fake this kind of proof on blockchain. So it has been published in multiple venues that here's the real Sitoshi Nakamoto. But after seeing the likes of the BBC and the economist of vouching, Fen, many people in the colors of Satoshi began to believe that their messiah had for a tans and he was back to tell them exactly what to do with that money during a public interview. Boy Genius Vitalik Buterin gave a number of examples of our Craig Wrights could have faked this so-called proof and gave examples of how he should have proven that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto, but he had failed to do so. Boozer and sandy signaling theory. It says that if you have a good way to prove something and do you have a noisy way to do it, then the reason why you picked the noisy way was because you couldn't do the good way in the first place.

Speaker 1:          13:44          Craig Rice is in fact profiting office, sudden claim to fame. He is an outspoken to shame and appearing before crowds making promises about a bitcoin's future. In reality, he has started his own company and to the promises he makes her actually not that impressive where the tech is concerned. He made millions of dollars from investors simply by claiming that he is the real protection Akron Moto in many ways. He seems to be bike the wizard of Oz, but many have not been fooled. In February of 2018 Craig rice with sued for stealing $10 billion of crypto currency assets from his former business fondness. The lawsuit is still ongoing, so at the time we're making this video, we can't be sure of the outcome. The journalist named Andrew O'hagan has done a very deep dive into the Craig right case and here's discovered that Rice also lost a lot of money in the past from a cryptocurrency farm called Liberty Reserve in Costa Rica. Right? Awesome. At face to face with Ross Ulbricht soon before his arrest. So why on earth would this millionaire businessman be associating with a drug dealer from the Silk Road? Some people theorize that, right? Isn't Satoshi Nakamoto at all, and he may actually be the true dread pirate Roberts.

Speaker 1:          14:54          There are dozens of theories of who at Satoshi Nakamoto truly is from Elon Musk to the NSA. One of them asks, former ends ends at Space X. Sahil Gupta wrote a comprehensive blog post on medium as to why he believed that his former boss was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. This caused such a stir that Elon Musk and to tweets that he was not the founder of Bitcoin. Everyone of course, has a very passionate reason for believing that their theory is the correct one, whoever he is, we may never have seen Satoshi Nakamoto in the news at all, even under another name. It's very possible that he knew better than to put himself in the limelight and it would be impossible to gases identity. Effie kept in the shadows, but it's the Toshi neck and moto is still alive and his, if he is true leaf, just one man or even a group of people, why haven't they touched those billions of dollars that are sitting in that big coin wallet?

Speaker 1:          15:42          Is there really a person on this planet with the willpower to resist that kind of temptation and what does he think about the corrupt system that bitcoin has become? In 2012 Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in an email to one of the original core developers of Bitcoin by hand. That ripple is interesting in that it's the only other system that does something with trust beside concentrated into a central server. While she is basically saying is that it's the only other coin he considered a real contender and admits that it's truly an improvement on bitcoin and his last email, he also rode the dude given up on bitcoin and wanted to work on another project without giving any details as to what that new project actually was. And this leads us to our final theory. David Schwartz, who is now the lead cryptographer ripple. In 1988 Shults filed two patents have a distributive computing network before the existence of the Internet.

Speaker 1:          16:34          And in lots of ways his idea, it was almost identical to bitcoin. 20 years before Sitoshi Nakamoto appeared on the scene. Shorts is no stranger to using alias as either, and he went by the pseudonym Joel counts online for many years. There is no denying that he was intelligent enough to come up with this on his own. Shorts is used his knowledge to turn the rep, the ecosystem into a product that is far more sustainable than bitcoin ever was. It doesn't need to be mined. That transactions are settled within a few seconds in each transfer costs a fraction of a penny banks around the world already beginning to use the ripple network because it's the only one that's even remotely possible to use in the real world. David Schwartz has an estimated net worth of $90 million. If ripple succeeds as much as many believe it will and he may become a billionaire at some point in the future.

Speaker 1:          17:19          This would serve as a rational explanation as to why he hasn't touched the fortune in bitcoin is because he doesn't want the possibility that it may lead back to him and he became so rich with ripple that he doesn't actually need it when presented with this theory. David Schwartz denies it of course, but that's probably what the real sitoshi would totally say. So I really hope you found their video interesting and it was a little different from our normal video is here with us not really knowing anything about the man, but they have it. I do hope you enjoyed it. Give it a like if you did leave us a comment. Let me know what your thoughts, if you're looking at something else to check out, why not check out my other channel called top tens you'll find a link to that below this video, and as always, thank you for watching.
