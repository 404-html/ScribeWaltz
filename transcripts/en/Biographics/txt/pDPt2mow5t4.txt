Speaker 1:          00:00          The real life exploits of Liana does have spotter and his 300 warriors at Thermopylae have given rise to the myth of the spot and superhero. These supremely disciplines, man of few words who had a body of steel. It could endure any hardship and would fight to his last breath. It's not Japan really did exist and chief among them was Leon Idus, the spartan king who defined the moat of Persia, saving grease from an isolation. And this week's biographics, we discovered the real life Leon at us

Speaker 1:          00:43          Leona. This was born around 540 BCE and the Greek city of Sparta at that time at Greece was made up of hundreds of city states of which Athens and Sparta with the largest Leona does his father, Alexandra Idis was the king of Sparta for the Greeks, warfare was fie su-preme statements of a citizen. This is what made a man a man and gave him his right to be a part of his city. Every Greek in every city. State was obliged to military service from the age of 20 until the age of 45 in order to prepare for that life, boys were put into a military training camp known as the [inaudible] from the age of seven. There was only one exception to this compulsory military service, the firstborn son of the king of each city state. His upbringing would be focused on grooming him for the power that he would inherit on his father's death, Leon.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It is. However, it was the third son of Alexandra Eddie's his older half brother, kilometers. The first was first in line to be the next king of Sparta. As a result, Liana just spent his formative years learning how to be a spartan warrior between the age of seven and the age of 12 Liana, this underwent a training regimen along with a group of other boys under the supervision of a warden who was called the page and numerous. The literal translation of this is herder of boys. This was a highly respected spot and drawn from the highest social class. Here's all authority, allows him to punish anyone who misbehaved and to this end, he was accompanied by a whip wielding squad of you this who were ready to meet out as punishments as the system was designed to produce effective warriors, great emphasis was placed on a rough and tumble lifestyle.

Speaker 1:          02:17          The boys were divided into bands and they chose as their leader the best fighter. Meanwhile, the predominance would keep a close eye on their antics, meeting out punishment to anyone who got out of line as well as in boy is in the aggregate. We're not permitted to wear shoes. It was believed that leaping, jumping, and running were accomplished more swiftly and barefoot. The boys were also allowed just one cloak throughout the year. This was designed to force them to grow accustomed. Steve Sweltering Summers and freezing winters making do with what little covering they had. Food for the boys was strictly rations on the belief that a lean hungry man fights. It's far more effectively than a fat satiated one. Also being able to go a long time without food, which make for a better prepared. Fifth's was also severely punished unless it involved the stealing of food. The logic behind this was that by at lending to pilfer food, the boys would be practicing the skills of foraging that would be needed when on a military campaign as well as that training to become Boreus.

Speaker 1:          03:13          The bodies were also taught to read and to write. In fact, the Spartans gained a reputation as men of learning who love to music, poetry, and dance. The age of 12 was an important watershed year in the life of a young spartan. He was now placed in a band of about a dozen of his peers in order to live under the headship of one drawn from his ranks. This was the Aaron or prefect. The one chosen was the smartest, the most battle ready and cunning. Though there is no record that Liana just was put in this position, it is quite likely that he being the son of the king and it's given the future battle prowess that he displayed did indeed serve as an Erin during his teen years. The other boys had to give the absolute obedience to him. They were to act as his servants collecting firewood and it's fettering vegetables using their thieving skills.

Speaker 1:          03:59          Also at the age of 12 spartan boys were taken under the wing of an Erastus or admirer to receive a form of mentoring whereas another Grecian city states this relationship was a sexual one. This was not the case in spotter desire for the body rather than the soul of a boy who was considered to be the height of shame. At the age of 18 the Spartan youth became a malaria, a title, which means he is nearly an errand. His military training was now stepped up cause he came close to entering military service. And so already by the age of 20 spots in society has molded me, honored us into an agile battle ready military machine full of self confidence, discipline. And to killer instincts. He was ready to make his mark on the field of battle. Leon Anders had trained to be a hoplite warrior. Cop.

Speaker 1:          04:44          Lights were experts in using the short iron sword and round shield and spear. They fought in a tight phalynx formation in which they would approach the enemy with the shield overhead to form a tortoise like shell in order to defend themselves from oncoming arrows. Just as Liana just was a bouncy, went to military service, news reached him that his father, the king had died. His brother therefore inherited the throne. So while one brother took on the mantle of supreme ruler over the city state, the other inherited the role that he had been given his entire life. That of a spartan warrior. The Spartan army was divided into age groups spanning 10 years within these divisions, and the basic grouping of men was into mass groups of about 15 men. It was with these men that Liana does lived during his twenties it was also around this time that Liana does married the daughter of his half brother. She was named Gorgo and was, by all accounts, a beautiful lens, politically astute woman. After a few years, they had a son who they named Cleon Veritas.

Speaker 1:          05:50          My 490 BC, things were not going well fully on a distance older half brother. Over the last three years, Grecian city had one by one succumbs to the invading Persians. The capitulation of these powers was a source of outer to the proud spot and king, and in 491 the SMT do overthrow a neighboring king. It was about two conceit to the Persians, but when they're kings blands do Alster duly appointed fellow king were revealed the people of Sparta. We're not happy and it's clear. Manez was forced to flee the city. He then set about gathering a formidable army and the surrounding territories wisely. The Spartans allows him to return, but believing that the king had gone insane, hadn't thrown into chains. Apparently this order was carried out on the direction of Lialda spill on his was placed under the gods of the heloc slave class.

Speaker 1:          06:36          The imprisoned king managed to persuade one of his capitalist to lend him his dagger with, as he apparently committed and appalling sort of Harry Carey slicing himself into pieces from his feet with when Claremont has it taken the throne in 30 years. Previously has half-brother Doris who was older than Leon [inaudible], was sense that the throne had passed him by finding it impossible to remain in Sparta. You attempted to establish a colony in Africa when this fails. He went to Sicily where he ultimately met an untimely death and so it was that on the death of clear Mendez in 1490 in Leon at us, it was the next in line for the throne

Speaker 1:          07:19          immediately upon ascending to the throne, Leon and this was thrown into the heat of conflict for years. The Persians had been at threatened in Greece and now the situation was that a critical point, swift action was needed ans neon. It just proved to be the right man to deliver it. The goal of the Persians was the absolute subjugation of Greece. They already ruled over a number of Greek cities on the coast of Asia. The continued existence of other Greek city states was a beacon of light for those already in Gulf to by the Persians, making them dream of independence. This was simply not acceptable to the Persian king, Xerxes to crush old Grecian resistance succes and gathered together a massive force consisting of 1,207 warships and as many as 1.7 million warriors in stark contrast, the Greeks were badly disunited of more than 100 city states.

Speaker 1:          08:08          So neat. 31 had agreed. Do you stand and fight against the Persians? The kings of these 31 states met and swore an oath to fight the Persians and to punish any cities that went over to the Persian side. Still with the key states of facily and by ots supporting Persia, there was no active resistance to the invaders right down to the city of Athens. The Spartans had taken on the mantle of leadership and the resistance. The city was recognized as being in a position of moral, political and above all military preeminence in all of Greece. Under the Oneidas. The Spartans were absolutely determined to fight in order to conquer or die the alliance with other resisting city state so loudly on it as to put around 60,000 men into the fields getting sacked sees of Persia believed that his overwhelming superiority in numbers would guarantee the victory.

Speaker 1:          08:55          It was his strategy to keep his naval fleet and does infantry closely connected. The infantry thus marched along the shore and so the Persians even dug a canal through Mount Athos do allow the ships to stay close. When the army got inland's by August the 18th 480 Xerxes had overrun Macedonia. Vaseline is army now. It arrived at the place they called Thermopylae and narrow pass between facily and the ocean, and the auditors knew that he could never defeat the entire Persian army, but he believed that if he could inflicts a devastating blow of such magnitude that it decimated a portion of that army. The psychological damage would be such that the Persians would withdraw that not everyone was convinced that this strategy would actually work. Not Undermining. The honor does a strategy was the article of Apollo at Delphi. This was a person who was considered to have a hotline to the gods of Greece when the Spartans had approached the article asking whether they should resist the Persians there apply that came back was either the king of Sparta, ms die or the Spartans themselves must be conquered for nothing can stands before the mice of the Persian king.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Each successive city states that approach. The article was likewise given a premonition of doom. Still they honored us, was not deterred. He ends every Spartan Warrior with him would give his last breath to keep the Persians out of their beloved city state they wanted us to do, wants to meet the overwhelming Persian force on the open fields. It was his intention to withdraw to the spot where the Peloponnesian Peninsula joins the lance of Attica. This was a very narrow strip of land, just a mile and a half long. Here. He would set his men to building a defensive wall behinds which they would find sexy says Ami. The bowling with his plan was that it left Athens completely without any protection. So against his better judgments, neon adjusts, agreed to take a small force up to Thermopylae and engage the Persians at the narrowest point of the past. Here, the great advantage of the Persians, the use of cavalry would be negated.

Speaker 1:          10:58          All know, just decided that 300 Spartan warriors would be selected for the defense if the modeling and they would be led by he himself. So the question is now, why would just 300 chosen and why particularly these 301st 300 was a manageable number for an elite task force. Secondly, the figure 300 had a strong symbolic and it's practical overtone in Sparta as it was the fixed number of the regular royal body art. The body guards were known as cavalry men, though they in fact served as infantry men in the dead center of a hoplite Phalynx. This was where the commanding king would be stations. The three injured cavalry men were especially selected in an intense competition. They were selected from the men in the 10 youngest adult citizen year classes age between 20 and 29 Liana just is the moppet. The advanced guard of 300 however, was to be selected with one crucial additional criteria besides being exceptionally brave skill for them.

Speaker 1:          11:52          Patriotic each of the chosen few must have a living son. This would ensure that his son would be in place to carry on his father's name. These as within constitutes an elite within an elite bursting with pride to emulates the feet if they're late fathers. In addition to the 300 Spartans and he honored us, stuck around for thousands Peloponnesians and around a thousands noncombatants ups. It is clear for the firm, obsolete 300 words would be in effect a suicide squad. The parts of the firm opoly has a flat plane in front of us and that was where the Persians were encamped the pass through the mountains to the sea. It was only six feet wide at points at the points where the past wade into 50 feet. The Spartans set about repairing and existing wall and making it a much more defensible location. After Xerxes is vast passion and forces arrived at the past as west, and then a three or four day delay occurred before he launched his assault.

Speaker 1:          12:44          In this pre battle pause, it is reported that Xerxes sends a message to Leon at us. He demanded that he handed over his arms. There's spartan king replied in just two words, Milan Laba, which essentially means come and get them yourself. It was also during this low before the storm that the Persian advanced reconnaissance reported back to Xerxes the strange behavior. They saw it among the Spartans rather than being anxious if the coming attack, the Greek warriors appeared supremely at ease. They busied themselves with bathing, braiding one another's hair and dancing. The Persians interpreted this as signs of fear induced madness until they traitorous Greek in their midst, informed the king that the Spartans were certainly not Matt or the Persian spies had seen where the actions of pound heroes preparing themselves for their final life and death struggle. So the Persian king first sent in the meets a force of about two thousands but these forces proved no match for the Spartans.

Speaker 1:          13:38          They wore near the helmets and all grieves and their shields were made of wicker work in the confined spaces of the past. They were unable to take advantage of their superiority in numbers. When the Medes unleashed a hail of arrows on the defenders in unison, the Spartans lifted their shields over, had to form a defensive roof over their heads. The Medes and the troops that followed them did the best they could under the judgmental. I have their king, but it was not enough and they suffered heavy losses. In fact, losses were so great on three occasions that Zach sees is said to have a laptop in horror from his specially constructed throne appalled at the carnage and Sorta of some of his best men behind the protection of the refurbished wall. Liana does his men resisted by fighting and relates this clever tactic, maximize the efficiency outpost of their limited resources and energies.

Speaker 1:          14:22          Liana does salsa managed to pull off a series of feigned retreats, followed by a sudden about 10 then a murderous onslaught on that overconfidence and distorted Sueess. Eventually towards the end of daylight, Xerxes felt that he had no option but to send in his elite royal bodyguard, the 10,000 immortals under the command of he Diana's bus. Once again, the attack was to no avail and it came at the cost of serious casualties. The goal and bloodshed that in Gorge Dinero Mountain pass was overwhelming. The piles of quickly rotting corpses mounted, the flies swarmed and the stench was palpable. The battle raged into a second day and still is axes was unable to make a breakthrough by now. Some 20,000 Persians had fallen to the Greek resistance and the demoralizing effect on the remains of the Persian army was telling why could they not turn back these few simple rentals.

Speaker 1:          15:23          With his frustration of boiling point, Xerxes finally received his break, not through his military superiority, but by means of a traitor. Xerxes was approached by a Greek term coach by the name of the fallacies from the city of malice. He was very familiar with the paths crossing the mountain range. He told the King of another path through the mountain that would allow the Persians do bypass the Greek defensive position. The Lte is offered to a squat as many as 10,000 Persian trips through that path by night and turn the flank of the Spartans. This Lawson's knew of the existence of this alternative route, but they didn't know that Zach season, you have assets Zach sees gave this special missions you members of the royal guard of immortals and it's led by our facilities. They had set out in silence at nightfall, aided by full moon.

Speaker 1:          16:05          After a had climb through the ANA on mountain range up to 1000 meters. They easily brushed off and bypass the thousand fish and guards posted by the [inaudible]. Notice these troops were ill prepared and were taken completely by surprise. We all know just as long been blamed for not posting a stronger reinforcements on the anti a path. By the morning of day three of the conflicts the Persians had the Greeks out flanks. We honored us was now when a pencil grip caught from the rear. Now as well as the front, it is at this point that Liana does having recognized the hopelessness of the situation, gathered his forces together and ordered all of the trips except the Spartans to make their escape. Their cities would need them to fight another day, but the Spartans were to make their last stand right there at Thermopylae. All melted away except for a group of about 400 from Thespis.

Speaker 1:          16:51          When asked by the king why they too did not go, they replied that they have stayed because the Spartans of state, they would die with them. The Greeks made their last stands mostly outside the middle of gate wall. Liana just showed himself a true spartan with the order that he gave his men before the final encounter this evening we shall die in in hades. This Barton's sold their souls that are heavy cost. The Persian losses at the beginning of day three were reportedly heavier even from those sustained on the previous two days. The Greeks depleted though their numbers were repeatedly drove the Persians back then. Inevitably, the 10,000 of the Persian royal guard of immortals emerged from the rear. The honor this fought and died like a man possessed when his sword shattered. After one too many death blows. He used his hands and his mouth to inflict injury upon the enemy.

Speaker 1:          17:38          The exact manner of his death is on recorded, but we do know that as soon as he fell, the Persians took hold of the body and tried to drag it away. Seeing this, the Spartans lapse on their king and attempted to pull him back four times the on it. As his body was dragged away before the remnants of the spot and defenders got full possession of us and formed a defensive circle around it. In this position with that spears and lances broken their bodies battered and bloodied and they're dead king, and that missed the Spartans resulted to throwing rocks at these surrounding force of Persians. Finally, a massive head of arrows was launched and the last Spartans were cut down. Perhaps the greatest testaments do. The effectiveness of the heroic defense, which Leon at us had affected against the Persians was the treatments of his corpse by so axes, the spartan king was decapitated and his body was crucified.

Speaker 1:          18:27          So axes then went about trying to hide the true number of casualties that his men had suffered. But the great defense by the Spartans could not be hidden from history. The death on honored us and his fellow Spartans greatly lifted the Greek morale and the vital period that the Spartans that held up the Persian advance gave time for the Athenian Greek fleet to wreak havoc on the Persian navy and eventually lead to the defeat of the Persians. So by giving his life so dearly at the [inaudible], the owner, this became the savior of his people. So I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.
