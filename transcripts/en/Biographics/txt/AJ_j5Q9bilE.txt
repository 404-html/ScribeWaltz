Speaker 1:          00:00          By the age of 24 Hermann Garing was a famous combat pilots, a national hero and leader of Germany's most celebrated fighter squadron. By the time of his death, less than 30 years later, he was reviled as a monster with the blood of millions on his hands, highly decorated combat pilot, drug addicted, lunatic international statesmen, and one of the 20th century's most notorious criminals. Garren's life was one of soaring highs and crashing lows. And in the biographics video this week we explore the life of this man.

Speaker 1:          00:45          The young Hermann Goering enjoyed a privileged upbringing. His own mother and father had missile money, but his Jewish Godfather, Dr. Herman Epstein, was fabulously wealthy and he welcomes the gehrings. Do you live at one of his two castles? This appearance acts of altruism was no doubt influenced by the facts that Epstein was having an affair with gehrings mother. If her mother was aware of this, then he didn't seem to mind. The two became close with Epstein Encouraging Hammon and his love of hunting, climbing, and adventure. When Goering develops an interest in all things military. It was again his Jewish godfather who pulled some strings to have the boy in roles at the prestigious military academy had calls row in 1914 the great European powers when to war Garing was by then 21 years old and serving in an infantry regimens sensing that would be better opportunities for glory. Elsewhere.

Speaker 1:          01:33          He applied to join the imperial German flying call and began his new career as an observer, but when the opportunity arose, do you get behind the controls? He seized it with both hands. He proved to be a natural flyer. It's thanks to the countless hours he'd spent hunting. He was already a lethal marksman. This was a deadly combination for an aspiring combat pilot. By October, 1915 bearing was newly qualified and hungry for glory. He only had to wait a little over a month before he scored his first kill them. By June, 1916 is Tali had risen to three a few professions in history I've ever been quite as dangerous as a world war one pilot since in November, 1960 and he was shot down for the first and only time. Accounts of the incidents are sketchy and contradictory, but there's no doubt of that. Gehring did suffer an injury that kept him out of action for several months on rezoning to DOTC begins or rack up kills.

Speaker 1:          02:25          It's an impressive rate. He rose through the ranks of aces winning numerous awards for bravery and just fame began to grow. His face was printed on collectible matchboxes newspapers and magazines featured articles on him. Everywhere he went, people treated him like a celebrity Gehring. He adored the attention. In April 19 the Germans suffered a major blow when their greatest pilot man read Ron Rec. Seven better known to history as the red baron was shot down and killed. Race often had been commander of an elite squadron made up of Germany's find a stamina. It was assumed that his replacement would be drawn from their and the likes of earnest Udit and Luther von Rick. Seven the red baron's brother were considered the most likely candidates, but as it turned out, he was actually Hermann Goering who landed the job. This game is something of a surprise guttering. He hasn't been part of the rector, often squadron, and he was still some way off the top of the charts in terms of Kilz.

Speaker 1:          03:18          However, Garren had skill, he had charm, and he seemed to be a natural leader. Gehring took charge of the rich often squadron, a difficult time. The balance of power in the ad swung back and forth through the war, but now the allies were firmly in the ascendancy. German aircraft production couldn't keep up with the British and French factories, attrition and exhaustion where taking their toll on German pilots as well. The situation on the grounds, it was equally desperate. Shortly before gehrings promotion, the United States of America had declared war on Germany. A huge offensive designed to knock France out of the war before American troops arrived in any great numbers fails. Germany suit for peace and the armistice came into a, on the 11th of November, 1918 gehrings lost orders were to lead his squadron to a French Sheffield with Iraq. Croft would be handed over to the allies in a tearful final speech to his men. He predicted our time will come again.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Gatherings, exploits made him a household name, but he missed the excitement that the war had provided. Recruiting for other pilots from amongst his wartime comrade see put on a series of highly dangerous acrobatic shows, dazzling thousands of onlookers with his daring stunt flying when the public began to lose their appetite for this sort of spectacle called took on a more modest job flying charter planes. It was during this time that he met the love of his life counters. Karen Vaughn. Farc was sickly and frail and already married, but she was also wealthy and beautiful. The guttering, it was love at first sight. Karen, she felt the same way about the dashing m and and in 1922 she abandoned her husband's and a child to make a new life with Gehring in Munich. It was here that the couple of first encountered adults. Hitler at this point in history hit though is still something of a non entity rabble rousing demagogue with missile real power influence Karen.

Speaker 1:          05:13          However, she was in trust and she was determined to form an alliance between Gehring and this Austrian corporal Gehring willingly bounties face to that of ad off Hitler ends in November of 1923 he joined his Mazda and a plot to overthrow the government. 2000 Nazis with Hitler and Goering side by side and the front rank marched on the Bavarian war ministry hitting the believed the police would not oppose them, but you underestimated their resolve. They opened fire and hit the foul or by some accounts fledge while gathering was badly wounded by a bullet to his thigh. Hitler and his conspirators, they went now wanted criminals and this was a particularly difficult situation for Gehring since he was one of the most recognizable faces in all of Germany. While Hillary was arrested, Gehring chose to flee having received treatment from ironically enough, a Jewish doxa Gehring and carrying across the Austrian border.

Speaker 1:          06:04          The next two years would be the most miserable of gehrings life. Gehrings wound became badly, in fact, done in Austria. He was given injections of morphine to ease the pain. This was the beginning of an addiction that would almost cost Gehring his sanity and even his life, the ones athletic ace pilots way you said balloons, Karen and sold most of her possessions to fund gehrings habits and just wild mood swings after fearing for her life, faced with the very real possibility of losing Karen airing agreed to enter into a withdrawal or a program during the great war, the first battle of gehrings life, he had fought for his country for personal glory and for Prestige is second grade struggle against morphine. Addiction had none of that glamour. It was a feisty, very night he lost. He screamed at his nurse is that they wanted to meet death and even attempted to physically attack them for his own safety and the safety of everyone around him.

Speaker 1:          06:56          He was forced into a straight jacket and confined to a padded cell to Karen's relief. Gehring emerged from the depths of his own personal highlands. He was discharged from the asylum in October of 1925 less than a year afterwards. The German government grounds at him an amnesty absolving him of his crimes. He was free to or a townhome and to resume his service to add I'll Hitler who would been himself released after just nine months in prison, having failed to gain control of Germany by force, Hitler instead attempted to seize power through the ballot box. In order to accomplish this, he needed a wealthy back is to embrace the nationalist socialist because Hitler was a brilliant public speaker, capable of whipping crowds into a frenzy, but in more intimate social settings, he was awkward and uncomfortable. Most of the other senior Nazis were unsophisticated thugs.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Only. Garing was entirely at home wining and dining German society's elites gathering that threw himself into his new role. We've huge energy and commitments, but his beloved Karen's health was by now seriously deteriorating. In October of 1931 she collapsed and died leaving Gehring distraught. He would later condition the building of a huge country residence sets in 40,000 hectares of woodlands. Naming it. Karen hold in a memory in January of 1933 had succeeded in maneuvering himself into the position of Chancellor of Germany. Gehrings reward for his years of service was to be appointed Prussian Minister of the interior through his ministerial salary, corruption and bribes. He founds the means to fund the lifestyle that was becoming opulent to the point of absurdity to go along with his mansions is exotic pets centers increasingly ostentatious. The uniforms Gehring. He also held real political power. His first step was to not certify the police, sacking 22 police chiefs and replacing them with men, sympathetic national socialism with the police loyalty or should he ordered them to crush subversive elements in society, which in practice meant Jews and communists.

Speaker 1:          08:54          Gehring made no attempt to distance himself from these killings. He stages every bullet fired from the barrels of a police pistol is my bullet. If you call that murder than I am a murderer. Everything has been ordered by me. The biggest threat to Hitler, however, did not come from the communists but from within the Nazi party itself, the folks of the essay, but Nazi parties own para military. Army had been useful to hit her when his rise to power, but they'd become a bit of a problem. Hitler wanted the essay to be broken up, but its commander and rom openly defied him. The men of the essay, they were loyal to Ron. If he attempted an armed cue, he might just succeed in toppling hip goring who hated Rahman's recognized a very real threat to his own power. He urged his fury at act and reluctantly hypno agreed on June the 30th 1934 the night of the long knives began.

Speaker 1:          09:47          It was time for Hitler to settle some old scores. Now on Strom was arrested. I'm shot dozens of those. You had angered or obstructed Hitler in one way or the other. Much of the planning had been entrusted to Guerin who executed the operation with great skill and they complete lack of moral scruples. Headless position within the party is now become unassailable, but he was already looking forward to the day when he could attack Germany's neighbors and a venture to feet and the Great Wall Germany was banned from building an air falls under the tons of the treaty of Versailles. So Garing was tossed with building a top in secret. The Germans had been preparing for the day when the air force would rise once again since long before the days of Hitler coming to power. While Germans were barred from developing military aircraft to the band on civilian aircraft had been lifted in 1922 since then, the German aviation industry has produced numerous fast mail carrying planes that could easily be converted into fighters and airline is that could be converted into Obama's Lufthansa. Germany's state owned airline, which was formed in 1926 would provide many of the pilots for gehrings fledgling Luftwaffe that showers with lavish funding. Gehrings fledgling Luftwaffen grew quickly and in March of 1935 it's existence was officially announced to the world.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Over the next four years. The Luftwaffe out red receive four times as much investment as Britain's RF and it's more than 10 times that, uh, France is our force. Unlike the allied air forces, it was designed specifically to operate in support of Germany's ground forces. The World Class Messerschmidt one oh nine became operational in 1937 and it forms the backbone of the Luftwaffe as fighter force. The drunk is Jua 87 stock, a dive bomber rammed machine for which neither the British nor the friendship and he'd direct equivalents which provide support of a Germany's fast moving armored spearheads. It's guttering later adult is captures. In 1945 we arms Germany until we bristled. Guttering didn't entirely share Hitler's his enthusiasm for war. And this wasn't due to any sense of compassion for the millions who would die, but simply because handsy much to lose his time was spent mixing with high society, indulging his passions for hunting and collecting art and expanding his own personal empire within the Reich.

Speaker 1:          12:06          Unlike Hitler, he didn't see himself as being on some sort of quasi divine mission to restore German greatness. He simply pursued a political career because it brought him personal power and enormous wealth. We're Hitler thought victory was inevitable. Gathering you it wasn't fair. He might find himself on the losing side. Just slide the reservations of many of his generals. Hitler chose war and on the 1st of September, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. The Luftwaffe, uh, was at this time the most powerful air force in the world. It's commander in chief, however, was largely untested as a military commander in World War One. He had spent a few months in command of a single squadron, but that was a very different matter to directing operations of an entire air force in a very modern war. While Gehring possessed the intelligence and ruthlessness of a great military commander, he would fail miserably in the role.

Speaker 1:          12:56          This was at least in part because the corpulence Gary had too much on his plate. In addition to being the Luftwaffe as commander in chief, he was also responsible for civilian and military aviation policy, the Reich's, anti aircraft defenses, industrial and economic policy, and a good deal. More than that. These responsibilities were far too much for any one man, particularly one who was once again sliding into drug addiction. In 1937, Gehring had been prescribed the pain killer park or Dan, they morphine derivative to treat a severe too thick. The tooth ache eventually went away, but Gehring kept on taking the drugs. As the war turned against Germany, Gehring continued to up his dosage. His drug use compounded his weaknesses as a military leader is continual overestimation of the Luftwaffe as capabilities, there's tendency to retreat from reality rather than face up to bad news and a desire to please Hitler, which repeatedly led to him making promises the Luftwaffe it could not keep sometimes with catastrophic results.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Gehrings fading capabilities were not immediately apparent in the attack on Poland's, the Luftwaffe, uh, made short work of the Polish air force and it's obsolete machines. In 1940 it was Frances done and the Luftwaffe are once again dominated the skies as German tanks emerge from the supposedly impossible, our den forest threatening to in circle the best of the French and British divisions as the British prepared to evacuate their army from the continent. The German army had spear heads were in position to sweep into Dunka can deal what might have been a death blow to the British expeditionary force going, however, persuaded had led that is Luftwaffen could finish the job on its own. The German tanks were halted in the Luftwaffen hit the British with everything they had the limits of what our power could and could not achieve had not yet been established and nobody had ever attempted to destroy an army from the APP.

Speaker 1:          14:43          If during kind of given the matter sufficient thoughti might not have been so confident. The vast artillery bombardments of world war one were not enough to win battles without support and the Luftwaffe couldn't come close to matching that kind of hitting power gehrings most spree of hollow and a huge armada of ships plucked to the British expeditionary force to safety across the English Channel with the British having fled the consonants in the French signing an armistice on the 22nd of June, 1940 Hitler was bemused ins in rage to discover the Britain had no intention of giving up the fight. He began planning an invasion but stipulated that it couldn't go ahead until Britain's Royal Air Force had been destroyed as an effective fighting force. Once again, Garing was on hand to assure Hitler that has lifted. Martha would make short work of the RAF. He believed the Luftwaffe to be superior in every respect, but this simply wasn't the case.

Speaker 1:          15:35          The British chant, roughly the same number of finances is the Luftwaffe are in this super marine spitfire is every bit as good as the gem and anyone I nines person also had the advantage of radar and just sophisticated ground control system. And thanks to gehrings and ability to get the most out of the German economy. British factories were producing more fighter aircraft per month than the entire Reich. Gehring also believed himself to be on the brink of victory throughout the battle of Britain best. He never came as close to the sea imagined. Gehrings third big mistake. If the ball runs, almost certainly his most calamitous came in the wake of Hitler's ill judged invasion of the Soviet Union. When the sick Thalami became in circles at Stalingrad. It's the only hope was to attempt an immediate breakout hit the hated of the idea of retreat under any circumstances.

Speaker 1:          16:21          So when Gehring claims the traps on me, you could be supplied from the, uh, the Fiera seized upon the suggestion. The idea was total nonsense. Scaring staff knew it, and I Geiringer really should have known it to their results. Who was the complete destruction of the sick Thalami and starting grads became the turning points of Welsh water here. So at this point, and Hitler no longer trusted Gehring and the Luftwaffe achieves reputation. It plunged new lows as the allied bombing campaign systematically destroyed German cities. Garrin now to be as best to stay out of Hitler's way rather than a tends to as many responsibilities. He spent the bulk of his time hunting. There's Karen whole plundering Europe, the avast you add to his enormous collection and consuming ever greater quantities of drugs.

Speaker 1:          17:12          On April the 30th 1945 Hitler committed suicide with the right collapsing all around him. Gehring knew that the war was lost. Unlike most other top Nazis, he either killed themselves or attempted to flee. Gehring seem to be under the bizarre impression that he hadn't done much wrong and therefore have less. It was a fear. On May the ninth he surrendered himself to the Americans along with 20,000 painkillers and one of the world's largest art collections. Most of it looted from all across Europe. Gehring had expected an audience with Eisenhower. Instead, he was accused of crimes against humanity and waging wars of aggression. His guilt or innocence, these charges would be decided at trial. While the prosecution propent that case, scarring was weaned off his drug addiction and placed on a strict diet. The results was that the much diminished Gehring who has blended his way through the wall was now restored to the cunning manipulative force of old of the 21 leading Nazis on trial at Nuremberg.

Speaker 1:          18:09          Garing was the most senior. He didn't expect to escape the death penalty, but he did intend to go down fighting. In one of the exchange, he rang so many rings around the prosecutor, this the American threw down his headphones and refuse to continue with the cross examination. Gehrings argument was that he hadn't wanted war and did work to avoid it when forced to fight through circumstances outside of his control, he had done so with the principles of a noble to tonic night. It was not in his nature to harm women, our children, and he had no nothing of the Holocaust. Given his powers of self delusion, he may well have convinced himself that this was true. Whatever the case he was enjoying being center stage again at least until he was presented with evidence that shattered this image of himself as a noble warrior. The idea that Gehring could have no, nothing of the Holocaust was absurd, but there was this little documentary evidence linking directly to it.

Speaker 1:          19:00          However, there were plenty of documents indicating that he had participated in the persecution of Jews and personality profited from it. Not only that, but tens of thousands of slave laborers had toiled and died in the Luftwaffe as factories and under Gary's leadership and look to ofa had conducted horrific and often lethal experiments on Jews, Gypsies, and prisoners of war and funds in Europe for works of art, ordered prisoners to be shortened, had allied m and lynched. The judge found gathering guilty on all charges and pass down a sentence of death by hanging Gehring objected. He was a soldier. Rents as soon as she should be executed by firing squad rather than hanged like a common criminal. When his demand was refused, Gehring took matters into his own hands. On October the 15th he bit down on a cyanide capsule. Quite our Gehring obtains this cyanide capsule is still not known for sure.

Speaker 1:          19:50          His suicide note explained that he felt no obligation to submit to his enemies justice while awaiting trial. He had told psychologists that within 50 years there would be a statue of him in every German in town. Gehrings opinion of himself had not been dented at all by defeat, but his judgements of his place in history, certainly well wide of the mark, his exploits as a brave fighter, pilots have been utterly eclipsed by his crimes. Few men have a trashed their reputation quite so comprehensively as Herman Gehring. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
