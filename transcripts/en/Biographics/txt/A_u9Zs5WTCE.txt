Together with her two older sisters and two brothers, they lived in a mansion called Park House in north England. As you can imagine, Diana grew up with the best things that money could buy and she went on play dates with children in the royal family, but all of the money in the world can't buy happiness drawn in Francis. They had a toxic marriage mold her life. His parents never said, I love you to one another or indeed to their children. They pushed off most of the parental duties.

Diana to siblings deeply resented rain as an evil stepmother and blames half a, tearing the family apart. Diana was a shy girl and she struggled in school. She was labeled as the thick one by her family and this was enough for her to ends up crying in school. Every time she got a bad grade, deep down, all she really wanted was to be loved and accepted for who she was and dreamed of a prince who was going to take her away so she could live happily ever after.

Prince Charles had been dating several women over the years, including Camilla, Rosemary Shan's. Camilla was not wife material in the eyes of the Queen, so she married a multimillionaire named Andrew Parker Bowles. Charles and Camilla never actually broken off that relationship and they continued having a secret affair the entire time that she was married. Charles was now in his thirties and under lots of pressure from his mouth as he settled down and produce an APP, he needed a wife that was a member of the aristocracy and Diana had all of the qualifications of a perfectly acceptable bright off going on. Only 13 dates. Charles proposed to Diana when she was a belly legal 18 year old, even though they hardly knew one another to nfl, says the becoming the princess was the sense of destiny that she had been waiting for all along a couple of weeks after their engagement.

Dan replied, of course, Charles Loft saying whatever in love means watching the tape. You can clearly see that Diana was heartbreaking and later interviews, Diana defines that instance, is the moment she knew that marrying him would be a huge mistake. However, the entire world had their eyes on her and she knew it was her duty to go through with the marriage. Even to this day diner and Charles still go down in history for having one of the most expensive weddings. Experts estimate that today that wedding would cost anywhere from 70 to $100,000,000.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Diana was still just a teenager when she was put under pressure by the media to be this perfect princess combined with a healthy marriage. It was enough to make a spiral into a deep depression and she became. She had so much empathy for other people. That's a particularly difficult meeting, visiting the pole sick and we Beta mental health a lot worse. Instead of recognizing that she needed help, Diana was treated like a child throwing a Tantrum and the royal family just continued to ignore her issues. William was born when Diana was 20 years old, just barely out to that teenage years. She was to raise the future king that's a William Reuter loss of joy and purpose to our life during interviews. That press would mostly ignore how while they spoke with Charles, asked Diana how the baby was doing, even though this was actually very demeaning to Diana's face, would light up and she would gush about how much fun she was having with him.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Even officer giving birth to the. Our relationship with our husbands remains coles and distance.

It is easy why people believe that James Hewitt might actually be Prince Harry's biological father. This is such a popular theory that it was even turned into a stage play that was performed on the west end. Diana pushed Charles to be more involved in raising the boys instead of relying totally on Nannies. When the boys were old enough to go out, she made sure they had normal experiences like waterparks, Mcdonald's, and shopping. She also brought them to homeless shelters to pass out hot tea and food.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Prince Charles, he scoffed at these ideas and asking why all of that was necessary when she was 25. Diana fell in love with her bodyguards. Barry Maliki. They became best friends and she felt very safe around him. April's lots of joy to our life, but Diana claims that they never actually crossed the line.

His job at the royal palace sparing anarchy was killed in a motorcycle accident. Charles and Diana were on their way to the con film festival in France when he told her the news. Charles mentioned many death so casually. It was as if he was talking about the weather. Diana wanted to cry there. She knew that within a few moments you would have to step out of the car and to be photographed by hundreds of people, so she had to put on that smile once again and just pretend like nothing was wrong.

Speaker 1:          07:51          She and I just said, I think he was bumped off, but we'll never know. Diana felt that if she did not escape the marriage, she really might want to take her own life. She knew that her only hope of getting a divorce would be to get the public on her side.

She believed that her son, William would do a much better job serving the people Diana said of herself that she wouldn't go quietly saying that's the problem. I'll fight to the end.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Diana and Charles were separated for years and seeing other people off to the bickering back and forth in the media.

Speaker 1:          09:51          These became much needed therapy sessions for her.

These tapes were confiscated by the royal family and the public were not able to see them until years later. Diana, she became a traditional celebrity without the benefit of royal security. The you continued to follow her and write about her in the tabloids. Instead of allowing the press do you only write about her hair and fashion choices, she decided to make the best of being in the spotlight by getting involved in causes that matter tat she raised awareness about the aids epidemic and travel to several African countries to fight for the ends of landmines and public spaces.

She auctioned off all of our designer gowns and gave millions to charities that she cared about all of this, and you made the public love her more and she was still a princess in the hearts of the people.

He lived a very glamorous life, pepper add, see took photos of them on vacations around the world, the British press schools in a playboy and write negative connotations about the fact that he was Muslim. He was actually a successful movie producer who was best known for the Oscar winning movie starring Robin Williams. It was also the RTD multibillion dollar Harrods department store. Fortunate. The two of them were very much in love and they plans on Sunday getting married. Some even believe that Diana may have been pregnant with his child. If this was true, it would have cost a lot of issues for the royal family. The idea that William and Harry, you could have a Muslim half sibling. It was unacceptable. She was also threatening to reveal more and more secrets about the royal family to the press or charity work as well.

Speaker 1:          12:10          It often interfered with money making schemes among the inability indeed she even received death threats on a regular basis. Not long before her death. Diana wrote a letter to a Butler saying that she believed her ex husband Charles was trying to have are killed in a car accident. She also cold duties. Father Mohammed all fire engines told him the same thing. On August the 31st 1997 dirty Fiat and Diana were being driven through Paris on that named Henri poll, just as they entered the alma tunnel. They were apparently running from pepper, etsy and ended up in an accident. For whatever reason, every single one of the security cameras inside the tunnel just so happens not to be working that day. So there is no recording showing exactly what happens. According to witnesses, the car went into a pole at 65 miles per hour and no one was wearing a seatbelt.

Speaker 1:          12:56          On September the sixth, 19, 97. The streets of London where lines with people moaning, Princess Diana's death. Millions do. You didn't watch the funeral procession on TV. They're all cortel to trial and found that the crash was simply an accident. However, everyone present at that trial was obligated, decide with the royal family and that findings. Many people think they were totally biased. However, in 1999, the French government also investigated the car crash and they came to the same conclusion. It was simply an accident. However, in 2008 and new independent investigation found that the driver Henri Pool had been drinking heavily that day and the original trial had failed to mention that they also concluded pepper add, see vehicles. In fact, tailgating the calm, the jury concluded that Henri Paul was responsible for the deaths and that if he was still alive, he would be convicted of meme set. For some, this investigation was not enough and one of those people was Dodi's.

Speaker 1:          13:48          Father Mohammed are fired. He had spent years of his life struggling with racism while running his business, and he was disgusted by how the media is portraying Dodi, even though he was a victim to Mohammad. All five claims that he had evidence for 175 separate conspiracy theories and paid for a documentary called unlawful killing to cover them all. Obviously in this video we call him go too deep into all of the conspiracy theories, but it was enough for the British government to ban the documentary from being seen in the United Kingdom. According to these conspiracy theories, Henri Paul was actually sober that day because the receipts from the hotel showed that he only had two drinks at dinner and had gone through a medical exam by security beforehand. He had actually outrun the pepper ratzy and mysterious wide Fiat, you know, followed them into the tunnel with a group of motorcycles.

Speaker 1:          14:34          Some believe that these were on my six agents who were being paid by the government to kill her. After inspecting the cola, they discovered that the seatbelts and honorary pols car had been tampered with, which is why no one was wearing them. It also took over an hour and a half for the ambulance to get to the hospital even though they were very doctors, believe that if Diana was wearing his seat and into gotten medical attention sooner, she would've survived. Unfortunately, without videotape of the crash, we may never know the whole truth of the circumstances surrounding her death today, Princess Diana, she's not truly gone because she lives on in Prince William and Prince Harry's legacy because of her.
