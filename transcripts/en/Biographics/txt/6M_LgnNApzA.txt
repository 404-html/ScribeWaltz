You might never have heard of German chemist Fritz harbor, but there is a 50% chance that you owe your very existence to this man's invention. The process he designed to confess atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia made it possible to produce fertilizers on a large scale, ensuring much more plentiful harvests than ever before in the history of mankind and therefore saving billions of people from starvation. It is estimate is that the food base of half the current world's population is based on his harbor Bosh process. This achievement granted Dr Harbor, the highest of accolades, the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1918 and yet there is a dark side to this benefactor of humanity, a story of family abuse, of suicide, of blinds, loyalty taken to the extreme and it's the first ever use of weapons of mass destruction on a battlefield. This is the story of how Fritz Harbor, the Jewish scientist, unwittingly created the ultimate weapon that brought about the Holocaust.

Speaker 1:          01:31          The story of Fritz Haber has been described as worthy of a Greek tragic hero free training from it's very first year as all of the ingredients of a classic tragedy, father and son relationship conflicts of the early shadow of death and Hubris. And then of course there's the explosives. Fritz Alba was born on December the ninth 1868 in breast law pressure. Now, Rod Slava in Poland, his parents seek freedom. Paula, we're both members of a wealthy Jewish family established in the area since the early 18 hundreds to be more precise. They were members of the same family. They were in fact first cousins who would married against the will of their relatives. His life had barely started when it was already struck by tragedy. His mother died from complications. They need three weeks off to trial to bath his father. So he agreed. He was devastated leaving Fritz in the camera of relatives.

Speaker 1:          02:19          As a consequence, the two group cold and distance and then relationship. It never really recovered when his son was six, Siegfried remarried and had three daughters, Elsie, Helen and Frieda with him. Fritz actually got along with well, but the life of Fritz. It was to be shaped by his own ambitions rather than the influence of his family. He had the ambition to Mazda Science from an early age and the ambition to prove that he was first a German and then a Jew he was ready to serve is Kaiser and his recently unified fatherland. After completing high school in 1886 fritz declines and offered to become an apprentice at his father's dying company. The two men, they frequently clashed and simply could not work together. Instead, Fritz applied to study chemistry in Berlin. I think his doctorate [inaudible] 1891 having achieved a doctorate in less than five years was already impressive enough. Moreover, Fritz had to interrupt his studies for one year of compulsory military service and an artillery regimens. This was to be his first experience with the explosive power of modern warfare.

Speaker 2:          03:24          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Siegfried Haba made another attempt to to involve his son Fritz in the family business, but their personalities, they just weren't compatible. Fritz source. Instead, it's an outlet for his ambition in academia starting as an independent assistant at the University of unit from 1892 to [inaudible] 94 it was a unit that he decided to convert from Judaism to Lutheranism, how belong to one of the first generations of Jewish citizens to hit the labor market after the unification of Germany. He experienced a variety of options and opportunities that were not available to that predessessors and he had young Jewish men like Fritz. They still felt the need to convert in order to progress in their careers and prove that they were truly German Patriots Arbors Korea. It indeed flourished. In 1894 he moved to the University of calls or up published two chemistry treaties and escalated through the ranks becoming professor at the age of just 38

Speaker 1:          04:22          it was at the University of calls row between 1894 and 1911 that Fritz harbor invented and developed what became known as the Harbor Bosh process. Let me explain this step by step. They use of nitrogen based fertilizers to increase production of agricultural crops had already been in use for decades. These fertilizers way expensive as they relying on imports of sodium nitrate from South American countries, mostly Chile and so where exactly do you find sodium nitrates? Well that would be in Guano or in other words, bird crap. Yup, that's right. The economy of entire countries depended on bird crap and yes, wars were fought over it and yet nitrogen, well, nitrogen is one of the most common elements in the atmosphere. Indeed, it makes up 80% of the air we breathe. The genius of harbors invention, Wistia fixate nitrogen to hydrogen under extreme conditions of pressure. This resulted in ammonia, which would then become the main ingredients for cheap and efficient fertilizers, which we still use today.

Speaker 1:          05:21          The consequences of this invention, they've changed the world as we know it. Before the Harbor Bosch Process, the world's population had plateaued, is about a billion people and this was due to the inability to produce enough food for everybody, but the new fertilizers they were going to change that. Fritz all of his process, the growth and sustainability of the world's population is such that it has been estimated that the food base of about half the world's current population derives from the Harbor Bosh process. This invention, it was hailed as a miracle and it was described by his contemporaries as brought or stir loft or bread from the APP.

Speaker 2:          05:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Three years went by and harbors endeavors. They were about to change as Germany and the whole of Europe rush towards war in the autumn of 1914 harbor enthusiastically volunteered to put his signs in the service of the Ministry of war and he had the right experience at the right time. Often Germany had invaded Belgium in August causing the British Empire to declare war. The Royal Navy had launched a blockade on gem and Portstewart slowly choke the Kaisers war industry explosives, just like fertilizers. They relied on heavy quantities of nitrogen to be produced, which of course at that time still required massive amounts of bird crap from Chile, but with the British blockade, the explosive factories, they soon ran out of supplies as a result of the gem in itinerary. Could have been left without ammunition off to 86 months of war. This, this is where Fritz Hover and enters the picture during peacetime, he said a scientist to belongs to the world, but during wartime he belongs to his country. His first achievement was to adapt to the Hama Bosch process to the production of explosives, many of which and nitrogen based compounds. It's fascinating how this elements can be used to both raise crops and also cool. It's such destruction, but Fritz Saba now left tenant Taba. He had higher ambitions. He gets approved again that he was a true gentleman and a tree patriots. He approached the high commands with a new proposal. This proposal was the weaponization of chemicals to break the stalemate of trench warfare on the western front.

Speaker 1:          07:28          Thursday the 22nd of April, 1915 British and Canadian troops are entrenched in that position, is facing the German lines on the heat press salient in western Belgium all appears quiet. The allied observers for most of the day until that is exactly 5:00 PM a gentle Westwood breeze. Dawn's blooming in that direction, but today's wind is carrying a strange missed, which seems to build up and thicken yod off the yard. Some soldiers notice how birds caught in the cloud and Midaz simply stop flapping their wings and drop like stones to the ground. The clouds. Now a rolling toxic wall of intangible death causes even the leaves and they ads of grass to shrivel and die. On This Day, the 22nd of April, 1915 at 5:00 PM the gentleman imperial army launched a surprise attack against the allied trenches, the secret weapon 5,700 cylinders containing 150 tons of chlorine gas. The mastermind behind the attack left tenant, Fritz Haba.

Speaker 1:          08:27          He had come to the front stoop personally supervise the opening of the valves that would unleash the first successful use of a weapon of mass destruction on the battlefields and British soldier left and accounts of what happens when the cloud of Corrine reached the allied positions. It reads, the living wall of green fog about four feet in height, moved towards the French line and spread out to a width of about 180 meters. As the wall of smoke grew higher, the whole area disappeared into it. Suddenly the rifle far from the French but gradually die down. Soon. We have strange shouts coming from the green fog. The cries became weaker as morning coherence. Then masses of soldiers tumbled upon us from out of the fog ans collapsed. Most weren't wounded to. They had expressions of terror on their faces. The effects of chlorine gas on the body that just plain nasty.

Speaker 1:          09:15          The gas cools is acute inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs to which the body's immune system reacts with an overproduction of Mucus seemingly always cog off and you don't have to gasping for breath. That wouldn't have a com. It's like drowning on dry lands was Fritz Saba and any way concerned about the ethics of chemical warfare, but apparently not as he was quoted as saying, death is death no matter how it is inflicted. Although the battle ended in a stalemate. Typical of the Western Front hobbits contribution ends, initial gas attack was considered a complete success and he was rewarded with a promotion to captain and some days of leave away from the front, but it was he away from the pain and the misery and the death. We're not ready, but before I get into hobbies life, I do want to mention a quick word from our sponsor for this episode.

Speaker 1:          11:19          now. This point, we do need to stop for a moment and rewinds and take a closer look at another character in our story who is often overlooked in life and when almost forgotten in death. She is Fritz's wife cholera. Cholera is life mirrored in many ways. The life of the husbands. She too was born into a Jewish family from breast law and 1870 from parents who were first cousins and it's just like Fred Street, then converted to Christianity at the age of 27 but most significantly. Clara was also a chemist and a brilliant one at that. Overcoming societal pressures and the unfairness of a patriarchal society that disapproved of women scientists, Clara and enrolled in the breast law university earning a doctorate Suma cum laude in 1900 she became the first German woman to be awarded a phd in chemistry, Flora and Fritz. They met with the first time in 1898 it dancing lesson and they fell in love and then for proposed to her shortly thereafter, but unusually for that time Clara had declines.

Speaker 1:          12:15          The offer is she first wanted to establish her own financial and personal independence. Fritz did not give up and z continued as courtship, which culminated in their marriage in 1901 their only son, Herman. He was born the following year according to one of harbors, biographers, Diedrich Stoltz and bag. That union was a happy and successful one. Fritz was deeply in love with Clarins. Okay. Every occasion to dote on her as well as their child's not. Everybody agreed with that. Clara herself confided to her friends. This a life group more miserable. There's time went on as she put it. The main reason for that was Fritz is oppressive way of putting himself first in our home and marriage so that are less ruthlessly self assertive personality was simply destroyed their marriage. It's soon was in crisis. Pardo was seldom at home and made his disdain for his scientific endeavors quite clear.

Speaker 1:          13:04          He runs on frequent trips with colleagues and even had affairs with other women and a letter to her old mensa professor abig. Clara had even complains that Fritz is games and scientific successes had been her loss. The fact is that Clara Mfr was not suited to the traditional subservient role assigned to housewives. In the early 20th century. She was a feminist, firmly believing that a woman's intellect was by no means in Feria to a man sinned. Yet even though she actively contributed to her husband's research on fertilizers or work at when's uncredited. In later years, she was confined to translating into English. Fritz is scientific papers. Clara was also a staunch pacifist and since denounced from the outset, the madness of the Great Wall when Fritz started contributing to the war effort by using his harbor Bosch process to produce explosives, she was appalled and open late. The post is worked announcing it as a perversion of the ideals of science and a sign of barbarity corrupting the very disciplined, which ought to bring new insights into life. Then when our husband enthusiastically dedicated himself to the application of chemical warfare, well, this was the final straw to the fragile balance of their marriage and do our own psyche. According to Stolsenberg, she had a family history of depression. Kara herself may have suffered from it too. So she desperately pleaded with Fritz to cease working with the military, but instead of dealing with our views and private, his angry reaction was to denounce her in public of making statements that were treasonists to the fatherland.

Speaker 1:          14:37          All right, so now let's get back to those fateful days after the battle of eep prep. Captain Fritz Hall that is being celebrated by the German Imperial Army High Commands for his success with chlorine and he's now a bounce and leave for another mission on the eastern front. This mission, well it was the Russians turn to drown on try then maybe you can tell what happened exactly on May the second 1915 but we know at least some of the facts, flora and Fritz have another argument since they had been sparked by the role that he played in eat Bruh or the news that he was going to repeat his exploits against the Russians. That nice while he is sleeping, Clara walks into their garden carrying Fritz is service side. Sidearm a Luger nine millimeter. A single shot rings out Herman Khara and Fritz is only child age. Teen runs into the garden to find his mother slowly dying from a self inflicted pistol.

Speaker 1:          15:24          Shot to the chest, Clara dies and I'm in zombies. And what did Captain Haba do? Well, he just left. He was due on the eastern front to release more gas on Germany's enemies. And so he left the very next morning leaving common to grieve alone. Clarissa named [inaudible] in German means always true. Perhaps it was her desire to stay always true to how the leafs that led to her taking in life as, but Fritz, why did he leave his son alone in that terrible moments? Was it his sense of extreme duty and loyalty to the Fatherland? Was it unwillingness to cope with the responsibility of his wife suicide or we'll never really know for the rest of his life. Harbor never discussed any of the details of car his death on May the eighth alone arbitrary in a newspaper, report it on the suicide of the wife of Dr h if the secret service who is currently at the front adding that.

Speaker 1:          16:13          The reasons for the unhappy women's act. I don't know how that remarried to as data with Charlotte Nathan and had two children. Eva lutes, Parlez first son never approved of this union and the degree of feathering feather apart from his father and Disney family I'm in, did not have a happy life. He moved to the USA shortly before the Algebraic of World War Two and in 1946 he too committed suicide. Is that in daughter Claire was a chemist employed by the u s government's research and antidote for chlorine gas. When our research project was shut down in favor of work on the atomic bomb, she too for a third time in three consecutive generations committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Germany's defeat in November of 1918 was a devastating blow for Captain Harbor who is now professor Haba once again, that yet however brought him a much needed piece of good news. His invention of the hub of Bosch process was selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is winner for that. He has Nobel prize in Chemistry. The official motivation being for the synthesis of ammonia from its elements. Now it had been common for scientists have both sides during the war to serve and their respective countries, chemical warfare units, future Nobel laureates, James Franco stuff hubs to auto hunt, served as gas strips and hobbyists units, but probably the winds from the great war that was still too fresh and Harb. His prize was received as an outrage by the scientific community, especially in the u s and the UK where he was considered a war. Criminal Professor Ernst Rutherford, father of nuclear physics famously refused to shake.

Speaker 1:          17:46          Fritz Havas handed a conference in Cambridge in 1919 despite international isolation, Fritz Harbor, he managed to keep himself busy first. In 1919 he was appointed director of the newly founded [inaudible] company and I remember that name, that it's a chemical manufacturer specializing in fertilizers and pesticides and then came his next big project. The same way he had managed to make bread from Haba now devoted himself to turn water into gold or to be more correct. Do you want to do extract gold from sea water? This was his attempt to do support. The recently established Weimar republic by paying back Germany's war reparations to the allied powers. Unfortunately, the concentration of golden seawater turned out to be two skus and the process to extract it was too costly.

Speaker 2:          18:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:35          Does life all his efforts to serve his country as best he could to the German people would soon prove to be an ungrateful one. Let's not forget that dark forces where it works. During the 1920s and early 1930s as soon as the Nazis were voted into power, a new law was ratified in April, 1933 which prevented Jews from holding positions in the civil service. For other than time, he held the role of presidents of the Kaysville Home Institute for physics and Electric Chemistry. A smear campaign was launched, you Al Stim, although he is a convert and to form a world war, one decorated veteran was legally entitled to keep us post. This did not apply. However, to his collaborators, three quarters of which we're still Jews, and so he was simply audit to fire them. In this case, hover, applying a form of silent resistance to Nazi prevarications, delayed their dismissal until he could find employment for each one of them, but at Harvard had realized that it was time to go. Between the summer of 1933 and 30 1934 frets, his former wife, Charlotte and all of his children from both marriages all fled abroad and settled in the UK. Habo is now suffering from cardiovascular disease, but when he was offered a directorship at a research institute in British Palestine, he eagerly accepted halfway through his journey in Basel, Switzerland for Tava succumb to a fatal episode of acute heart failure. It was the 29th of January, 1934 he was buried in the local cemetery where his ashes were joined by as remains three years later.

Speaker 2:          20:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:03          Now, it is uncommon for us to continue our stories after the death of a main character, but what happened some years after Fritz harbors demise is suddenly worth telling. If you remember back in 1919 Hubbard had been one of the founders of the [inaudible] Gash chemical company dedicated to fertilizers and pesticides. One of their top selling products to which are the had personally contributed was in fact a very powerful pesticide for agricultural use and improvements on the existing hydrogen cyanide or prosec acid. It was enriched with absorbance and an Irish tends to act as a warning against leaks. It was used mainly for delousing purposes until August of 1941 and ss cabs in call each used it as a gassing agent to kill some Russian pdws. This came to the attention of Rudolph [inaudible] of a Nazi officials. They were looking for a solution to solve what they considered the ultimate problem.

Speaker 1:          20:56          You would say that they were looking for a final solution, a cheap and efficient way to exterminate millions of Jews, Roemer and other undesirables. The pesticide was modified to remove its warning odor, and it's I irritants so as to take the victim's completely by surprise. The original name of the chemical, well, that was Zyklon. It's modified version. The infamous is like plan B, the preferred killing tool used by the Nazi delirium too, and the lives of millions of innocent Jews and other prisoners in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Malveaux sin and to book involved among the countless dad with some of Fritz harvest relatives. This was the last defining act of the tragedy of Fritz Haber, a Jew who renounced his faith to prove he was a worthy German and demand torn apart by his ambition, his devotion to the fatherland and his inability to love those who were closest to him.

Speaker 1:          21:52          Well, this is where we end. Today's biographics. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Despite it's rather dark themes.
