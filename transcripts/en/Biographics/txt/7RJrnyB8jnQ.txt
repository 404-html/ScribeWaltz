Speaker 1:          00:00          Belle starr has come down through time is one of the great Amzie heroines of the old west. She is the bandit Queen, the female Robin Hood, who was quick with our fists and even quicker with a Colt 45 the reality though was quite different. Develop history was a battler who made some bad choices in men. Ended up twice widowed with two children and made the most of the cards she was dealt only to me, it's the most violence events in today's biographics. We go beyond the legends to reveal the Real Belle Starr

Speaker 1:          00:42          myra mayor bell Shelly. The future bell star was born on February the fifth 1848 in Jasper county, southwest Missouri. With that fact, establish drilling down on the rest of her life becomes far less. Certain. Much of what is accepted is the stuff of dime novel fiction. Sorting out the fact from the fiction here, it's been a bit of a major challenge. Now we do know that her father, John Shirley was onto his third wife when Myra came along. That third wife was named Eliza Pennington Hatfields and she was a member of the Hatfield family. Who famously feuded with the Mccoy's or the couple. I had three other children, all of them boys with Myra being the second oldest, John Shirley. He was a wheat corn and hog farmer. When Myra was six years of age, he sold the farm for a tidy profit and relocated the family to Carthage, Missouri.

Speaker 1:          01:31          He invested in real estate managing to take possession of an entire city block that housed a livery stable blacksmith shop, a tavern, and to hotel John Shelly. He was a slave owner who is ardently pro slavery in the explosive years before the civil war. Tensions. They were high between pro and anti slavery forces in Missouri when his oldest son budge joins an infamous gang of confederate sympathizers known as Quantros Raiders John. He was extremely proud. Meanwhile, Myra, who insisted that she be called bell whizzes growing into a fine young lady. Uh, parents were among the most prominence in Carthage and she was able to enjoy your life of semi privilege. She attended the Carthage Female Academy doing well in her studies where she studied languages, mathematics, and grammar. She was also a talented piano player who would entertain guests in the lobby of the family owned hotel when he was home from his rating expeditions bells, older brother Bud taught her how to shoot.

Speaker 1:          02:24          She became an excellent shot developing a reputation as a markswoman that would later fuel her reputation as the bandit queen. So bell was 13 when the Civil Water Apttus Carthage founds itself as a central point of hostilities with no fewer than 13 battles being waged in the surrounding area during the four years of the conflict with the war right on their doorstep. Every person in Carthage was forced to choose sides. Pro and anti confederacy factions develops with tensions escalating every single day. It has been reported that a teenage bell acted as a spoiler for the confederacy and even that she joined controls Raiders. Both suggestions are unlikely. However, any news that she may have gotten about a union treat movements she would no doubt have passed onto. But in June, 1864 bud was shot and killed by union soldiers in [inaudible], Missouri. When they surrounded the house that he was in desperate to prevent any further tragedy, the family packed up and then move to Texas.

Speaker 1:          03:19          It turns out they got out of Carthage just the right time. Three months later, it was burned to the grounds by confederate rebels determined to drawing of union soldiers out of the town bell jury of one of the families wagons as they wound their way down from Missouri to a small town, 10 miles southeast of Dallas called [inaudible]. Things doesn't go nearly as well for the Shelley's in Texas as they had gone in Missouri. John had hoped to reinvest in a hotel, but those plans didn't work out since he was forced to return to farming. Conflict arose with the locals who accused John of taking more than his share of water from the communal well, bell was enrolled at the local one room, school house, her attendance. However, it was pretty erratic. This was probably just cause she was bored of the material having already covered this when she was in college.

Speaker 1:          04:05          While that can cough edge bell had come across a boy by the name of John Reed Reed's who was two years older than bell, joined quadrilles Raiders when he was 17 he was told and stocky and visibility with his fists and a gun had and have the respect of the other members of the gang that admired him from afar, but that family moved away before a relationship could develop. Bell was ecstatic to learn that sometime around 1865 the reads that also relocated to Texas, they quickly became a couple ends on the 1st of November, 1866 they were married. Belle was 18 at the time, Jim and bell, they moved in with the Shirley family where Jim helped out on the family farm. Jim didn't take to farm work and see, tried to sound as a salesman who worked for a saddle maker in Dallas selling saddles and bridles for a time by the ends of 1867 however, Jim's family had moved back to Missouri and bell decided to join them.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Threads set themselves up on a farm in Bates County. Jim worked the lands with his brothers. Then in September of 1868 belot gave birth to a daughter Rosie leap from the starch bell took to calling the baby her little Pelle. Soon after this, everyone was calling the maybe pile. The first opportunity that John and Eliza Shirley had to see their granddaughter was when they'll rezone to Texas to attend the funeral of a younger brother Ed. The events surrounding the murderer cloudy, but it appears that he was involved in horse theft following the funeral and reunion with a parent's belt, returns to the read farm in Missouri. Her relationship with Jim, it was strained as he spent less and less time on the farm and more and more time at the horse racing track. It was one of the races that Jim ran into, a man named Tom Star. The star was a half Cherokee outlaw who made a living by selling whiskey in Indian territory.

Speaker 1:          05:42          A practice which happened to be a federal crime stall, ran the enterprise with his sons and they were soon joined by Jim read Jim's foray into the outnet welds. It escalated dramatically when his brother Scott was murdered. Jim vowed revenge and hunted down the killer dispatching both and his brother Bell, no founder stuff with a husband who was being hunted by not just the law, but also the friends of the man who had killed. We don't know what he did that to support the family, but suspicions are strong that it was through such nefarious means a stagecoach robbery and gambling. On February the 22nd 1871 bell gave birth to a second child, a boy who they named James Edwin nicknamed Eddie only a month laser. Jim was accused of accounts of it, money scam, and was forced to gains or relocate his family. When the La authorities began looking into his case, they discovered that he was also wanted for murder.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Jim Skips down and made us wear on horseback to Texas bell and the two children. They followed him by stage coach in March, 1871 bell turns up at the family farm in Texas with to your kids and to wanted husbands. Belle's father helped them set up on a small fan near coon creek and boss county, but Jim Reed had already proven that he was no farmer. Soon the farm was attracting a regular assignment of vagabonds. He would sit around with Jim and plan out their various crimes. Jim became involved in livestock russling when he learns that a local man by the name of Dick Crave, he had $4,000 in cash stashed at his home and his brother soul couldn't resist the temptation. However, the robbery was botched and they ended up murdering craving. A few months later, the brothers were accused of murdering another man. This man whose last name was wheeler, had apparently reported to the authorities what he knew about the read mobs, illegal activities he was found with his tongue cut out.

Speaker 1:          07:19          This latest outrage resulted in both Jim and soul having a $500 reward placed on their capture that are alive and is of course it was time to move. Once again, leaving the children with bells. Parents, the couple of heads headed into Choctaw Indian territory where the authorities would be unable to follow them. Jim was unable to stay out of trouble. Like on November the 19th 1873 along with two accomplices, he wrote to the farm of a wealthy retired judge who live near the south Canadian river, the judge and his wife. They were hung from a tree and forced to divulge the location of the cash in the house, the bandits, they got away with a huge sum of $30,000 by now. The strain on the marriage, it was simply too much. Mel was fed up with the life of crime that her husband had forced her into. She packed up and she took the children back to the family farm in [inaudible]. Reid's headed for San Antonio where he took up with a woman named Rosa us. He continued his outlaw ways, but fate caught up with him. When the former associate shot him in the back on August the sixth 1874

Speaker 1:          08:22          bell was now a widow and she had two young children to take care of. She stayed on the family farm with our parents. In 1876 John Shirley died this Forster laser to sell the farm and relocate to Dallas Bowel and the children. They went with her. Allegedly Bell was briefly married for three weeks to Charles, a younger uncle of coal younger in 1878 but this is not substantiated by any evidence. It's just a robot. On during the fifth 1880 Bell Married Sam Starve the son of her husband's former associate Tom Star pins. They settled in the Indian territory there she learns ways of organizing, panning, and fencing for the rustlers horse thieves and bootleggers as well as harboring them from the law. Uh, 23 the half Cherokee, Sam was nine years younger than his new bride. They moved into Cherokee nation territory and settled into a homestead, some 760 miles southwest of Fort Smith.

Speaker 1:          09:11          They cleared three acres of land and planted corn that were plenty of fish in the nearby river and gain results. Also Pencil. It seems like the ideal existence, and it could have been if bells past hadn't gotten in the way for associates of Jim Reed, they began to learn the battle had a hideouts in Indian territory, which was safe from the reach of the law. So many of these analogs started showing up. The bell was forced to convert and nearby cave into a sort of robbers roost with three log cabins in the interacted. I've been zone now. Bell had managed to keep herself from any actual involvement in illegal activity. This changed in 1882 when she and Sam Austin neighbor, if they could put some horses in his pen a prior to selling them. The neighbor agreed, but it's on inspection pointed out that at least two of the horses belonged to other local farmers.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Salmon Bell ignored the claims and went ahead and sold the horses when the original owners of the start and horses found out, so they press challenges. Some of Bell, they were handwritten and indictment to appear before the court on the charge of larceny. Sam's father Tom, he put up bail for the couple, both bell and Sam. They were found guilty. Sam was given a years prison time in Detroit, Michigan. Well, Bella was sentenced to two concurrent, six months, spells at the same facility with their mother and stepfather in jail that children were farmed out to family and friends, Salmon Bell. They were model prisoners turning themselves in early release, often nine months. They sent a little back, ends a life on the farm and things. They were pretty quiet for a few months. Then in December of 1884 a former associate of Jim Reed by the name of Jim Middleton, turns up looking for a place of refuge from the law.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Middleton was wanted for murder, runs the law. They were pretty hot on his trail middles and hung around the area for several months. Then one day, Bellin Sam's ranch was rated by law enforcement offices from Lamar County. The offices had received permission from the Cherokee nation lead is to conduct the rate. Middleton was not hat the residents at the time, but the raid scad him enough to make him want to make a run for it. But with the law so close on his trail, he couldn't figure out a way to get out of the area without being detected. Bell came to his rescue though, suggesting that she drive a wagon with the children in tow to visit relatives in Arkadin soul Middleton, which hide in the wagon God make his getaway. When they were clear of prying eyes the plan, it was working well and then off to sometime Middleton was ready to light out on his own.

Speaker 1:          11:23          However, 17 year old pal refused to let him take a horse. This led to 14 year old Eddie heading off to the nearest farm and an attempt to do by a horse. He came back with a broken down offline map. It was hardly the ideal getaway transport about is. It was all the Middleton Hagins when he sat out on his own with bells. Colt 45 is only protection five days days. Uh, the horse was found in some scrub on a riverbank not far from Fort Smith. Then on May the 11th, 1885 Middleton's body was found a couple of hundred yards downstream. The authorities soon traced the gun that was in his holster back to bell. They also discovered that the horse they legitimately purchased by Eddie had previously been stolen. The end result was that bell was once again up on charges of larceny. This time around Bella was found not guilty.

Speaker 1:          12:07          However, she returned time. I need to discover that a husband Sam had been wounded in a shootout with the Indian police sound that now become ensconced in his own life of crime. Fearful of the rough justice that Indian police were likely to dish out to. Bell convinced him to hand himself in to the federal authorities. Sam was indicted for trial in February of 1887 and then released on bail on December the 17th. Sam Bell and the children attended a party at a neighbor's house. Everything. It was laughter and Merriman's until Frank West, the local law office, a town job. He and Sam got into an argument and that soon devolved into a gun battle in a minutes. Both of the men with debt,

Speaker 1:          12:48          Belle Starr was now widowed for the second time. Sam's death made possession of the ranch on Cherokee land. A bit of a problem. They had not bought the land. It was in their possession because of Sam's Indian blood. Now that he was dead. How I've I bells right of possession. It was disputed with pressure mounts are going to have to get out of Cherokee territory. She decided there was another solution. She married sounds brother Bill, July ATS, Jim's star, and we've actually was once again married to a Cherokee and so she had possession rights to the land. Now 39 bell was 15 years older than her third husband. The marriage of convenience. It was not pleasing to Pearl age 19 or Eddie age 17 both of them constantly argued with Jim, which was a source of ongoing frustration for bell around this time pole fell in love with a young man who in the course of time approached bell to Oscar consent to marry her daughter Bell flatly refused.

Speaker 1:          13:36          Giving the reason that she had long told pell that she could only marry a man who had at least $25,000 worth of property she needs or trying to trick the young men by sending them a letter with poles forged signature on it, stating that she had married someone else. The young couple of though, they soon figured out the reason, continued to see each other behind bells. Back before long pellet became pregnant bell, she was not happy. You're giving her daughter two options, have an abortion or never bring the child into her presence. Pell Chase, the latter option giving birth to a girl called philosophy. On April the 22nd 1887 she took the babies and live with her paternal grandparents. In 1987 Jim was arrested for horse theft. By this time, however, bell was making an effort to go straight. She had stopped allowing fugitives to use a places, a hideouts.

Speaker 1:          14:20          When it came time for Jim's trial, she refused to assist in his defense. Meanwhile, young Edie stone was having his own problems. He was shots while trying to steal a horse belt. Fears that he would die. She sent a message to Paul telling her that she had better come back to see how brother for the last time she added, however, she was not to bring the baby pillow returned to see Eddie who recovered from his injury. Bell put pressure on a daughter to give up philosophy for adoption during the visit. Po outrightly refused, but val was a stubborn woman. She maneuvered things behind the scenes and philosophy was taken from and placed into an orphanage in November of 1888 I think it was now up on horse theft charges of his own again, belt refuse to participate in the Defence Eddie's trial that was scheduled for March of 1889 he returned to the family homestead and reportedly threatened to kill his mother.

Speaker 1:          15:07          He then took off never to see belt again. Bells problems escalated when a couple of the Watsons turned up at the farm looking for sharecropping work. Bell decided to take them up on their offer. Keens and some extra money. Bell became quite friendly with Mrs. Watson. On one occasion. The woman revealed that in a husband's was as actually wanted for murder. This scores warning bells in bell's minds if the Cherokee tribal council found out that she was again harboring fugitives, they would surely kick her off the land. Bell offered to give the Watsons there sharecropping feedback and we'll just to get them to leave, but I'd go Watson. He refused. It was only when bell revealed that she knew that Watson was a wanted man, that he left taking up with his wife in a nearby tenant. Kevin,

Speaker 1:          15:54          on July the second 1889 bell as a young husband Jim, they left on horseback to meet Jim's trial appointments at Fort Smith. Bells intention was to accompany them halfway, pay a debt to the store on King's creek and then return home. They stayed the night with friends and 20 miles from Fort Smith. The next morning bell town for home while Jim carried onto the fort bell stopped off at King's creek. We actually had lunch at the local store. Further along the trail, she stops at the home of a man named Jackson. Wrote. This was a popular meeting place for locals. She hoped to see our son Eddie, who had been staying there, but he left before she arrived though was Edgar Watson, the sharecropper who forced off her land as his doorbell arrive. He promptly left after a short time eating and conversing with friends. Bell got back on her horse and continued towards time.

Speaker 1:          16:38          However, she never made it. She was blasted from ours by a shotgun blast. The killer then approach the dying figure on the grounds and blustered again, bells panic, toss it. Gallup's for home. That concern to pal set out to find her mother. At the time she got to the murder site, a young boy had already found the body bell mistaken to a farmhouse, barely alive. Pell was just in time to be alongside the moment that her mother took her last breath. The question of who killed Belle Starr has intrigued historians for well over a century. Both of our children have been suspects. Eddie has threatened his mother at least one selfish. She had disciplines in with a bullwhip that the most likely candidates is they'd go Watson. Watson was actually put on trial for the murder. However, the evidence was deemed as circumstantial and he was acquitted. He eventually returned to Florida where he was killed in a shootout with a posse.

Speaker 1:          17:26          No other efforts were ever made to track down the killer of Bell Star. There were several other potential suspects besides Watson, including July himself, and I don't really, July had been caught with the young Cherokee girl. End Bell had been making his life hell just a few weeks after bell's death. July was mortally wounded by a deputy. It was on his trail, so the facts of bell's does life not exactly as exciting or as outlandish as the fictionalized version that began with a dime novel, Belle Starr, the bandit queen or the female Jesse James in 1889 in summarizing how life or a Fort Smith Elevator report there about a year before her death, Bell said, I regard myself as a woman who has seen much of life. The reality was that she was not the female Jesse James. She wasn't even a bandit queen. What she was was a twice widowed woman with two children who did what she could to survive.

Speaker 1:          18:15          Only today to be shot down in cold blood. This is a story of hardship and tragedy in the real old west, her grave site, isn't it? If our naked Oklahoma or horse was engraved on our tombstone, along with these words shed not for her, the bitter tier, no, give the heart to then regress.
