Speaker 1:          00:00          What August the fourth 1892 Andrew and Abby Borden were brutally matters in their home in fall river, Massachusetts. Their heads had been split open in a fit of rage from nearly a dozen blows from a hatchet. There was no theft. There was no sign of a break. In the 32 year old daughter Lizzie Borden was at home when their parents were killed. She inherited her father's multimillion dollar fortune and everyone in fall river believed that she had killed her parents in cold blood. But in the end, that simply was not enough evidence to convict her and she was allowed to go free. Nearly 120 years later, the case is still an unsolved mystery. So did Lizzie Borden really kill her parents or is the identity of the real killer still unknown?

Speaker 2:          00:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Andrew Borden came from a long line of wealthy and successful people, but his own parents struggled with poverty. As a young man, he started working as an underwriter at a bank in fall river, Massachusetts. He used his paychecks to purchase investment real estate and ran furniture and textile businesses. He was eventually promoted as the manager of the bank, even though he was making a lot of money. He only paid for the band necessities for himself and for his family is fortunate. It grew to over $300,000 which in modern day dollars is about 8 million. He married a woman named Sarah Anthony Moss and they had three children together. Emma was the oldest. They had a second daughter named Dallas who don't as a baby. Lizzie Borden was the youngest daughter born in 1860 when she was only two years old and this, these mother Sarah became gravely ill and I was 12 at the time, so she was old enough to remember the death of her sister and fully understood the gravity of losing their mother on her deathbed am I swore to take care of baby Lizzie like a mother, and she took that promise incredibly seriously.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Three Years After Sarah Staff Andrew Board and married a woman named Abby Duffy, who was 15 at the time, refused to address Abby as mother and it's called her by her first name, her entire childhood. There's, he grew up to be very close with her sister Emma, who truly did feel more like a mother to have in a big sister. However, this backfired because teenage Emma was constantly reminding her younger sister that their birth mother was debt. Because of this, Lizzy never formed a close relationship with her stepmother. She leads to describe that relationship is cordial, but she grew up feeling as though she never really knew a mother's love. We don't know much about the intimate details of there's these relationship with our father accepts that he was a very busy man as he had a full time job and also ran his own businesses on the side.

Speaker 1:          02:40          There's, he claims to love him very much, but it's true business tactics and lack of empathy for customers defaulting on some of their loans because some people in town to dislike him as well as his family. Lizzie Borden's elementary school teachers described her as being aloof, so she was either painfully shy or felt as though she didn't want to make friends. She was also for having dramatic mood swings. She could either be very relaxed and unemotional or she could burst out in a fit of rage. This is not uncommon for children who have lost their parents at a young age, but she was severely neglected considering for tragedy that had before than their family.

Speaker 1:          03:21          The wealthy members of the extended board and family lived in mansions up in a fashionable neighborhood called hell. They enjoy, it's an easy life with teams of seven so that they can call Andrew Borden on the other hands, rented half of a duplex for his family and waited until this children were grown to buy that house and combine both harvest and do a single home. He never installed electricity or indoor plumbing even though it was actually quite affordable at that time. As she grew older and as he began to learn more about her extended family who lived up on the hill, her cousins were always attending parties and dances and went to the local theater together with young people their own age does. He wanted to join the rest of our friends, but Andrew Board and thought that these activities were simply a waste of money. He never gave his daughters and allowance to attend any of these social outings living in a working class neighborhood unless he seemed far too rich to fit in where they lived, and yet their father never gave them money to socialize up on the hill.

Speaker 1:          04:18          They were stuck in an isolating situation and they felt like outcasts or cousins or married rich man and their fathers paid dowries to help them buy their own houses. Meanwhile, Lizzy and Emma were still living with their parents as their only social interactions came from church related events. Lizzie Borden really only had one close friends and that was her neighbor, Alice Russell. Many people who knew Lizzie Borden before the murders said that she was a gentle person with a kind heart. She was leave slices of chocolate cake for men who came to her father's house for maintenance and insisted on tipping the groundskeeper whenever her father was too cheap to do it himself. She also gave candy to local children along with cards that were signed from Auntie Borden, even though women were not allowed to hold a job at the time. Lizzie kept herself busy. She taught Sunday school to the local children in fall river, and most people in town knew of her as being a very pious and a religious woman.

Speaker 1:          05:13          She was also heavily involved in local women's charity groups. Washing testified that she loved her father very much less. He fundamentally disagreed in the way he handled his money. She also believed that her step mother was trying to take advantage of his fortune when she was 27 years old. Lizzie's father gave a house to his wife's half sister for free. This made busy Emma furious because they were his own daughters and yet he had never given them such an extravagant gift. When he realized how unfair this was, he gave his daughters the deed to the house he grew up into try and pacify them. However, there was a strict code of etiquette that unmarried women could not live alone. Since Lizzie and Emma never found husbands owning the deed to that grandfather's home was virtually useless and they were never allowed to move out of their father's house.

Speaker 1:          05:58          They eventually sold the house back to their father for $5,000 even after doing this, it was still not enough to make up for the jealousy. I'm the resentments that there's, he felt towards her step mother Abbey. Lizzie Borden was unhappy living with her father and her stepmother and she spent as much time as possible out of the house soon after the arguments about the houses Andrey board and agreed to let he visit Europe. But the trip, I only made her realize just how much she had missed in her younger years. When she retired in times of the United States, she often chosen not to eat meals with our parents and went up to the bedroom without even saying hello live in the boarding house. It went on like this for several more years in 1892 does he bought was 32 years old and her sister Emma was 42 neither of them had gotten married in the 18 hundreds this made them spinsters women who were considered to be 40 well defined her husbands.

Speaker 1:          06:48          There is no record of why they never married, but their family issues clearly had something to do with that. Lizzy continue to devote herself to the church as well as local animal rescue. She was raising a family of pigeons on that property and she loved them like perhaps in June of that same year entry purchase the hatchet and started killing Lizzie's bad so that he could save money on meat. Lizzy may have felt that how a window of opportunity to escape this dysfunctional family and find a better life was closing in on her. Her father was 70 years old and she needed to face the possibility that he may die soon if there's money was controlled by her stepmother. She knew things would get much worse at any moment. Lizzie Borden and to assist to Emma's lives, we're going to be over unless he did something to stop it.

Speaker 1:          07:41          As we mentioned earlier, Andrew and Abby board and were murdered on August the fourth 1892 the events leading up to them murders may give a clue as to what may have really happened on that fateful day. On August the second the entire board and family was feeling sick. I'll be bored and visited her local doctor asking if it was possible that have bread had been poisoned. Her doctor said that it was far more likely that she simply ate some rotten meat and that everyone in the house was suffering from food poisoning. This was not uncommon back then since there were no refrigerators to keep meat and cheese from going bad in the summer heat. On August the third the night before the murders, Lizzie and Emma's uncle John Moss showed up and announced he did not bring any luggage, but he asked to stay over night. John Moss, he was the brother of Sarah Moss, Andrew's first wife and the girls biological uncle.

Speaker 1:          08:31          For whatever reason, this named Lizzie Borden feel uneasy. She told her friends, Alice Russell, but she was terrified that someone was about to the family. According to his testimony, John boss woke up at 6:00 AM the next day. On August the fourth rigid, the maid cooked food for her master's and gassed and serve their breakfast to Abby, Andrew and John. Around 7:00 AM Jon announced that he was going to see his other relatives town and his left the house at around eight 30 in the morning there's, he said that she was feeling sick so she never said hello to her uncle law came down to eat breakfast with our family. Andrew Borden went to work at the bank around 9:00 AM according to the maid rigid Mrs Borden Asta to wash the windows outside that day and she said that she would have makes the bet and do the laundry in the guest bedroom. When Bridgette was done washing the windows, she was feeling exhausted from working in the summer.

Speaker 1:          09:20          He, since she was still sick to her stomach, she had been vomiting in the backyard and desperately needed some rest. Andrew was feeling sick at work, so he returns home around 11:00 AM but all of the doors were locked with a deadbolt, so is key to the front door. It wouldn't work. This was strange and he pounded on the door to have someone let him in rigid rush in the front door and unlocked it. Andrew Board and decided to take a nap on the living room couch, hoping that he could sleep off his sickness during his lunch break. Bridget saw this as an opportunity to rest, so she went up to her bedroom in the ASIC to take an APP as well. Lizzy claims that she had to go outside to the bond and look for a fishing lure for a trip that she was taking. The following weekend's according to her testimony during that small 10 to 15 minute window of time outside, someone had taken a hatchet to our father's face at 11 times.

Speaker 1:          10:06          His eyeballs were cut in half. His nose was gone and he was barely recognizable as a person anymore. There's, he walked back into the house and when she saw a father's mutilated body, she screamed. She called to Bridget, does how hard that her father was dead. She ran next door to a neighbor called Adelaide Churchill saying, I miss this. Churchill do come over. Someone has killed father. They notified the police and the family doctor. You arrive to examine the body. By that time, everyone in the neighborhood knew about the crime and re Borden's wounds were still fresh. It's suggesting that the attack had happened very recently. There's his friend Alice Russell rushed over to the house to see what was wrong. Lizzie, she was hysterical and leaned on. Alice for comfort. Lizzy asked Bridget to check upstairs for her step mother saying, well, someone find Mrs Borden. This is Borden was lying face down on the floor of one of the guest bedrooms.

Speaker 1:          10:55          She had also been killed by an ax, but this time in the back of the hat, Mrs Borden's blood was dry and medical examiners estimated that she died in roughly two hours before our husbands. This would mean that the killer must have been in the house the entire time waiting for the perfect opportunity to kill Andrew Borden. Lizzy sister Emma was out of town visiting a friend and they had to send a telegram telling her to come home. She had a solid alibi about our whereabouts, so the police removed her as a potential suspect. Rigid. The maid was home, but she had nothing to gain by killing her masters. She was also removed as a potential suspect by the police. When the police arrived, it was noted that no one in the house was covered in blood. If Lizzie Borden really did kill her father, she would have blood splattered all over our clothes. She would not have been able to clean herself off within a matter of 10 minutes, especially without any running water in the house. It's considering she was one of the only people home at the time that she had the most to gain from a parents' deaths. All eyes were on her,

Speaker 1:          11:59          stood with their family members and her father's business associates at their parent's funeral. Instead of watching their patterns cascades get buried in the ground, so the police, or did the bodies be taken for a second autopsy? The police also had free reign to search the entire house from top to bottom, and yet they couldn't find the murder weapon or any solid evidence that would prove the identity of the killer. Lizzie Borden was questioned by the police for several hours into answers where sometimes inconsistent as if she couldn't quite get her story straight. The beliefs saw this as evidence that she was lying. However, her doctor had injected her with morphine before each interview saying that it would help calm her nerves. These injections would have made her feel mentally cloudy and confused. In some cases, the drug can even cause delusions and hallucinations. Despite having this drug running through her vein story still never confessed to killing her parents leading up to the trial, I'm a Borden and Alice Russell witnessed Lizzie Borden burning one of her dresses in the back yard.

Speaker 1:          12:56          She claims that she was simply disposing of old clothes that have paint stains on them. She gave the police the blue dress that everyone had witnessed her wearing the day of the murders and it was completely free of bluffs. They also never found a bloody dress when searching the house, but the police saw the burning of the mystery dress as a sign that she may have changed out of the clothes that she kills her parents and she was trying to destroy the evidence. Lizzie Borden was arrested on suspicion of killing her parents and she was taken to a holding cell in a women's prison. The dates of the trial where from June 5th to 20th of 1893 this was nearly a year after the death of her parents, a pharmacist named Eli. Ben's testified in court that Lizzie Borden requested to buy potassium cyanide the day before the murder, but he refused to sell it to her because he suspected that she had terrible intentions when the police exam to the bodies of mister and missus board and the autopsy report showed that they had never been poisons.

Speaker 1:          13:49          It was just bad food. After all this meant Mister Benz is claimed, didn't improve that Lizzie did anything wrong. Her neighbor and friends, Alice Russell also testified against her about burning the dress. However, without having the actual dress on hands, they still could not prove that there was ever any blood on us after nearly a year to prepare their case. The police had nothing but circumstantial evidence against her and it was simply not enough to prove that she was guilty. The members of the jury, they were all men which was customary at the time. All of them had a very hard time believing that the same woman who was the Sunday school teacher could really be the same monster who committed cold blooded murder. They fought him more likely there's a prowler broke into the home and killed Mr and Mrs Borden. They only took 19 minutes to make the decision that she was not guilty

Speaker 1:          14:42          for a parents' deaths. Lizzie and ptosis to Emma split their father's inheritance in half and it was more than enough money to take care of them for the rest of their lives. They could finally afford buy and luxurious house on the hill called Maplecroft. They also harder staff have maids and the driver to take them anywhere. They wanted to go in a horse drawn coach. There's, he changed her name to Elizabeth after moving in in hopes of escaping her reputation in her mind's the life on the hill may have seems like a million miles away, but the reality was that they were still in fall river. I reputation as a murderer. I continue to follow her for the rest of our life. Magazine's reported false rumors that she was a shoplifter that she killed a baby kittens and birds when she was a child. People did not want to sit in there and charge and say our house was pummeled with rotten eggs on a regular basis.

Speaker 1:          15:29          No one wanted to be associated with this woman who may have murdered our parents, local children. They made up a rhyme without her murder and enjoyed singing it outside the window and it went. As such, Lizzie Borden took an ax. She gave her mother 40 wax when she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41 now, despite all of the criticism, Lizzie never moved away to escape the ridicule and tried to make the best of her situation. She began attending plays at the local theater and three parties in her new home for the cast and crew. She seemed to be particularly, in fact, she waited with an actress named Nancy Neil. Neal was known for having a deep voice and the masculine attitude, which led some people to believe that the two might have been having an affair. It turns out that O'neil was truly a great actress, worthy of admiration there because she eventually moved to Hollywood and start in a few movies.

Speaker 1:          16:16          Even though Lizzie Borden was now wealthy and living in a good part of town, she continued to be single for the rest of her life, but she may have been concealing a hit and romance. The only real evidence of the latter though was a letter that she wrote to a female friend saying something rather romantic. I dreamed of you the other night, but I Dan, not to put my dreams on paper for some unknown reason. Them or, and Lizzie got into an argument and Emma decided it was time for her to move out of fall river. She moves far away to escape the bad reputation that the board and then had brought them. The sisters never saw each other again. Some people believe that this is proof of Lizzy's girls and that she must have confessed to Emma how are the MLF. Shortly after one of Lizzy's big parties in which the actress, Nance O'neil was in attendance, some people believe that it may be more likely that she was caught in a lesbian affair or and the simply disapproved of her new lifestyle.

Speaker 1:          17:08          Lizzie Borden continued to live alone in her Maplecroft mansion for the rest of her life. She died at the age of 66 she left a significant portion of her estate to the fall river animal rescue league in her well, she also left thousands of dollars to each of our close friends and cousins. Today. Both our childhood home by the river runs Maplecroft mansion were purchased by an investor and turned into museums. To this day, people still speculate whether Lizzie Borden truly kills her parents, but we'll probably never know. So I really hope you found this video interesting as always at that like button.
