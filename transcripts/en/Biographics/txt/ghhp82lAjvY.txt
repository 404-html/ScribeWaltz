Speaker 1:          00:00          Angus con, the name that is synonymous with barbaric, cruelty and conquest. 800 years ago, he created the greatest army the world has ever known. Wielding it with tactical brilliance to lay claim to the largest empire in world history. No other man Alexander and Napoleon or Hitler ever came close to the level of success and conquest over the Mongolian man of steel. So how did he do it? Well, in today's biographics, we discover how he simple peasant arose from one of the harshest environments on the planet to take the world by storm.

Speaker 1:          00:41          What we know about the early life of this man, he would rise to rule. The world comes from an accounts called the secret history of the Mongols written. Soon after he died, it tells us the gang. Gus was born somewhere in the steps of Central Asia. Around the year 1165 it is said that he was born with a clot of blood in his hands, which was seen as important of great things to come. Can I get some was born into a harsh unforgiving world. The Mongols who lacked a common chief. We're broken into a number of clans who were constantly warring with each other. The landscape was vast and rugged, situated between Europe and China. It consisted of an inhospitable series of rolling hills, rocky outcrops, and freezing temperatures. The Chinese referred to the region as the barbarian wilderness and built a great wall to keep its inhabitants from reading their border regions for the Mongols strength was found in numbers.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Large families were encouraged with polygamy and accepted custom gang gets. His father had two wives. The boy's mother had been abducted from her previous husband in another tribe as a boy. Ganglius grew up with three brothers, a sister and two half brothers. His earliest years were spent hunting, writing and roaming the plains as part of Eaton nomadic society. As clan, we're constantly on the move seeking new pastures whenever the grazing for their sheep was exhausted. Ganga is reported. To have grown up as a brave and define young man is only fear being dogs. Yes, he was an introvert who preferred to spends the bulk of his time alone with his thoughts. He was fiercely independent. Seeing no value in consultation with others as he emerged into his teens. It was a parents too old that he had a sense of his own destiny and that destiny lay far beyond the clan.

Speaker 1:          02:10          That was then as well as was the custom at around nine years old gangsters. Parents arranged a marriage for their son. His wife to be was named Burton, who was from a neighboring tribe and gangs was to be transferred to that camp so that he could grow up alongside his bright. On the return trip after delivering his son Gangas, his father, I'm at a party of Tata, has on their way to a hunting expedition. They seemed hospitable offering and food and drink. However, the offerings, they were laced with poison and three days later his father died.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Gang gets quickly returned to the father of this family. They were abandoned by the rest of the clan. His mother Harlene now assumes the mantle of headship within the household. There was constant friction between the three sons of how the Nams, they're two stepbrothers, one a. When he was 13 years of age, Angus was holding a fish that he had caught when one of his stepbrothers came up and snatched it from his hands without hesitation, Gingiss drew his bow and killed the boy. This was the first clear demonstration of the absolute ruthlessness that would come to characterize the boy who would become the great con. By the age of 15 ganglius was stronger, bigger, and it's more skillful in hunting and horsemen shift than his brothers. His brothers began to bow to him. There's then natural leader, his reputation as a strong warrior. It began to spread soon, the clown that had deserted his family when his father had died, got to hear if there's some start fearing that he might lead as brothers against them.

Speaker 1:          03:32          He decided to take the initiative by invading the family's encampments and taking gangas captive. The Angus was able to escape the invaders, fanned out into the wilderness and nine days later they found him. Gang guest was taken prisoner and they heavy wooden yoke was placed around his neck a couple of days later, and while is was languishing inside, a guarded tends with the yolk still around his neck. His captors through a celebrator he party, despite the inconvenience of the oak gang guess managed to overpower is God. He got down to the river before his absence was discovered, unable to traverse the river while wearing the yoke. He then returned to the tense from which he had come there. He found the guard we had recently overpowered. Ganga is then displayed the shrewdness of thinking, which was to set him a pass. He told the guards that's unless he got him out of the yoke and gave him a horse. He would tell the others that the guard had helped him escape. The black nail worked until he was soon galloping away from his captors.

Speaker 1:          04:26          A year later at age 60 and getting us to return to the village of Berta girl, he had been pledged to at the time of his father's death. It was time to get married as a wedding gift. The girl's father gave him a spectacular sable coat. The next day, gang gets, took his wife back to his encampments and left her in the care of his mother. He then wrote off to a neighboring clan where he presented his new code has a gift of the chief Dean by the name of Todd rule. In doing so, again, this was purchasing the allegiance of this powerful clan leader. He asked or grill to help him win back the loyalty of the tribesmen who deserted his family after his father's death to roll with sympathetic and it's impact was formed between them. News of the alliance, it seems spread of the clans offered their support and before long Gingiss was able to call upon the formidable force for four years before he could put them into action.

Speaker 1:          05:09          However, disaster struck invading market. Horseman came thundering across the plains intent on kidnapping. The women of Ganga says camp. The majority of the clown managed to escape, but again gets his young wife. Bertha was taken captive by the markets gangas desperately road for the camp of to grow for help. Doggerel announced that he would ride upon the markets and destroy them returning butter to our husbands. Over the next few months, the alliance managed to bring together more than 5,000 warriors in order to ride with them. The attack was swift and decisive. The Mongol hoards decimated the market camp killing, looting and pillaging without mercy. In the midst of the campus, they found butter. She had been raped repeatedly and was pregnant shortly after returning to camp. She gave birth to a son, but it was never known if it was gangbusters child or one of the market rate tests

Speaker 1:          05:59          in the wake of the overthrow of the market's Gingiss went from strength to strength. He United with the clan of his boyhood friends Jamica. The two men became inseparable, decluttering themselves. Blood brothers, they lived together, ate together and slept together. This rouse, the jealousy of Ganga says wife and mother who began to spread rumors about to Jamaica and then just having to do drive the two men apart. Whether it was the influence of the women in his life or his own lust for absolute power. Something caused Gingiss to sever the bond with [inaudible] in 1185 the two plans worth moving towards. First, our grazing grounds when in to scientists to turn off and camp in a valley he called to Ganga is to join him again, gets ignored him and kept on writing, carrying on a mile or so. He turns in his saddle to see if there's not only had his own kinsmen followed him first as many of Jammu because men had as well.

Speaker 1:          06:42          Ganglius was now developing the largest following of any of the mongrel plants. This was achieved poly through the design for security and numbers and partly by coercion. Those who did not agree to give ganglius their religions while they were forced to do so. The combination of his desire for power and wealth and his need to feed his ever expanding, following led to repeated raids on other clams. The capture if they're women ans the plundering of their belongings. The secret history of the Mongols attributes equates to Gingiss, which may be familiar to fans of the 1982 movie Conan the barbarian in which the words were given to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character. The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you to rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them bathed in tears to ride their horses and clasp to your bosom. That wives and daughters at this point, still in his early twenties Ganga said already proved themselves to be brilliant at psychological warfare.

Speaker 1:          07:32          He would attack a tribe with horrific and devastating force in order to intimidate the surrounding camps to give up without a fight. As a result, many thousands of his enemies simply surrendered in order to avoid the carnage that would result if they resisted. Having subjugated ends melded into one the disparate Mongol clans Gingiss now set his sights on the furthest reaches of the barbarian wilderness among those who had not yet joined as alliance was his former best friend, Jabuka, who was now his mortal enemy. The people of the two camps that have been able to maintain a sort of uneasy peace. However, one day a disagreements over grazing lands erupted into violence with one of Ganga says men killing a warrior from Jim Lucas camp and outrage to Mooka reacted by attacking the much larger camp of Ganga the unexpectedness and lightening speed of the rage resulted in the killing of many and the capture of 70 of Ganga says chief teens who were taken back to Jim Lucas camp where they were tortured and boil the live gang gets.

Speaker 1:          08:26          He was shocked to his core at this humiliating defeat. He came to the realization that his army was not yet ready to engage in the large scale conquests that he had envisioned. Consequently, he sat out to to mold them into a war machine, a breed of warrior, the likes of which had never been seen before. The army that resulted was incredibly mobile able to travel an average of 70 miles per day. The men were subjected to the most severe discipline in order to forge their minds and bodies into warrior like steel. Before long the reputation, the barbarian super army spreads beyond the boundaries of Mongolia. When the rulers of the Chin Empire in China heard about them, they invited Gingiss to come and help them fight off marauding bands, the Tatas who were constantly harassing them. The toss is also a longtime enemies of the Mongols and Ganga saw this as an opportunity to exact vengeance while expanding his reach internationally.

Speaker 1:          09:14          In short order, the overpowering force of the Mongols crushed the Tatas resending to try and in their home country gangbusters army. It was immediately attacks by Jim Lucas forces. This time, however, Gingiss was ready over a series of three bloody encounters, Jamaica's followers. We're finally subjugated Jamaica, however, managed to escape fleeing to the sanctity of the Nyman's, say powerful tribe dwelling and the northwesterly region of the steps. When news reached to Ganglius, the Jamica joining the name and he set his sights on destroying them, he unleashed his 80,000 strong cavalry against them, totally overpowering them in a frenzy of blood Lessing amazingly, however, Jimmy kept managed to escape. Once again, he had with a small cloud of mountain dwellers. They fearing the wrath of the invaders betrayed Jamoca and handed him over to the camp of Gingiss. Gingiss. Though he was sharp's by the lack of loyalty to Jameka. Mandy had them all slaughtered. Then he extended mercy to Jamaica with an offer of a pardon but true. Mooka refused and begged to be put to death. A seeding to his wish can guess allowed his old friend to be suffocated to death inside a carpet. Despite his reputation as an unfeeling execution, Gingiss turned away unable to watch the scene.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Having the feeds of the Nyman's Gangas was now the supreme ruler of in excess of 2 million people. Having had a taste of supreme power, he now wanted more. That was still positive Mongo there that were not part of his empire. These were areas along the eastern and southern regions of the country. Over a period of months, he systematically beat into submission those who had not yet come under his yoke, Ganga [inaudible] road at the very front of his ferocious towards personally overseeing every detail of the attack, but his greatest skill and ability to handpick brilliant generals. In doing so. He managed to United people who had for centuries been a war with one another in 1206 the people made Gingiss best supreme ruler bestowing upon him the title of Con, the Great Leader as recorded in the secret history of the Mongols. The people proclaimed, we will make you a leader are great con.

Speaker 1:          11:11          We will fling ourselves like lightening upon your foes. We shall give you the fairest to girls from the enemy. If we disobey you, take our flocks and our wives and our children and throw while worthless heads upon the sands between military conquests, Skanga enjoy the rewards of success. He gathered more wives and had more children by his first wife about it. He had four sons who would each be given rulership over a part of his empire. Despite the wealth, luxury, and family with which he now surrounded himself. Gangas was tormented by vivid dreams in which he was continually riding in the conquest of one land after another impels by these dreams and his own innate ambition, he became fixated on the vast lands that lay beyond the Great Wall on our southern.

Speaker 1:          11:57          In 12 days. Six gangas cool. Together a great summit of his generals and tribal leaders to discuss his planned invasion of China between Mongolia and China. Neva kingdom [inaudible] the land of the time goods. This was a key trade where between the Central Asia and the West, Gangas undertook a campaign of conquest that within two years brought the entire kingdom of [inaudible] under his domain the way it was now open to invade China and an effort to capitalize on his previous dealings with the Chin Empire concent, a peace envoy over the wall, Jen authorities. However, they were suspicious of the visitors and they put them to death. On hearing of this outcome. Gingiss took two is tense and fasted. For three days he emerged to announced that the heavens declared that he would be victorious and the time to wreak vengeance upon the chin was now with 40,000 cavalry men riding behind him.

Speaker 1:          12:43          Gangas crossed the border, smashing over the wall and into China. They then swept down upon the Chin Empire. They approached with unrivaled speed and quiet until almost upon the enemy when the thundering of their horses hooves shook the grounds, the attacks that followed were overwhelming, crushing their enemies and destroying their encampments. It was during the Chin campaign that the ruthlessness of Ganga Eskom became legendary. He would use captured women and children as human shields in battle, forcing them to march ahead of his army as they approached an enemy village. Within two years of first invading China, Ganglius had reached the Capitol or lift the Chin Emperor John Do, which is modern day Beijing, the great city. It was encircled by a wall and strongly fortified Colin's army laid siege for almost a year. Finally, with the aid of siege towers and catapults, the Mongols manage to breach the wall after a fierce battle and that the cost of thousands of Chinese lives, the city fell off to subjugating the chin.

Speaker 1:          13:37          Emperor gang guest rode back to the step country of his birth, but it wasn't long before the spirit of conquest. One small fired his ambition. He now looks to the worlds beyond China. He looked to the fringe of Europe between China and Europe, lay the vast Islamic empire known as Kora San. This area was ruled by a Shaw who had power that equaled that of the Ganga is himself, but calm, did not wish to subjugate the lands of the shop. He sold only peace sending a caravan of envoys to acquire a satin. Yes. Just after they crossed the border, all of his men, they were captured and slaughters and enraged. Angus sends another group of envoys this time instructing them to go directly to the shop. They too were murdered by Islamic soldiers for Gingiss who believed in the absolute inviolability of envoys. This was far too much time for vengeance was once again his hands. He says out at the head of his largest army, to date more than 200,000 man years of savage butchery were unleashed upon the Muslim people. By the time the bloodletting subsided, Gingiss Carlton had wrestled absolute power away from the shop is vast empire now spans from the Yellow Sea and the east all the way to the Caspian and the west

Speaker 1:          14:41          before attending to the steps. Can Guess Khan and pointed his son who good day is the APP. He now face the problem of controlling his vast empire. In the summer of 1226 he wrote to the head of a 180,000 warriors to crush an uprising among the time good people before he goes to them. However, he fell from his whole since suffered serious injuries and didn't turn or bleeding over the coming months. He only got worse on August the 18th 1226 and at the height of his powers he died Ganga scarves, legacy. It would be cemented by his grandson, Kublai Khan, who extended the Mongolian Empire to encompass two continents and to become the largest empire in history. Perhaps gardens most enduring contribution, however, was this, although forge through unspeakable violence, his conquests brought about a peace and stability that's enabled the first ever flow of trade and ideas between the eastern and Western worlds.
