It's included the following, Mr Breslin, sir, don't think that because you haven't heard from me for awhile that I went to sleep. No. Rather, I am still here like a spirit.

Perhaps we shall meet face to face someday or perhaps they will be blown away by cops. With smoking 30 eights Breslin contacted the police. He noted that the letter contained the details of some of the crimes that have not yet been released to the public. They allowed the times to publish part of the latter as a companion to Breslin's printed response, which urged the killer to turn himself in that addition of the times, so more than a million copies, the NYP formed operation Omega the most comprehensive investigation in its history.

Speaker 1:          11:56          In order to bring the son of Sam to justice, over 300 detectives worked around the clock as a daily cost of $90,000 45 psychiatrists poured over the taunting letters that Burke of its was writing with the general consensus being that he was a paranoid loner who was unable to form relationships and with possible connections to devil worship on the nihs of the Moscow woods, Vln z shooting. A woman named Cecilia Davis was walking her dog when she saw a police officer at ticketing a young man in a car that was parked alongside of fire hydrants. Soon thereafter, she saw what appeared to be the same young man walked pasta as staring at a menacingly. It was enough to scare her into at speedy dash home. After the murders, Ms. Davis gave the information to the police. As a result of this, every driver who had been ticketed that night was brought in for questioning and one of the people on that list was David Berkowitz,

Speaker 1:          12:49          a detective trying to get hold of backwards over the phone, but there was no answer that just active then contacted the Yonkers police station to see if they could help get them in touch with Berkowitz, the dispatcher, he spoke to you. It just happens to be the daughter of Sam car, David's former landlord, and the inspiration for the son of Sam label that Burkowitz said, anointed himself with the detective, interviewed Sam Call who informed him that Berkowitz had shot his dog and was a pretty troubled individual. The physical and psychological description that was given to seems to gel rather well with the profile of the son of Sam. From this point on, evidence against Berkowitz quickly mounted. A suspected arson was reported close to his apartment, but he's interviewed David's former neighbor, Charles Gossman. He showed them the nasty letters that Berkowitz had written to him. On August the 10th 1977 detectives found his Ford Galaxy parked outside his apartment, although they didn't have a search warrant, they began searching the car on the back seat was a duffle bag containing a rifle.

Speaker 1:          13:45          Inside the glove compartment was a handwritten letter addressed to the Suffolk County police department that warned of a coming attack on a disco.

If he came out of his apartment, a swat team was deployed around the area. Finally at around 10:30 PM Berkowitz came out of his apartment and got into his car and detective approached and tapped on his window the sun there. Sam then rolled down the window and said, well, you got me. How come it took you such a long time?

Speaker 1:          14:24          The arrest of the son of Sam caused a worldwide sensation. It turns out that the monster who would terrorize the world's most famous city was a rather pathetic looking loser. Berkowitz admitted to all of the attacks providing details that only the perpetrator would know. On August the 11th he was charged with second degree murder for the killing of Stacey Moskovitz. The judge ordered a psychological evaluation to determine if he was fit to stand trial. Meanwhile, the media was in a frenzy to cover every angle of the son of Sam Story. This result is and the state of New York and acting what became known as the son of Sam laws permitting the state to confiscate the proceeds from any earnings made as proceeds of a crime for a period of five years after the act was committed. This money then goes to the victims of the crime. As it turns out, that was to be no trial.

Speaker 1:          15:08          Balco widths pled guilty to six counts of merger and refuse the edging of his attorney to claim a defense of insanity. He later status. I just wanted to end it and I was so distraught. I just confessed that guilty and got it over with and just wanted to get out of that environment during a sentencing, the mother of Stacy Moskowitz stood up and said, I could kill him with my bare hands and I am not a violent person. I could probably kill him and go for dinner and go to sleep that night. Trudy peacefully during Mrs Moskowitz's statements, Berkowitz repeated over and over that Stacy as a whole. Then he burst from his seat and made for the courtroom window. He was eventually restraints but not before knocking down several offices. Sentencing was delayed until June the 12th 1978 on which date he was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Balco. It's proved to be a problem prisoner. He reveled in tormenting other inmates because of his rage and other inmates referred to him as [inaudible]. On July the 10th, 1979 he was attacked by another inmate with a razor, the resulting neck injuries that required 57 stitches. After 10 years of confinement, Berkowitz became a born again Christian. There's angry mass kilo was converted into an evangelical passivist. He absorbed himself in a letter writing campaign to spread the message of the Bible. Over the years, uh, following developed around Berkowitz is the ultimate example of the changed man. The Modern Day equivalent of the Apostle Paul Berkowitz fest became eligible for parole in 2002, however, he sends a letter to the parole board requesting that the hearing be canceled. And as he stated, in all honesty, I believe that I deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life. I have with God's help long ago come to terms with my situation and I have accepted my punishment.

Speaker 1:          16:50          He has been up for parole every two years since 2002 but he has consistently refused the opportunity to see cause freedom as a result.
