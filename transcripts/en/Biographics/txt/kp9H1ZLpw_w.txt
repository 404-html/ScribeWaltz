Speaker 1:          01:36          Robin began by using comedy as a defense mechanism. It started with his mother. Lori had a very sharp wit and we'd often use humor and laced with sarcasm to communicate with her son in order to connect with that. Robin Hanson make his mother laugh. It wasn't good enough to be Robin. He had to be funny Robin, by the time he was 16, the family had relocated to California where Robin attended redwood high school.

While that was future Superman Christopher Reeve rave, who would become a close friend, recalled his first impressions. Upon meeting Williams, he wore a tie dye shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked to Marla minutes. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an Untied Balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in horror as he virtually chromed off the walls of the class and hallways. To say that he was on would be a major understatement. The juilliard. Well Robin, the heat astounded his teachers and fellow students alike. He was able to take on epicenter of characters with ease, trading out one accent or dialect for another, like he was born to do it, but with the Robin, he was frustrated at juilliard. He just didn't fit in. After two years, his teachers told him that there was nothing more that they could teach him. One of his instructors considered robin's via genius. He was not being properly served by schools conservative in its classical training style. He left juilliard in 1976 to launch himself onto the world.

He played a collection of rather edgy characters, including reverend oral satisfaction is only standup, was influenced by the likes of Lenny Bruce Peter Sellers and Jonathan winters is manage quickfire Adlib routines and off the wall, physical comedy proved an absolute hit anti soon established. A loyal following. Robin loves the immediate feedback that came with standup comedy and it was something that he would continue right through his career despite the apparent ease of his performances. He actually found stand up incredibly stressful underneath the cloak of exact. He wants an intensely shy man. He once said that he started using drugs and alcohol as a crutch to combat stage nuts in 1977 when he moved to Los Angeles where he began performing if a comedy club.

Speaker 1:          05:37          It was here that he was discovered by TV producer George Schlatter, who offered him a spot in a revival of the old sixties show.

He became, they send me regular cast member on the Richard Pryor show while also continuing perform standup. It was an appearance on the Richard Pryor show, the brought Williams to the attention of Gary Marshall, the producer of the hit Sitcom, happy days, often five years. This scripture, it says, while they were running out of ideas they, they hadn't yet jumped the shark. They decided to do an episode taking off the 19 sixties Scifi comedy. My favorite Martian, the episode when it was called my favorite organ and it called for the costing of an access to play an alien from the land of Org Marshall Thought Williams might be the man for the job in one has gone down as possibly the most brilliant audition in TV history, rubbing into the room and immediately sat in the chair on his hat.

Speaker 1:          06:32          He continued to do his lines and then broken Zune inspired Adlib Marshall. It cost him on the spot.

However, the character played by Williams mork from ork was such a hit with the TV watching audience after an initial broadcast that the ending was refilled. So mark was a real character. Once your Robbins' work on the happy days episode was improvised and augmented with physical comedy, audiences couldn't get enough of the Zany adient and demanded much more. This led to the creation of the spinoff series, Mork and mindy, which ran from 1978 to 1982. The show catapulted, Williams do absolute started literally overnight. After just two weeks on the APP. It had zoomed to the top 10 of the Nielsen Ratings, the producers of the show.

He also lived his life and the fastest of fast names. He quickly slipped into the habit of partying into the early hours, crawling home at five in the morning, and then having to be on set by 10:00 AM.

After four years, Mork and mindy had lost its midas touch, produces dried whatever they could to resurrect the initial appeal, but nothing seemed to work. They decided to make more, less naive, allowing Williams to work in more of his nightclub act material. Interestingly, the more character and also founded sway into his standup routines, though not by Robin's design audience members at late night shows, we'd simply yell out, do more, switch Robinwood, frustratingly responds, or mark's not here. I'm a different guy. By the middle of 1982, though, the character that had propelled Williams to superstar status was beginning to feel like a millstone around his neck, so it came as somewhat of a relief to him when mork and mindy was canceled.
