Speaker 1:          00:00          She put herself in danger in the pursuit of a good story. She uncovered wrongs, committed in society. She traveled around the world and she did it all in a time when women weren't expected to do anything beyond get married, have children, and take care of the home. She lives her life, very different men. She faced backlash, but she never backs down and she'd changed lives. Energy changed journalism forever. Well, he wants this courageous woman that would of course be nearly blind or women ahead of our time.

Speaker 2:          00:40          No,

Speaker 1:          00:41          though it's the name she's best known as today. Nellie Bly wasn't actually born as such. After birth in 1864 she was christened Elizabeth Jane Cochran and growing up she was indeed known by a different name altogether and that would be pink. She was a vibrant, energetic Charles. You've never shied from attention. Her mother encouraged her vivaciousness and allowed her to dress in bright colors. Most of the girls and women in her home town of Cochrane in Pennsylvania, we're wearing drab colors of brown, black, gray, and white, but it's pink. Stood out. She had to, she had 13 brothers and sisters. To contend with for attention after all. The town was actually named after blaze Father Judge Michael Cochran. Judge Cochran unfortunately passed away at an early age and Bly was only six years old when it happens. Per father did not have a will and his death left. The family impoverished.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Blaze mother remarried, but it's the marriage turned out to be a disaster and new husband's blind. Step father was a violent drunk when blinds mother had finally had enough of this mistreatment. She filed for divorce that's only 14 years old, but I was called upon to testify at the divorce trial. She had to speak up about what she had seen this violent man do and how he had mistreated her mother, true to her personality. Even then she was honest and witty even in what must have been an incredibly difficult situation for a young teenager. During the trial, she told the court, my stepfather has been generally drunk since he married my mother and when drunk he is very cross, he is cross save it to the whole law deal. Made an impression on Bly in the year where she was living in marriage was supposed to be the ultimate goal for a woman. Having seen how mother's experiences blind knew that marriage didn't always need a secure future or even happiness blinds. She decided that she was going to make her mark on the world all by herself.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Initially went to school for a career in teaching for a woman. That was one of the only career path is available at the time. She was a good writer, but she wasn't a good student. Then after only one semester, she couldn't afford the tuition and so her mother needed help at home, so she had to leave school. She moved with her mother and siblings to Pittsburgh where they ran a boarding house for income. Once a blight picks up a local newspaper and was a gas at column, she rat the title. It was enough to set her off because it was what girls are good for. The actual contents. Well, those what outright angering the column asserted that women were good for nothing. That's staying at home and giving birth and when it came to working women, well, the radical them, a monstrosity blind. She wasn't one to sit idly by and let something she disagreed with as much as this PA spine.

Speaker 1:          03:14          She drafted up a response using the pseudonym, lonely often girl. Her response caught the attention of the papers editor George Madden, but Ashley had risen. It's under a pseudonym. He had no way to identify and get in touch with blind. He was so impressed though that he didn't give up. He was an advertisement and the Pittsburgh dispatch asking Lingley often go to contacts and the paper and to reveal her identity and well, why did he do this? When he wants to give her a job by responding to the advertisements and was given the chance to write a column on a trial basis, after I call them was published in the Pittsburgh dispatch, not an highlighter for a full time job. While at the dispatch Cochran officially adopted the name that the world would come to remember. Of course that would be Nellie Bly. She worked for only $5 a week, but she had a platform to share her ideas about women's independence.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Lie also began the work that would make her famous outing social wrongs. As an undercover reporter. She combines the two messages by going undercover as a factory worker and writing an expo, say on the poor conditions that women faced as they tried to and pennies to help feed the families. Jolson writes about the unfair treatments of women who were in divorce proceedings. That topic, she knew a thing or two about us because of her mother's experience. Bonton and articles were controversial and advertisers don't like controversy. Sound familiar? They started to pull their ads from the dispatch and the publisher got nervous if she was going to cause problems for their bottom line. They didn't see the value in keeping Bly in this role. That was so atypical for a woman at the time, so they put a women writers usually works the fashion and society pages blind, wasn't really happy with this move in 1887 is only 23 years old.

Speaker 1:          04:46          She moved by herself to New York City. She didn't have a job, but when she went to the big city, in fact, she was unemployed for months. She wasn't willing to give up there and it's kept visiting offices and applying for work. After four months, she hit the Jackpot. The New York world offered to let her try out an assignment run by Joseph Pulitzer. The paper was a prominent publication as Bly. She was up to the job. One of our first assignments at the New York world's became her most famous. It also made a difference with the treatments of some of society's most vulnerable people in the late 19th century. The mentally ill were locked up and isolated from society. One place they were sent in New York was the women's lunatic asylum on Blackwell's island and blinds or editors. Well, they want you to get into that institution. She was eager to do so even though she didn't know how she was going to get out.

Speaker 1:          05:32          All she was told in preparation for this assignment was write up things as you find them good or bad. Give praise and blame as you think best as the truth. All the time. She spent days preparing, practicing facial expressions to make herself seem as out of it as possible. Then she went to a boarding house to spend the night. While there she pretended to be afraid of everything at the house. She spent hours just staring at the wall and saying nothing in shorts. She somebody did her best to act insane. It works and the head of the boarding house called the cops and Bly was taken away. The police had around analyzed by doctors at the Bellevue Hospital. Bly claims to have an easier and so case caught the attention of the media. They knew one recognized her as a journalist. Ultimately the doctors were able to recommends that this young pretty independently insane women, the committed to Blackwell island.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Now, even before she arrived at the asylum, she had her first bit of information for her expos. A asylums apparently weren't all that hard to get into. When she arrived at this observation was cemented for her as she knows other patients. He didn't seem to have all that much reason to be locked up and away from society once she was in the asylum blind. Did an act at all. She decided to just be herself and interestingly this didn't arouse suspicion at all. In fact, it actually did the opposite lay days are observed. The more seemingly I talked in actors, the crazier I was thought to be daily life. It was tough at the asylum. I was forced into cold barbs and was freezing. Most of the time that she was committed, my teeth shattered and my limbs were boost, flashed with blue and cold. Suddenly I got one after the other three buckets of water over my head, ice, cold water to and to my ears, my eyes, my nose and my mouth.

Speaker 1:          07:08          The food was horrific. Dirty water served alongside rotting meat grool ans nearly inedible bread. Patient states and areas surrounded by waste and with rats crawling around their fees. Their days were spent sitting on hard benches and some patients were even tied together in her initial newspaper reports and it's later in a published book. Bly described the horrific treatment of asylum patients and how it's might be making the patients even worse. She wrote what accepting torture would produce insanity quicker than this treatments. Here is a class of women sent it to be cured. I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability to take a perfectly sane and healthy women, shut her up and make us sit from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM on straight back benches. Did Not allow her to talk or move during these hours. Give her no reading and his letter, no nothing of the world or it's doing give her bad food and harsh treatment and see how long it will take to make her insane.

Speaker 1:          08:01          Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck, but I lasted 10 days of Blackwell islands. She was released when the paper contacted the asylum and asked for her release two weeks days and the piece was published in the New York worlds and it grabs the attention of the country. People were outraged and we're calling for change. Your grand jury was convened and Bly joins them in devising a series of changes that needed to be made at the asylum. The New York Department of charities and corrections had $1 million out into its budget to help with improvements to the facilities. The turnover oversaw and overall safer and more humane conditions and treatments were implemented at the asylums blind, the Caymus celebrity. She was praised for her bravery and her willingness to speak out about societal ills, but her work was far from over. Even with our fame, she keeps up undercover reporting.

Speaker 1:          08:44          The same year she went down to cover the asylum. Blind also went undercover for a piece of a lighter nature. She wants it to find out about the active industry in New York City, that sorts of fines, women husbands, she wrote, this has been getting interested me. I didn't know what to marry, but I was as interested as a little boy with a dynamites cartridge. On another occasion she wrote about a Sadden York industry baby buying and she indeed to come the New York government exposing the actions that were prominent lobbyist who was essentially bribing lawmakers. Nellie Bly had no shortage of topics to write on and is no shortage of courage. Do you drive a forward in her investigations but her appetite for adventure wasn't fully sated by writing articles about the CD goings on of New York City in 1888 she was 24 years old and she has an idea, she wants it to travel around the wells and she wants it to do it faster than Jewel's vins fictional character, affiliates fog.

Speaker 1:          09:34          And of course she wanted to write about it in the paper. Although she's proven herself from her past assignments, blight, it's still faced reticence from editors within working. It was quite difficult for the times. Women traveling by themselves was adding a new layer of defiance to the Norse. They wanted to send a man around the world and not nearly as she later wrote. The to her request was along the lines of it is impossible for you to do. It was the terrible verdicts in the first place. You are a woman and you would need a protector and even if it were possible for you to travel alone, you would need to carry so much baggage that it would detain you and making rapid changes besides you speak. Nothing but English, so there is no use talking about it. No one but a man. We can do this and so what was their response to this very well start the man and I'll start the same day if some other newspaper and to beat him.

Speaker 1:          10:20          It took a year but her is were eventually convinced that she could make the journey and that's I'm women traveled with suitcases full of clothes and we're often attended by escorts, but again showed that she was ahead of her time when the time came for her to depart on her trip around the world. In 1899 she boarded the ship or Augusta Victoria by herself and with only two small bags. She wore a since and I ever coached and kept a few $100 in a bag tied around her neck. The first part of our trip though it was tough, but I got seasick and couldn't hold down food. The only thing that made her feel better, we're sleeping. At one point she slept for so long that the ship's crew thought that she had died in our cabin. She landed in England's and went on to France in France.

Speaker 1:          10:58          She imagined Jewel's van, the man who inspired the trip from France. She traveled to Egypt, say long Hong Kong and Japan and China. She visited a lab colony along the way. She traveled to board ships and rickshaws and trains even riding horses when needed to back home in the United States. So readership was kept updated via telegraph. All the time, Bly was traveling the world. People were keeping a close eye on the dispatchers that she sends from abroad. They had more than a passing interest in her venture for van was a prize at stake if the New York world's and decided to make the most of blaze trip to drive up their audience and build their brands. They offered a trip to Europe for the person who was places to guessing and blinds returns. I'm starting points. People made guesses literally down to the seconds. Meanwhile, they were also following another trip around the world.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Upon hearing of blinds, stunts, arrival in New York newspaper decided they couldn't let the New York world to get all the attention, so they sent a female reporter of their own around the globe and there's the business left New York heading the opposite way, traversing the United States first before heading across the Pacific business, Lindsey took four days longer than Bli to travel the world. The final leg of blades global trip was across the Pacific Ocean. She made her way across the world's largest ocean on the RMS oceanic, but the ship hit rough weather on the crossing. Bly was two days later than she had plans for her arrival back to the u s she doesn't box in San Francisco and boarded a private train. Take her back to the east coast. 72 days after departing aboard a ship and Hoboken New Jersey, she was back not only hip, she'd beats in Phineas fogs fictional record.

Speaker 1:          12:23          She had set a world record of her own. Indeed Nellie Bly had once again proven. Her niece says wrong. She said, I always have a comfortable feeling that nothing is impossible if one applies a certain amount of energy in the right direction. When I want things done, which is always at the last moment, and as I am met with such an answer, it's too late. I hardly think it can be done. I simply say, nonsense. If you want to do it, you can do it. The question is, do you want to do it? Well, I published a book about her adventure and the New York world was happy with the increased attention they receive thanks to [inaudible], but apparently they were not happy to give blood a bonus insulted to this. She resigned. She didn't have a job, but she wasn't suffering quite the opposite. She had become a national celebrity, I religion name were worth money. So popular had she become with her adventure around the world and by this point she wasn't even 30 within three years of our departure. Then New York wealth. While they wanted her back, she started writing for the paper again in 1893 once again taking on investigative assignments and these assignments had the goal of reaching out corruption and miss treatments.

Speaker 2:          13:33          No,

Speaker 1:          13:34          although she had always said that she had no plans to Mary and had Indeed's lived out her life in defiance of the expectations of women by eventually matter man and decided to settle down. In 1995 she met and married a 73 year old man. Lied was just 31 oh husband's Roger Seaman was the head of the iron class manufacturing industry. Marriage doesn't mean that blight was ready to become a housewife and it's not work. Quite the opposite. In fact, she started to get involved with the manufacturing company offering designs for products and helping oversee its operations to of the designs she created with a company with passengers and Milka cat and then the garbage can. In 1896 she quits working for the New York world's to focus more of our time. The ironclads manufacturing company. When her husband died in 1904 she even took over as its president how time in that role and lasted less than a decade as the company filed for bankruptcy in 1911 when the company failed blind jumps right back into what she knew best and that was reporting the women's suffrage movement was in full swing.

Speaker 1:          14:26          Man's Bly wrote about the marches and calls for the vote in the latter half of the 1910s she covered world war one giving her another groundbreaking title. She was the first female war correspondent in the United States, fully back into journalism. She got her own column in The New York Journal in 1919 but sadly her sounds are writing. Didn't last long. In 1922 when she was only 57 years old, blind contracted pneumonia. The oldest would prove to be the only thing that keep her down on January the 27th 1922 by lost her life to pneumonia at saint Mark's hospital in New York City. Physically, the next day's edition. If the evening journal Coulter, the best reporter in America,

Speaker 2:          15:12          no Danny Bly

Speaker 1:          15:13          was a trailblazer. Not just for women, but for all journalists are writing made a difference in people's lives affecting change in government and inspiring and lighting people's imaginations from an early age. She showed great courage. She knew what she wants it and she went for it. That doing nothing, especially not the fact that she was a woman stand in our way. How she was a writer, perhaps her own words sum up her life best. I said I could and I worked and I did so I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.
