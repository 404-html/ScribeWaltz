Punch Aveo was one of the most divisive figures in history to millions. He was the Mexican or Robin Hood, but to others he was a ruthless terrorist who kills without conscience. What is without a doubt is that he rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous Mexicans in history playing a vital role in the decades that shaped modern Mexico. In this week's biographics, we discover the real story of Pancho via,

Speaker 1:          00:42          there's a lot of mystery surrounding the early life of the man who became Pancho via most historians believe that he was born on the 5th of June, 1878 in the tiny village of Rancho Delacroix Tada in the state of Durango and Mexico. His birth name was Jose Dora, Teo Aramco Aramco gala. When he was a few years old, his father I boost in Aramco died. This meant that authority, Teo, the oldest of five children have to start working on the Hacienda, getting up at three o'clock in the morning. He had to walk for 10 miles to start work at five. His work consisted of planting corn and running errands via laser. Claims that he never attended a day of school and his entire life. When not working, you'd like to play cards and it was often getting into fights with his peers. During his teen. He held a number of odd jobs including and mule Skinner brick layer runs and butch up.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Then at the age of 16 you moved to Chihuahua for work. The story goes that two years later he returned to his hometown in order to hunt down a man named or Gustin Lopez and a greater who had raped his sister. He apparently found the rapist and kills him. This episode is said to have set him on his life of crime. He fled to the Sierra Madre Mountains and joined a group of bandits. Changing his name to puncture via the bands had soup numbers between 40 and 50 man rated the ranches of the wealthy in order to steal castle and horses. They lived in the mountains and they train. Does guerrilla fighters, their reputation as fighters against the system established them as freedom fighters in the minds of the poor who gave them shelter and warn them when the local police, when we begin in 1902 via was captured by the police according to the practice of the times, he was inducted into the federal army.

Speaker 1:          02:17          He spent several months in the army and then dessert is heading back to the hills to rejoin his gang. Around this time, he actually kills an army officer, which made him one of the most wanted men in northern Mexico. A reward of 10,000 pesos was placed on his hat pantry became the leader of his band Dyk group and it's continued to lead increasingly violent raids upon the wealthy. Legend says that he would risk capture by openly walking through the streets of shower to distribute money to the poor. In so doing, he won the loyalty of the people who helps protect them from the authorities.

Speaker 1:          02:53          In 1910 Mexico's seemed to be a model of democratic stability. Porfirio Diaz had the president for 30 years and the country was celebrating a hundred years of independence, but Diaz rules with an iron fist and the elections that were held every four years, they were just a facade. In order to appease foreign governments. 90% of people in Mexico lived in poverty since 1906 there had been a number of worker rebellions against the conditions that they were forced to exist under. Each one had been forcibly put down by the Diaz regime. A number of intellectuals began writing against this regime, including a man named Francisco Madero. He decided to run for president in 1910 what his campaign began to gather momentum. However, President Diaz had Mindera arrested and thrown in prison. The mock election went ahead and Diaz was reelected for the seventh time, but Arrow managed to escape from prison and he fled to the United States.

Speaker 1:          03:45          From that, he began planning for the revolution. Meanwhile, down in Chihuahua pantry via had established a kind of reputation as this Mexican Robin Hood figure, a champion of the underprivileged, but he was also known to be a wild man. He was a ruthless killer who would shed blood with utter impunity seeking respectability. He met with a supporter of Francisco Madeira by the name of Abraham Gonzalez by aligning himself with Madeira. Gonzalez told Pancho that he would be able to reinvent himself as a legitimate man of the people. They, uh, agreed GNC through the support of his bandage group behind this revolutionary cause. By now, panacea developed a strong hatred for the Diaz regime along with the landowners and the police who had been hunting him for more than a decade. He and his men brought skills to the revolution records that had been hones over years of rating, fighting and debating the authorities in battle.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Pancho fought like a man possessed. And now that he added an established cause, he was even more ferocious. He also proved himself to be a master of military tactics, brilliantly marshaling his small band against much larger governmental forces on one occasion of the battle of Escobar's pantry. But hat's upon planted sticks and it'll just a full of the opposition into thinking that he had a much larger army than he actually did buy. The beginning of 1911 though that me, it had grown to 400 people and it was racking up to slice of victories over the federal army. In early 1911 there was a challenge to the revolutionary leadership of Madeira from the ultra radical Mexican liberal party to put down the challenge, but they wrote turns, a Pancho who moved in and arrested the leaders of the Party, the grateful Madeira rewarded via by making him a kernel of his revolutionary army.

Speaker 1:          05:21          In May, 1911 zero is 3000 strong force with villa at the forefront laid siege to the border city of Sia. Dot. Horace, the town was gutted by 500 federal troops along with 300 civilian auxiliaries and local police. The fighting went on for two days and at the end the federal police surrendered on May the 25th with his armies being defeated and public opinion unanimously against him. President DNS resigns and fled into exile. A free and fair election was housing, which Francisco Madero was elected presidents, Madeira. He signed the Treaty of [inaudible] by which the federal law me would remain in place. He therefore disbanded the rebel. Armenians ordered to returns. They're pretty wild lives, but Arrow allowed the structure of the DNS government to remain to Banjo via this was a fatal error. Bands, he let his feelings be known. He told Maduro, you have destroyed the revolution. It's simple. This bunch of Dandies of made a fool of you and this will eventually cost us on next, including yours.

Speaker 2:          06:20          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:23          VM and his fellow revolutionaries were also incense that Madeira refuse to distribute, sees hacienda land to veterans of the struggle is payments for the services they rendered via became increasingly critical of Madeira is actions, especially his putting a former supporter of deposed president Dan says, minister of war. Even more outspoken was a fellow revolutionary leader by the name of Pascoe al or Roscoe and March of 1912 or Roscoe led a rebellion against the new regime. The Dero called on Via to put it down, just like being a judge, devolving Orozco to join the revolts panel showed that his army of 400 in conjunction with federal forces in a series of decisive victories that crushed the rebellion following the victory against a row. Vias bans joins up with federal militia in the city of tare on in the state of Quito. The federal commands a General Victoria on a request out to tested via, he was initially welcoming though showering him with praise and awarding him an honorary general ship, but the pleasantries they didn't last long with quieter accusing pound show of stealing a horse with his honor in question via responded by slapping the general.

Speaker 1:          07:25          This was the pretext that quota was off to NZ promptly hand via arrested and charged with insubordination and execution by firing squad was ordered. Word of this affair reached President of Madeira who telegraph clatter and ordered him to not execute via but to keep him as a prisoner via was sent. Do you bet on prison in Mexico City while incarcerated that he runs a region right under the guidance of a fellow prisoner. In June, he was transferred to a prison in Santiago. Six months later though he escaped jumping on board a train bound for the United States. On January the second 1913 he arrived in El Paso, Texas, while in prison, penetrate learns of a plant coup against Madero. Hey, I attempted to get a warning message through to the president, but it didn't arrive in time. On February the 22nd 1913 Dario was gunned down on the orders of general quarter.

Speaker 1:          08:12          The man who had come so close to executing via just a year earlier question now installed himself as the new president of Mexico via was incensed that the series of events, even though he had become disillusioned with his actions upon gaining power, he still viewed Madeira as the apostle of democracy and just personal role model. Now the Cueto his personal enemy was in, he knew that he had to return to Mexico. He indeed felt that the mantle of completing the dream of democracy the Madeira had instilled in him was now upon his shoulders. Okay, so now just before we get into vias, really brutal phase of life, it's time for me to quickly tell you about scripts.

So script with that unlimited plan is perfect for my goal. Also, I'm reading more magazines time Macworld Inc. It's incredible what you can get for any $8 and 99 cents a month. I don't really know how they do it for any $8 and 99 cents a month because I certainly feel that books are more expensive than that audio book certainly are. I even think some magazines probably more expensive than $8 a month, so I said how they do it, but it's a good deal. Now, a book that was essential in creating this video was the mega in depth of the life and times of Pancho villa and you can grab that on the script if you want more or personally, I've been reading a book called the innovators, which is entirely unrelated to this video, but it's actually amazing and I couldn't not bring it up.

Speaker 1:          09:51          Like I said, I'm trying to read 20 books and this is one of them. It's all about people who created the Internet and computers, the innovators.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Except for the wealthy businessmen who were sort of relieved by this return to order the vast majority viewed quarter as a jackal who had stolen the presidency. In March of 1913 Pancho via returns in Mexico, intense on avenging the murder of Madeira and relieving his country of the tyranny of quieter. He later recalled that night I had eight men with me and we had no definite plan, but I decided to make for my old haunts in the Sierra Madre mountains where I knew I could find men to follow me. We had one sack of flour, two small packages of coffee and some salts. That's was all our food supply. Of course, we were all well armed, but had little ammunition via small bands, began making lightning raids upon the federal forces that were garrison did northern Mexican towns and forts. Slowly they were able to accumulate the arms and supplies that they needed within a week.

Speaker 1:          11:11          Vias, bans, it's groans or more than a hundred men. And within three months it had morphed into a legitimate army of 18,000 troops in battle. The uh, proved to be ruthless is standard policy was to kill. Prisoners are lucky if you would only be spared by the intervention of his left hand. It's in contrast to this brutal side of his nature. They Pancho who had a strong social conscience for two months. In 1913 he held the position of governor of Chihuahua. He expropriated lands from the wealthy to distribute to the poor, opened at several schools and enacted laws to protect widows and orphans. On Christmas Day 1913, he gathered the poor of Gor together and gave them each 15 pesos. They subtractions. He became the hero and the savior of the underclass. By 1914 they had control over the northern parts of Mexico. I'm thinking over the governorship to his left tenancy began the march south to Mexico City.

Speaker 1:          12:01          You are quiet or sat in the presidential chat as he swept, Southie conquered everything in his weight, gaining a reputation as the center of the north. By June, his arm, he had grown to 50,000 most of whom were riding on horseback by now. It was a fully fledged army with mobile hospitals and recruits from other countries including the United States. At the head of this, the largest revolutionary army and the history of the Americas stood Pancho via Lido with great charisma who at the same time as the respect and fear rivers Madden and developed a military strategy that proved enormously successful day and night. He would pour a continuous frontal assaults against the enemy lines supported by cavalry troops. The attacks were continually ruling with troops of the France being replaced by those behind this gave the defenders and no time to rest resulting in them almost always being overwhelmed by this sustained form of attack via also established offices within his army is similar to governmental departments.

Speaker 1:          12:58          He had an office of foreign affairs who were particularly focused on reaching out to President Woodrow Wilson for USAID. His financial committee made contact with wealthy landowners to assure them that they would not be mistreated once a victory was achieved. The United States provided aid to the revolutionary cause. Three around about means via sold livestock and other products to the u s which provided the funds with which to purchase American weapons and ammunition. It was this flow of weaponry. This enabled the rebel army to match up to the federal forces in recognition of the aid being received from north of the border via ensured that no American property was confiscated. Positive Press and the American media resulted with the Washington Times reporting in January of 1914 via is carrying on a campaign of modern and humane wharf APP. The media sort of fell in love with via with one editor.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Writing Vr is without the possibility of any doubt the greatest leader Mexico has ever had. His method of fighting is astonishing. Like Napoleon's via instituted some telling innovations in Mexican warfare. He was the first to leave the women and children behind and forced the pace of his army with raids marching far away from his face. He would abandon his supply trains and had far out in search of the enemy. He was also the first stage of nighttime attacks, which became especially devastating to the enemy. In the spring of 1914 the two key cities of Toryonn and Zach, a k test were taken. These victories brought the regime to its knees with quite a fleeing into exile. On July the 14th, 1914, the federal army collapsed to leaving the revolutionary step, fill the vacuum into the presidency. Now stabbed Veneziano, Carranza raw former Hacienda Rhona who brought his forces into Mexico City. I had a via, yet it was penetrating the, uh, who was the hero of the revolution. Wherever he went, people would yell out via

Speaker 1:          14:48          via. And his fellow revolutionary leader is a potter joined forces to Alice Carranza, who they had never intended to take the helm on December the sixth, 1914, the road to the head of 50,000 men along sides apart or with his 15,000. By then grounds, a hood is naturally flat. The capital [inaudible] was now at the height of its power wearing a navy blue suit and to cap with the Eagle of the Mexican flag on us. He rode through the city as the masses turned out to shower him with praise. He went to the presidential palace and sat on the presidential chair, but only long enough to have his picture taken. He never served as the president of Mexico, although he could have easily won an election. At that time, a council between the various fighting factions failed to bring a consensus and via continue to lead his army against the pockets of rebellion. Alvaro Obregon was a supporter of Carranza who won a series of decisive battles against vias. Army Pancho was outsmarted by Abra gone and many of his men were killed. He was forced to retreat to his base and the northern Sierra Maestra mountains. In a few months if fierce fighting the invincible Ami that had marched into Mexico City had been reduced to a ragtag mob of just a few hundred men.

Speaker 1:          16:02          The change now came over Pancho via his violent streak. It was fully unleashed in San Pedro de la quaver. He brought all of the men in town into the middle of the town and killed them all personally shooting the local priest in the hat. Then in Santa Isabella, he shot several American minors. The Americans, they now distance themselves from via. Recognize the re-instituted Cameron's and government. At around four in the morning on March the ninth of 1916 via the incense, the President Wilson had legitimize the Koran's and government let a force of 100 men across the border into the town of Columbus, New Mexico. They're tacked the town of 600 inhabitants from four directions using indiscriminately as well as the looting and burning buildings via however had chosen the wrong town. The 13th us cavalry was stationed there with four machine guns and 400 highly trained soldiers. The majority of his men were killed.

Speaker 1:          16:52          The bus via managed to get away, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The American response to the unprovoked Columbus attack was an overwhelming at 10,000 troops being sent on trains south of the border with the single objective of capturing Poncho via the head of the American forces was John Passion that his troops along with Apache Indian scouts 350 miles across the border and such a via into every village that he weds Pershing would yell out where his Poncho via every time though the locals would provide him with false information. On several occasions, portions of Pershing's army skirmished with via and his tiny bands. On one occasion, Pancho was shot in the leg in April. The American newspapers actually reported that he had died as a result of the leg being infected. The reality though was the pantry was still very much alive though badly wounded and hiding out in a cave in the Sierra Madre is Pershing's expedition in managed to capture weaponry and horses, but it failed in its objective of bringing pantry with the Americans having withdrawn via reverted to his gorilla fighting ways. He's still that the support of the people and was determined to continue fighting against horrendous regime. Then in 1920 with another coup in the offing president's Carranza was killed as he fled to the Gulf of Mexico with the national treasure VM. Saw this turn of events is his opportunity to come to a peace settlement with a new regime he rode for 13 days to a city where he telegraph the new president Adolfo Dlo Cata requesting an amnesty. Quite agreed grateful that the threat of a via overthrow was nullified

Speaker 1:          18:27          via was given a 25,000 acre farm in Canada tear. He brought 200 of his men with him who immediately got to work on improving the rundown property in a short amount of time. This area was tend to do a communist had a school and it grew wheat and corn and bean crops. They were able to support the large community via got up each day to supervise the work and spend time in the school house. Peep hardly bevel left the farm because he was fearful of being assassinated. On the morning of July the 20th 1923 via did leaf his ranch. He went to parral to visit one of his wives and to withdraw money to pay his work. It's as, as dodge vehicle was driving through eight deserted part of town, dozens of snipers opened up filling the car with more than 40 bullet holes. Nine of these bullets, they entered pantry fee.

Speaker 1:          19:10          His body, his death was instantaneous. Yet even in death, Viet did not find peace. Three years after his burial and parral whose tomb was ransacked, the corpse was removed with the head being cut off. Souvenir hunters also took pieces of the coffin and some of his bones. In 2010 the Wall Street Journal reported that his right index finger was being offered at a pawn shop in El Paso. The asking price $9,500 so I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
