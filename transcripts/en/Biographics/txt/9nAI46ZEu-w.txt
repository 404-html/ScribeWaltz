Speaker 1:          00:00          Heads up everybody. There's going to be Japanese pronunciations in this one. I'm not Japanese. I don't always get it at 100% right. I do try though. Let's get into it. On march the 20th 1995 five members of Japan's Aum, Shinrikyo cult boarded to the Tokyo subway in the middle of rush hour. That's ATM. They punctured bags of Seren releasing a deadly cloud of nerve gas into the crowded trains. Commuters were blinded, racked with spasms, some choke to death on their own blood trapped underground with no, it's run. Some 6,000 people were aghast at bright spring day and 13 of them died. The attack was ordered by omes founder Yoga Instructor Shakara I Sahara a blinds mistake. 100 had leveraged his intense personal charisma into massive wealth creating a religious embar worth $1 billion, but where most of Angeles use their money to build churches. I Sohara used his to build an Ami under his watch on stockpile of chemical weapons. They bred deadly viruses. They infiltrated the Japanese authorities purchasing attack, helicopters, building weapons of mass destruction and drawing up plans to destroy the worlds. They were the single most ambitious cult that has ever existed and they committed all of their crimes while hiding in plain sight. In the video today, the remarkable story of the man who nearly brought about Armageddon,

Speaker 1:          01:32          one of the overriding features of these videos is just how many of us subjects come from humble circumstances. Shocker Sahara, he was born new difference born in the Kumomoto prefecture or on March the second 1955 he was one of just nine children that his poor mother bore pour in. This case does have a double meaning. Aside from all that childbirth, they were totally broke. All of their income came from their Dad's part time work as a traditional weaver, which was barely enough to support a one man, let alone a large family, but that's a horror at this point. It's still known by his birth name, Cheese Matsumoto. He adds an additional disadvantage. He was blinds. One Eye's vision was completely gone while the others was impaired, shipped off to a state run school for the blind's. It's only six years old. The young boy seemed destined by fate for hardship.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Only faith doesn't count it on one thing as a horror, as charisma, ferociously intelligence as a horror was noted by his teachers for the almost demagogic sway that he had over other students. His voice was like a weapon, but that was something else that is teachers noted to, as a horror, had a violence side hurting others. It was something of a game. Damn one SAS, a horror had decided you were the enemy. He would do everything in his power to make you suffer. Despite these early warnings, though, shocker, graduated in 1975 with all the trappings of a deeply ordinary man, he failed the tests to get into law and medical school and settled for studying acupuncture, relocating to Cheba Prefecture, just south of Tokyo. He opened his own practice selling medicines and that was kind of it, at least for a few years. And 1978 as a horror married his sweetheart Tomako to settle down to making babies.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Even as a horror is conviction. In 1982 for selling fake cures couldn't shake how fundamentally boring as life was. However, things were about to get very, very interesting. In the early 1980s Japan's economy had become the single biggest on earth. With this expansion, it came a tidal wave of soulless consumerism. The results of this was a generation of Japanese desperate to locate some meaning in their lives. So the beginning around 1980 a whole load of new religion started cropping up. So you feed the wealthy nations, impoverished sols, and one of these was Aegon shoe. It makes your of Buddhism and Hinduism, they go on to shoe, had been around since 1954 but it's popularity excluded when the government recognized it as an official religion in 1981 like thousands of others. Shocker Asara was sucked in by its teachings becoming a devout member. But rather than gaining enlightenment, I Sohara gained something even better.

Speaker 1:          04:01          He got an idea like an American rubber baron watching the first piece of railroad track being laid as a Horah divine's the new religions where the future ends. Well, he wanted a piece of the action, so he left. I go on a shoe, the engineer had a spiritual crisis that allows them to a Benz and Tomoko and the children and go to India for two years to study religious texts. When he finally returned in 1994 he was ready in some time without Yass a horror founded own Shinzen. No Chi quickly renamed alm Shinrikyo he changed his name to shock and awe Sohara and it's began handing out leaflets on Tokyo street corners and preaching his new religion. So there's a blinds, men NOCONA shouting about gold. Surely the busy people of Tokyo would have just laughed at him and walked on. Right? Well, not exactly do remember the shock. Jasa Haro was one of the most charismatic talkers ever born. A guy who could even give Hitler a run for his money like it. He's soon put his go to given gift to diabolical use.

Speaker 1:          05:06          So at this point we really need to ask ourselves what, what was on Shinrikyo when, what did they believe? Well, it's actually kind of hard to say now. Officially the religion was a Knicks of Christianity, End Times theology, Hindu creation myths and Buddhism, Yoga and Nostradamus, his prophecies. Well apparently whatever else that's a harder had lying around beneficially though. Um, had it one tenant making us a horror king as devise virus, a hierarchy and structure was designed to make him rich while quickly and effectively brainwashing everyone that the cults got its claws into like Scientology, at forced members to pay for access to higher spiritual plane, often making people sign over their entire fortunes. Unlike Scientology, it also put it in Steve Ots through extreme pain designed to break their will on rituals. They ranged on a scale of just plain nuts to holy hell. What hell is going on?

Speaker 1:          05:58          Followers were made to drink as a harbor is blood and daddy bath water. They underwent ordeals of being plunged into boiling water. It's a purifying their souls, the practice that led to many burns and even one death. Some were locked up in isolation. Rooms for days on end of us were force fed, hallucinogenic drugs. Above all this floated. The specter of us are Horab sometimes literally follow is believed he could levitate for hours at a time and that he was capable of reading their minds. They revered him as a living go onto reincarnation of Christ or Buddha and the Hindu god of destruction. Lord Shiva all rolled into some sort of Super God given now utterly bizarre. All of this, as you might expect to hear that home attracted a few hundred loonies are best, but oh boy, would you be wrong. As a horror, he was a gifted.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Advertise them. He recruited only from the upper middle classes of Japanese society targeting the well qualified and rich giving only the aura of an exclusive club, albeit one that would a robe. You blinds as Omega three rich, it's reaching creased, sucking in more of the young and alienated. It helps that 1986 markets at the start of the bubble economy. When Japan became phenomenally wealthy, not that own was confined to Japan. Influential Russians began to join as the decades dragged home. Even Germans who were recruited and send American Brown shape, and by the late 1980s own was perhaps the biggest of Japan's new religions. As a Haro was surrounded by 10,000 devoted followers on compounds that sprawled outside of Tokyo and in skyscrapers rented downtown, I would leave. He told the public he was a new guru spreading a peaceful message in private. He told his confidence that one day he would be the king of Japan as his influence grew as a hauler is bullying ways they were sentenced.

Speaker 1:          07:42          He still owns it, forcing own members to practice extortion and even kidnapping. There in relatives, friends, some money. This is money was laundered through a network of yoga centers and computer shops that the group established with the help of the Yakuza and 1999 the Tokyo metropolitan government. It finally granted the religion legal status, even as a horror, began preaching antisemetic conspiracy theories and saying Americans must be kills. Some said that and infiltrated the government itself, bending the law to it's well as the sun on Japan's most hedonistic decade. That's a horror was in a pretty good place. He was rich with the religion worth a cool one, billion American dollars. He was also worshiped by thousands of people about that. It wasn't enough for the poor boy from Kumamoto Prefect jet. He wanted to rule millions and he didn't care if he had to kill to make as squalor dreams come true.

Speaker 1:          08:36          It started with our eyes. It was 11:00 PM on June the 27th of 1994 Yoshiyuki conoce wife began complaining of vision problems. The Kona is where a typical Japanese upper middle class couple of living in the leafy kg height suburb of Madison, Modo surrounded by doctors and lawyers and judges that they fall night though the security of their expensive neighborhood. It didn't save them, barely had Yoshiyuki guns and check on his wife. Then she fell to the ground suffering spasms and foaming at the mouth as the salesman panics. Little did he knew that all across their street, others were collapsing to dying before their loved one's eyes. In all that commotion, No one noticed the van driving quietly away. The van was registered to arm Shinrikyo. This van I saw horror had ordered modifying to emis clouds of deadly nerve gas, the 1994 and that's a moto incident, killed eight people and left 500 injured.

Speaker 1:          09:27          It was the first major terrorist action by Oh and the first terrorist attack ever carried out with siren, but it didn't come from nowhere. Over the last half decade. Ahmed metamorphosed from Amea Doomsday cults into one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations on earth. The Ross had started back in 1989 just as Tokyo was recognizing it isn't official religion. That February, a young man named Shuji tag Gucci hat trying to leave the cult rather than let them go as a horror, ordered him strangled to death. No long off relatives of all members that banded together to find a police complaints. A young lawyer named Tsutsumi sack a moto took the case and lead to disappear in November, along with his wife and their newborn baby at laser emerge that all members had beaten all three of them to death and buried their bodies in a forest. When police investigated home sympathizers on the force destroyed evidence that could have convicted as a horror by now as a whole row was on his way to becoming a Japanese. Charles Manson completes with a dodgy bid and hack us, but one event was about to send him further into murderous insanity. This even Manson could have only dreamed of.

Speaker 1:          10:35          In February, 1990 Japan went to the polls to elect a new governments as Sohara made sure 24 own members were on the ballot. This would be the first step in his plan to become king once Almaden to the Japanese Diet that you know, stopping them. That was just one tragic flaw with this. The public did not like option Rikkyo one little bit. When the results came in Ohms, 24 candidates at scraped together a lousy 1,700 votes given mom had nearly 10 times as many adherence. This was a seriously pathetic outcome. Overnight as a, I became the laughing stock of Tokyo. Now in an ideal, well this is where as a horror story would end, but here's the thing about laughingstocks humiliating them. It's rally the ends as the often misattributed quote goes first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

Speaker 1:          11:24          And with his dreams of being king shattered as a horror, it was now ready to fight. He started by modifying his prophecies. He now told followers the world would end the following, a chemical weapon attack in 1995 evac job when I was to make that attack happen. So alm change tack, they began using members who worked in government labs to stockpile botulism anthrax. They sent a team to Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo to collected Bola. They started selling illegal drugs, fund their activities, hiring the Yakuza to provide the muscle. Within two months of the elections, all launched their first attack using the modified van. The group released botulism into the air outside of the Japanese Diet. The attack fails because they used a harmless strain pattern that would repeat two years later when they tried to spray anthrax over Tokyo from the top of a skyscraper. Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for their experiments with Seran back in. Kc Hides the Asha you could call know called the police, begging them to save his wife. Instead they arrested him and charged him with using Seren to killers, neighbors. We can only imagine how as a higher must have laughed to himself when he heard the news. It was in 1994 and only seemed invincible

Speaker 1:          12:38          in the nine months between the Matsumoto incidents and the Tokyo subway attack. Ohm went certifiably insane by now. The group was convinced doomsday was mayor months away, that the world was out to get them and that they needed to act fast to bring about the apocalypse. The tails of that time are so crazy that that seemed like fantasy. If we didn't know that they were true. There's the way I'm set up his own factory dedicated to producing AK 47 the way they managed to steal plans for constructing tanks and heavy artillery from a military contractor the way they successfully smuggled and attack helicopter into Japan from Russia as his army ants. Fire power grew, so did us. A horror is boldness. In late 1994 he ordered the assassination of an ex cultist with VX, the same chemical weapon used by North Korea to assassinate Kim Jong moons dissident brother.

Speaker 1:          13:26          In 2017 in February of 1995 he ended at Japanese official kidnaps and incinerated alive and a specially built oven that same month he ordered his troops do summarily executed nine old members. He suspected of disloyalty. All nine were hanged and coordinators with the ashes being thrown in a lake, and believe me, it gets even crazier. In 1993 Ahmed purchased a ranch in Australia that was home to a uranium mine. By 1994 they were actively planning to extract the uranium and build a dirty bomb. There's even some evidence the cults plan to attack in New York's World Trade Center. In short, I'm in early 1995 was a military fighting force prepared to do battle and die for that leader with Japanese authorities still turning a blind eye to the group. They could probably have carried out any number of atrocities that, as a horror, hadn't forgotten his prophecy. He had said five days ago that the world would end with chemical weapons and knew how to make it happen.

Speaker 1:          14:22          Now it's on their Australian ranch. Cultists for all of them had been testing increasingly deadly types of siren on sheep. As production moved to that Japanese compounds, the group now had enough of the Nazi nerve gas to kill millions of people. They just needed somewhere to release it, to bring about the apocalypse and that's somewhere was of course the Tokyo subway in March of 1995 as a horror took five of his followers aside as Eg Hirosi Toro, Toyota Masato Yaki Yammer. Yes, who you are. Hi Yoshi and decor you high listened attentively. That master spelled out his grand plan in a few days' time old within the world and they would have the honor of being as a horror is five horsemen of the apocalypse.

Speaker 1:          15:08          7:30 AM on March the 20th 1995 30 year olds can eg Hirosi. You got on board to the Tokyo subway is Marinucci line headed for Sucky Igi station, a shy young man with the Dorky pair of glasses and as an umbrella cluttered in one hands. No one paid any attention to him as he took a seat and placed a plastic bag on the floor shortly before 8:00 AM is the train ends at the government districts. Hirosi calmly tapped his umbrella twice, puncturing his plastic bag. He got up and Texas is vanishing into the morning muscle. Just another face in the anonymous Tokyo crowd across the subway network. Toyota Yaka Yammer ruins the too high he she is. We're doing the exact same thing. It never even occurred to anyone to stop them as heroes. He's trained lurched off to its next destination. Someone noticed a funny smell, chemical whiff as the train rolled on, commute is trapped inside, began to fill ill to notice them vision and giving funny.

Speaker 1:          15:58          By the time it pulled in to the next station, it was clear that something was seriously wrong as Esea. 2:00 AM the first alarm went up on the heavier line drain poisoned by. So hey you, she people were vomiting blood. Others were having fits as the news of the problem reached the subway authorities. They made a fateful decision. They decided to shut down the effective lions. The results was Sarah unfilled trains becoming stuck between stations, the people on board traps and like wraps and a deadly box. As the gas seeps out to fill first cars then trains. Hundreds of people were poisons and then thousands with nowhere to run. Survivors panicked, desperately trying to escape death in those black and claustrophobic tunnels. At one station, three subway employees bravely tried to remove a Sarah and package by hands within minutes. Two of them were dad. As commuters ran for the surface.

Speaker 1:          16:44          They brought the siren with them, clinging to their clothes like a disease. It spread from person to person poisoning. Thousands more bodies piled up in the streets outside of stations. Paramedics who ran to treat the wounded were themselves affected. That nervous systems attacked by an invisible killer. In that morning's carnival of Horace Mann, he would go blinds. Many would suffer brain damage and many would die. It was the bloodiest day. Japan's capital. How to work in too. Since the firebombing of Tokyo in 1945 at that moment, it must have really seems like the end of the world are truly arrived. Luckily, he has a horror. He had already seen the seeds of its own downfall. Do you remember that whole Matsumoto incident from about five minutes ago when own poison, that entire suburb with Seran? Well, Hiroshi Merita had been on the front lines treating that attack and had since become Japan's leading authority on Sarah and poisoning.

Speaker 1:          17:32          When news broke from Tokyo about a mysterious gas poisoning commuters, he immediately put two and two together with frightening speed. He frantically called in, faxed every single hospital in Tokyo, sending them detailed instructions for treating Seren poisoning. Since Aaron can take hours to kill or disable you, it's thought of Marita's actions saved many lives, but not all of them. By the time the sunsets on Japan's Day of terror, 12 people would debt, dozens have been permanently disabled and somewhere in the region of 6,000 people had been poisoned 10 years after the attack. It would be estimated that around 30% of those injured, we're still suffering with the effects of Sarah and poisoning. One study claimed that 60% of those gas experienced permanent damage for Japanese authorities. The Tokyo subway attack. It was a wake up call. There was no longer any doubt to there's um, we're involved in to know amounts of friends in the police could save a Sahara. Now it was time to take down the cultist

Speaker 1:          18:35          the days after on siren attack. We're living through a dream less than 48 hours after Kenichi Hirosi punctured his bag of Seren, a series of coordinated police raids, saw alm, compounds rated, and 200 cultists arrested facilities for producing Seren mustard gas. Anthrax and Vieques was seized along with enough weapons to start a war shocked by the southern police attention. The cult hit back hard. On march the 30th, the head of the National Police Agency was shot and nearly killed mine home assassin. Two weeks later to sympathize sympathizers released a cloud of fostering gas at the Oklahoma station, injuring 400 people. But it wasn't until may the fifth that I'm really trying to get their revenge. That morning of cyanide bomb was left below, add dockets in some Juku station. There was enough gas in it to kill 20,000 people through shift fluke, the designator malfunctions and it wouldn't be Tokyo's lost and miss.

Speaker 1:          19:25          Well, may the 16th 1995 [inaudible] was finally found hiding inside of fake wall and oms headquarters. Although he was arrested, the attacks didn't stop. His 13 year old daughter Rico was made leader and instituted a reign of shocking abuse and torture that surpassed even a father that same evening, and I'm not a bomb, nearly killed the governor of Tokyo. Finally on July the fourth 1995 not four months after the subway attack ohms, last gasp came for hydrogen. Cyanide bombs were left and subway stations across Tokyo. Together they would have killed somewhere in the region of 100,000 people, but once again, those detonators failed broken by repeated raids. Their teenage dictator now taken into care on scattered the groups, high ranking members. They all went on the run scattering to the four winds. The last fugitive member wouldn't be captured until 2000 and 12,000 [inaudible]. It was the end of the line.

Speaker 1:          20:17          Has Trial began in 1996 just as the one rich on declared bankruptcy. It lasted an incredible eight years for the first four years as a higher ed disrupted proceedings by making long, rambling speeches, claiming a miracle would see them. That's even as legendary charisma. It couldn't help him. Now in 2000 to Sro seemed to recognize this and do you fell silent. He wouldn't speak again for the rest of his life. In 2004 as a hydro is finally sentenced to death by hanging is law has failed to file appeals, and in 2006 the sentence was upheld. Not Two years later as a horror had a sort of mental collapse. He stopped all contact with his family and followers. He stopped eating and that's, he was spoonfed. He refused to use the toilets and instead took to wearing an adult diaper, soiling himself in silence in a gloomy corner of his cell, defeated and forgotten.

Speaker 1:          21:05          He stayed like that for the next decade. On July the sixth 2018 God's led as a horror from his cell. Now it's into the yards alongside six other armed cultists, so he hadn't seen for 12 years. It's impossible to know what the other cultists fell. Seeing him in that moment, seeing the man who'd ones bend to them and off of Tokyo, to his will, reduced to a silent living corpse. Do they feel remorse? Did they see him for the false gods that he always was? We'll never know. All seven were hangs that morning. Their families only alerted after they were already dead. They were cremated inside the prison. Their bodies burned is that once burned, those of their victims, when news of [inaudible] death reached the media and most living outside of Japan kind of just shrugged and we're like, who? Yes. Even now, his story, it might not be over in 2000 just as as a horror was falling into his catatonic state.

Speaker 1:          21:56          Oh, officially renounced him breaking into two offshoots. The majority renamed themselves and leaf. They set up a fund to compensate oms victims and swore to become peaceful, but they never complete these succeeded in exercising as a horror. Today there are around 1,500 eleaf members. Journalists reported that many who still live surrounded by us, a Horace teachings, reading his books and decorating their homes with portraits of him. Although under surveillance by Japanese authorities, they continue to worship the cultists to tried to destroy the wells and then also loan. In 2016 the tiny European nation of months and Negro expelled a 58 foreign is suspected of being members of home, although forward Japanese, the majority were Russians. That same year, Russian authorities busted 25 compounds operated by the group of prosecutors of warms that there may be up to 30,000 Russians currently involved with the cult. The BBC has since reports.

Speaker 1:          22:46          If the group operating and Bellaruse and Ukraine shockware Sahara, maybe debt, but his influence, it clearly remains. While there's no evidence, his remaining followers, a planning, more terrorist atrocities, they still worship the man who once brought Tokyo to its knees. For a man as charismatic as, as a horror, it seems his knocked legacy extends even beyond the grave. So I already have you found that video. Interesting. Hopefully we answered that big.
