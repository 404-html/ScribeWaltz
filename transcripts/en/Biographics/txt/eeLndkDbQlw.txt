Speaker 2:          00:28          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:29          now is likely you've already heard of coco Chanel either from her famous perfume or the luxury clothing brands based on our name as a woman trying to build a business in a time where the world was controlled by men. Chanel started at less than zero. Then you had, she found a way to climb to the position of being one of the most wealthy and powerful women in the world on today is biographics. We're here to tell you the true rags to riches story of Coco Chanel.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Gabrielle Chanel was born on August the 19th 1883 and Francis La Valley. Her mother, usually Sean Deval was an unwed laundry woman. She gave birth to Gabrielle in a charity hospital run by nuns on the day she was born. Her mother had to ride traveling where the father's name should be. That wasn't just an excuse for an absentee dad though because Albert's Chanel traveled from towns down selling clothes to local peasants. Gabrielle has one oldest sister, Julia, and they were less than a year apart. The couple had their hands full with two infant daughters and they could hardly scraped by with what little money they hat in 1884 Elvis and Joel's family gave them money so that they could pay for a marriage license. Off to that union was official. They had several more children and the family all lived in a cramped one room apartments in the town of Breve. Like our day, Gabrielle Learns Outer, so at an early age to help her father with his clothing business, but when she was just 12 years old, Gabrielle's mother came sick and died.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Raising young children is very much a full time job. He could not earn an income and take care of them at the same time. He sent his sons to work on a farm and the girls were sent to a convent to be raised by nuns. The nuns taught her discipline as well is how to read and write. She lands a carry herself with the grace and the elegance of a lady rather than a peasant. Most of the other children living in the convent, they were orphans, but since her father was still alive, Gabrielle refuse to consider herself an orphan too. She held onto the hope that her father would return one day and that they could be a family again. At this time in our life, books acted as a way for her to get lost. In a world of fantasy. She began to create elaborate stories about her own life as well to help ease the pain of her reality laser in life. One of the most common stories she told her friends was how she was raised by Hystrix aunties. She continued to tell lies and half truths about our past, which made it almost impossible for anyone to know. Just how difficult her childhood Trudy had been.

Speaker 1:          02:57          That's Age 18 Gabrielle, the convent to find a job. There are very few opportunities for women to find work, but she was lucky to have sewing skills that should have learned from our father. She won't as a seamstress during the day, making clothing for the rich ladies in the town of Milan. This was a very solitary job ans she was his in a backroom, working long hours, mending and assembling garments at night. She worked a second job as a nice club where she would sing and dance in front of a crowd. When she was 23 I actually caught the attention of a man named Etienne Belle's song. He was the ad, so the wealthy Bellstone gamant company, which supplied the French army with its uniforms. Gabrielle Chanel's started going by the nickname coco. Yes. Later, or even Chanel herself would tell a different story of where the name came from.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Somebody that was based on the lyrics of a song she used to sing. Others think it's short for the French Coco, which means a kept woman or in today's slang, a sugar baby. For someone in Gabrielle Chanel's situation. These wealthy men were the only hope she had of escaping poverty. Balsam had a type which was aspiring actresses, the girlfriends. He lived with him before Chanel was named Emily Oh, dialing codes. She went on to become rich and famous with a successful career in Paris. Gabrielle has no delusions about the relationship that she had with and [inaudible] and she knew that by sleeping with him he could introduce her to the right people. This officer, a few auditions, it was clear that she just wasn't cut out for Shay business. She was staying. It's Bell Saul's house in the country. The Chateau de Roy low for a few days don't was sets in the middle of the forest where but also enjoy riding horses and hunting.

Speaker 1:          04:28          When his guests came over the weekend, he kept like his dirty little secrets telling her it's 101 of the back bedrooms. This was infuriating for Chanel. It was clear that about someone was willing to sleep with her, but he was ashamed to be seen with our in public. Plenty of people would feel completely dejected by this whole situation, but instead of feeling defeated, this sparked a fire in her. She wanted to prove that she was worthy of being this party. The only problem was that the clothes, she arrived in majors and now they're on vias that she was Paul. So she took one of ball salts suits and cut it apart, tailoring it to fit her body perfectly. Then she showed up to the party on invited. She heard herself with confidence while everyone's heads turned to to see this beautiful woman standing in a mountain suit.

Speaker 1:          05:10          When the guests asked why she was dressed like that, she casually said that it was far more comfortable. Remember, this happened in the year 1906 so this was completely unheard of. Women wearing corsets, long gloves, and multiple layers of Scott's at this party. Chanel was clever and it's interesting to talk to you. When she made new friends, she would make up elaborate stories about her past, just like she had done as a young bill. She wants to add my life, didn't please me. So I created my life. Basile was impressed by this stuff, so he allows her to continue living at his chateau [inaudible]. She joined is in a secular friends. He began to treat her to new clothes and jewelry, but she continued to use the fabric from Belle songs, discarded clothing to make herself outfits to wear instead. For most women nodding, there's a fabric feathers and Jules was a way to show off that they were married to someone who had a lot of money, thought these things were rather vulgar and she doesn't care if a simple style may to look poor.

Speaker 1:          06:02          She just wanted to be comfortable. Soon enough, other women began to copy cocoa style. Looking at photos of Chanel and our youth, it's almost as if they were taken today or like if she was a time traveler sent back a hundred years. He has an idea. She was quoted as saying, in order to be irreplaceable, one must be different during World War One, when everywhere began to wet pants because they had to work while their husbands were away, but by the time the men married, they wanted their wives to go back to wearing dresses. Of course women in the Aba class never got to work a tool so they never stopped wearing their core sets and the layers of uncomfortable fabric. If Coco Chanel was going to convince them to change, it would happen in stages. And over a very long period of time

Speaker 1:          06:49          when she was 26 years old, Gabrielle mess, an English businessmen named off a capitalist, one of FTO and bell souls potties, everyone calls him by because he was the illegitimate son of an aristocrat. He worked his way up in the world to become a self made man out of everyone in Belle songs in a cycle. He was one of the only people who actually worked for a living. Chenelle was not satisfied to sit around and do nothing all day like other kept women. She was earning an income from selling custom made hats to women who had moto style. This, she got the money in cash at the time, women could not own businesses, rented apartment, so even have bank accounts without a guarantor, which was usually the father or the husbands. All the capital would see that Gabrielle Chanel was a genius and he believed in her long before anyone else did.

Speaker 1:          07:32          He encouraged us to open a shop and see helps out by putting his name on everything. Gabrielle ran the business entirely on her own and began hiring women's. You increased production. Boy and Coco were the perfect path because they were both passionate about each of that respective businesses and had a mutual respect for one another. All the capital used his experience to help look over contracts and negotiate the business deals, but the rest was all on her. Even before opening how fast sharp Chanel already has loyal can tell from Paris. It became successful right out of the gates and she began seeing profits almost immediately. Boyan Coco use the money. It's about just a lavish townhouse in Paris which doubled as a fashion studio. The whole of the ground floor was an open space filled with a workshop. She created jobs for women in the local area and just staff was growing all the time upstairs.

Speaker 1:          08:18          She kept in a Polman's and whenever capitol was in Paris, he lived with her there. Then. Then that's what she did to prove how success Coco Chanel could never be seen as the marrying type in the eyes of the aristocracy. As a member of a noble family off the capital was expected to end as a fan. Erin's marry someone with a title. In 1918 he had an English woman named Diana Windom who was a widow and related to and assortments of ELLs and Dukes, but he and Chanel, they was still very much in love and it's continued that relationship behind closed doors. On the 22nd of December, 1919 off the capital, died in a car crash on his way to spend the holidays with Coco. His was on Christmas Eve. They were together for nine years and Chanel plans you live out the rest of her life with him. She was just 35 years old when he died off the capital of being the love of her life and no other man ever came close to replacing him.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Years later, her name would be known around the world and those same hours to craft. So you refuse to accept a, we'd be fighting to where, how designs they came up, points in her life. When has celebrity catapulted her to a place where she could have married anyone. She wants it but she never did the one man she wants it to be a husband was gone forever. He knew her before, during and after a success and there was no way to replace that. But she had a resilience that helps her to keep going no matter what she said. When you're feeling sad, add bold lipstick and attack. Okay. Okay. So just before we get into the fashion and war and Nazis, let me take a moment to tell you about Squarespace who make videos like this.

And let's get back to Coco Chanel

Speaker 1:          11:06          off to the unexpected death of her beloved boy Coco Chanel need to define a new business partner. At that time, she had over 300 employees. She was designing couture dresses that were selling for over 3000 francs each. In today's money that's more like $38,000 per dress. She had an entire army of women making these things. You would think that this should have proven that she was more than capable of running a successful business best? Well, no, she was still a woman, so the banks refused to deal directly with hub. It would become impossible for her to run a business on cash alone and it was completely necessary for how to seek help from a new male partner. The law banning women from opening bank accounts. It would not change until 1965 after the passing of the French family law. This is when she met Pierre the Timia. He had a reputation for working together with other luxury brands around Paris and the offer to become her business partner.

Speaker 1:          11:55          The only issue was that Chanel knew nothing about nor or business contracts off the capital is always had a best interest at heart, and he gave us the freedom to run her business as she pleased and keep the profits for herself. So she was too trusting and she unwittingly signed a contract that said Pfs II ma was entitled to take 90% of our business profits. Even though this contract, it was ridiculously unfair, is meant that Chanel could stay in business and she did not let this setback. You've got the best of that. In 1921 Chanel began working with the celebrity puffy and chemist named Ernest burrow. At the time, women were wearing oils that had a single floral scent. She wants us to create a perfume with the layers which developed over time. This is when they created Chanel number five and it became one of the best selling perfumes in the weld for years to come.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Perfume and candle makers would copy the idea of mixing various sense together to create a unique experience. Before Chanel. Women never wore black unless they were in mourning in the 1920s vogue competitor, iconic little black dress to Ford's model t. It was simple elegance and revolutionary. Soon enough, people around the world what? Looking to Chanel for inspiration. It was a ripple effect and women's clothing in the rest of the wells without Coco Chanel. There's no telling what kinds of clothes women would be wearing. Today is data. It should now reflect it. On that time saying, I gave women a sense of freedom. I gave them back their bodies bodies that were drenched in sweat. She had a fashions finery, lace courses, underclothes padding, despite the fact that she swore off, have a marrying Chanel continued to be in relationships with men, but then that's how powerful they may have been.

Speaker 1:          13:27          She always stayed true to herself. If she dated Grand Duke, Dimitri Pavlovich, who was related to the Russian Remann Hall family. Next was Edward, the eighth Prince of Wales and before the dawn of world war two she began a relationship with a German man named Barron Hans Gunther von Dinklage. Looking at a track record, it would seem that she had a personal goal of trying to see if she could date at least one iris to crash from every country in Europe, but not decision to be in a relationship with Vaughn. Dinklage would become both a blessing and to cuss. Just a few years later, the Nancy bought, he would rise to power and Chanel's lover would reveal his true colors.

Speaker 1:          14:07          By the 1930s business was absolutely booming as they needed all the space they could guess and the house of Chanel, how role female stuff increased in numbers and it became necessary for Chanel to move out of the studio and into the Hotel Ritz, which was directly across the street from our business. Hey, 1936 there was a labor movement in France and workers were demanding better conditions across the country. On the 26th of April or Coco Chanel arrives at our studio to see that all of our employees were sitting on the floor and protest. They all refuse to work unless their wages were increased and their work hours were lessons. Chanel was outraged because she already paid these women higher wages and gave more vacation time than any of the business. Instead of giving into their demands, she fired every single one of them on the spot saying that they were in grateful and that she could do the walk on our own, but they refuse to move.

Speaker 1:          14:54          Finally, she gave in to their demands for the sake of getting on with the work. Now, in 1939 Germany had occupied Poland's and Chanel knew that it was only a matter of time before they were coming for France. It's possible. That's how boyfriends vom Dinklage lesson knew that the takeover was imminent. She paid off all 300 of our workers and encourage them to seek safety. Before it was too late. Coco Chanel, she was not going to need that business though the metal. What happens just three months later, Germany occupied France, the Nazis destroyed the businesses and the homes of countless numbers of French people. The Nazis even took over. The hotel. Ritz is the headquarters, so Chanelle very literally how to live among them. How Homans our business. We're both safe. So long as she continued that relationship with Vaughn Dinklage, but knowing Chanel, she would have hated this.

Speaker 1:          15:35          She never wanted to be beholden to any men. That's a learned, the ones who thought they could rule the world. The Nazis knew that she was close friends with the British royal family, so they asked if she would become one with that secret agents. In 1943 she was given the code name model hat on a trip with Vaughn Dinklage. She met with Winston Churchill and handed him a letter which gave Geminis demands for England's surrender. Obviously he didn't take the offer and it wouldn't be surprising if he crumpled up the paper where he stood. There is no way of knowing what was said between Churchill and Chanel, which she actually double agent divulging Nazi secrets. We will never know, but when the war was over, Chanel was never brought to trial for cooperating with the Nazis. She didn't have a spoke about that time and buried deep like she did with all of the other unpleasant memories and her life.

Speaker 1:          16:20          Coco Chanel ever said anything publicly. There was antisemetic. The Yoni documented issues she ever had was with Pierre [inaudible], who just so happens to be Jewish. Often the Nazis occupied France. They were seizing any property that belonged to the Jews, and that included businesses. She wrote in that to, to the Nazi government asking if there was a chance that she could buy back the remaining 90% of house Chanel. However, the family temporarily sold their business entities to Christians during the war, and that already fled to safety. They're all plenty of people who cannot forgive Coco Chanel for cooperating with the Nazis. But for a moment, just put yourself in her shoes. She had two choices. Break up with her boyfriends, condemn the Nazis and lose everything well bite tongue and keep on pretending for the benefits of maintaining the life that she had worked so hard to build. She chose a life and if she were alive today, she probably wouldn't even bother to explain how decisions in her own words. I don't care what you think of me and I think about you. I've told when the war was over in 1945 Chanel dumped from Dinklage quicker than you can say, Oh Fida Zane. She then moved on to having an effect with a Spanish artist, Salvador Dali, which is an interesting choice to say the least.

Speaker 3:          17:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:32          When the war was over in 1945 Coco Chanel was 62 years old and she no longer felt inspired to create new clothes. She chose to retire from the fashion world for years and lived off the royalties from the sales of her perfume. In 1958 she found her second wind at the age of 75 she unveiled new designs and reopens House Chanel. This sponsor resurgence in the brand's popularity, Coco Chanel trays, a man named Karl Lagerfeld's to be his successor for the brands. She had more than enough money to retire and live a comfortable life, but she worked until the day she died on January the 10th 1971 when she died, she was 87 years old and touch an estimated net worth of $100 million. Now, this might sound like a lots of money, but do keep in mind the Pfs, him, his grandsons still own 90% of Chanel even to this very day.

Speaker 1:          18:18          Then Alan, multibillion as today, many people think of Chanel as a brands that is intimidating and unattainable, but for those who look at the price tag, they missed the point Coco Chanel was quoted saying on more than one occasion that she believed people should wear. What makes them happy? What are the colors you feel great in and the style that makes you feel comfortable instead of trying to be flashy or to follow a trend, your attitude and the way you carry yourself speaks far more than the clothes on your back. She said, fashion is not something that exists in dresses. Only fashion is in the sky, in the street. Fashion has to do with ideas the way we live and what is happening.
