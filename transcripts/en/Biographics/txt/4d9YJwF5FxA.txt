Speaker 1:          00:00          Bolted. The Siberian Husky is remembered for leading a team of sled dogs to deliver medicine that saved the town of Nome, Alaska from a deadly epidemic. He became a national hero and this photo was on the front page of every newspaper in the country. The statue was erected in his honor in central park in 1925 and it is still one of the most beloved tourist attractions to this very day. Many of you might have seen the animated film by universal pictures and that might be all you know about Baltic, but the true story is far more dramatic than what you ever learned from cartoons and children's books. And in the video today, we're bringing you the story of Bulto, the canine hero.

Speaker 1:          00:48          A story begins in the remote town of Nome, Alaska in the 1890s the name gold rush brought prospectors to this small town in the hopes of making a rich. There were no paved roads, so it was incredibly difficult for people to get around, especially in the winter. Many of the people who move to know Matt to adjust to life in Alaska and they became a very tight knit community. These people, they had a lot of respect for one another because they were all managing to survive in the American wilderness if anyone was struggling. Neighbors helped one another out without hesitation and it really fostered a close knit community and our region man named Leon Hart's. Seppala owns a dog Kennel in Nome, so pilar is creditors that being the first man to introduce Russia's working dog breed from Siberia to the United States and they later got the name Siberian Husky.

Speaker 1:          01:33          These dogs became so popular in Alaska that he decided to breed them for a living. He was only interested in breeding dogs that were light and we're fast. He became one of the first men to participate in competitive dog sled racing in the United States. One of the many puppies that was born in Isabella's Kennel was named Bolty. He was born with Brown eyes and black with white socks on his two front legs, but also it was apparently too large and it was considered a scrub doc. Supposed to had him neutered right away because he was deemed to be at far too inferior to pass on his DNA. Balto was born between the years 1919 in 1923 but no one can be quite sure of the exact date. Isabella. Essentially it was breeding so many dogs that he didn't really keep track of every puppy that he declared or reject for all of the other dogs that did not suit his needs.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Apollo would rent them out to members of the community to use for building their dog sleds in the Windsor Dog sleds became the only option for traveling out of town, so trade gold for supplies. Since so many men traveled to know, looking for jobs in the mining industry, so parlor was able to make a fortune horrendous thing out as well as selling as docs parlors. Favorite Tasky was called Togo. He was considered to be a perfect husky specimen who was incredibly light and muscular. As the story goes, Togo was so fast that he could race a train and when so supposedly he had all of his time and energy and do training. This favorite dog offers a man named Gunnar Carson had moved from Norway to Nome, Alaska to take part in the gold rush. He paid the rents upon as dogs do transport supplies to many were working in the gold mines. There is no record of why cousin chose bolt to be his lead dog, but most people believe it was because he felt some kind of connection from the start. Most mushers juice a dog to lead that they know they can trust. He saw something special in Baltimore and the decision to take him home, it was one day you're going to save his life.

Speaker 1:          03:23          No one was having one of the coldest winters on record. Temperatures were reaching minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which is minus 45 degrees Celsius. Wins were 50 miles or around 80 kilometers per hour that were several terrible blizzards that may travel conditions impossible and most people had no choice but to isolate themselves in their homes and just stay by the fire place. In December of 1924 a record number of children were going to the only doctor in town, Curtis Welch. At first, Dr. Welch thought that these children simply had a sore throat and their parents, they tried to nurse them back to health over the holidays. A few weeks later, in January of 1925 two children unfortunately died. It was at this point, the Dr. Welch realized that this was actually a highly contagious disease called diptheria and did an infected most of the children in town. The native Inuit children were affected the worst because diptheria was a white man's to seize this illness was nicknamed the strangling angel because the inside of the throat begins to turn to leather and people can no longer breathe or swallow.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Children were far more susceptible to catching diptheria than adults, so parents were watching helplessly as their sons and daughters were slowly choking to death. Dr. Welch announced that all of the children who were infected, it needed to be placed in quarantine in order to prevent an epidemic. The cure for diptheria it existed, but no one was not equipped to treat such a massive outbreak. They needed a medicine called antitoxins serum. Since Dr. Welch and his four nurses with the only medical professionals in town, they were working around the clock to treat those children. The total population of Knome was just 10,000 people, and even after placing the infected under quarantine, it was already too late. More people that were getting sick every single day. Everyone was afraid that if the outbreak was not contained, all of the children may die and it may spread to the adults as well.

Speaker 1:          05:05          On January the 22nd 1925 Dr. Welch sent out dozens of telegrams to doctors around Alaska and even sent a message to Washington DC hoping for the help to get enough antitoxin. They were eager to help, but the issue was delivery. The winds were far too strong for a plane to travel through that, whether it's that was too much ice for a ship to reach the harbor city where medicine could be delivered with anchorage, but the train stopped in a town called Nanana, which was 674 miles away from Nome. The only choice was to take sled dogs across the snowy Iditarod trail, which was normally a 15 to 20 day journey. There were plenty of obstacles in the way that slowed down such a journey, mountains, steep crevasses, and as the frozen Yukon River, I'll ask us, territorial governor Scott and Boone approved the plan for the best mushers to participate in a relay to a guide that teams of sled dogs.

Speaker 1:          05:52          The plan was for 20 men and 150 dogs to wait at checkpoints where they would pass off the antitoxin to the next team, so they were able to transport the medicine as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The first men to pick up the antitoxin at the train station in Nunno was named at Wild Bill Shannon. He traveled for 24 hours straight and minus 60 degree weather to get to the first checkpoint and other of the mushers. Bill Mccarthy, you came prepared with this, our moccasins for his dog's feet so that they wouldn't have to walk on the ice with that bear paws. Land on Zapala volunteered stick, the most dangerous part of the journey since he had the most experience, but he was very concerned with going fast and ordering his dog to go as fast as he could, just like you would in a race. He saw a man called Henry Ivan off, stopped on the trail because he was struggling with disobedient dogs.

Speaker 1:          06:36          A parlor chose to ignore him and sped past, instead of offering help, Ivan offensive runoff to Sapelo housing, the serum, the serum, I have it here. Thankfully it's Apollo hurt him and it was able to turn this state around and pick up the medicine, but his need for speed, it very nearly blew the entire mission. Since Dr. Welch should send telegrams all over the country a few days earlier, stories of the epidemic we're being printed in newspapers in the lower 48 states. This story, it was gripping and it was tragic and it could have been right out of a novel. Unbeknownst to the 20 minute people all over the United States began to hope and pray that they would make it just days before this happens. Hardly anyone had even heard of Nome, Alaska Butts. Once they knew so many young lives were at stake, everyone was rooting for them.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Gunna Carson had taken the Iditarod trail together with Balto several times on their supply runs, so we volunteered to be one of the 20 men that helped retrieve the medicine. Unlike land how'd Cipolla and the other men, Carson did not compete in dog racing, but also was his pat when they weren't working together. Carson was very quiet and shy around other people, so [inaudible] was his best friends and he knew he could rely on him. Karsten was considered to be a novice compared to the rest of the crew. Therefore, he was given one of the easiest legs of the trail, but also in constant really did lead a team of underdogs in more ways than one, but no one could predict what was gonna happen next. Well, going to cost and was on his leg of the journey, a terrible storm again. Each one of the checkpoints stations received a message that the serum and run was temporarily canceled because it was too dangerous, but constant was already in the wilderness with all of the antitoxin.

Speaker 1:          08:13          When the visit hit, he obviously had no way of getting the memo. Also, there was nowhere for him to take shelter until the storm blew over. The blizzard caused a White House. Carson could not even see his hand in front of his face. That's alone, have a sense of direction. He stopped moving for two hours cuddling next to bolt the rest of his sled dogs. He was hoping that the storm would pass and they could carry on. However, he could not stop thinking about the children in the hospital with every passing minute and other child could die without the medicine and if he waited much longer, it was likely that they would not survive the night. He decided that his only option was to move forward despite not being able to see anything gonna cost and had to put all of his faith and his dog. Baltic dogs have a far better sense of direction than humans.

Speaker 1:          08:55          Balsa, who had been through the trail many times before the dog was leading the way, using a census to guide the rest of the team to why they needed to go. At one point they were hit by a wind tunnel. It was so strong that it knocked over the sled. The medicine went flying into a large snowbank. Carson could not find it for a very long time. He got down on his hands and knees and he started digging through the snow before he finally found the antitoxin. Also in the team, they finally reached a town called port safety, which was the next checkpoint and the relay. However, he arrived in the middle of the night and since the next musher had been told the relay was canceled, he and the dogs had fallen asleep with just 12 miles left to go. Carson decided to push through the last leg of the journey himself. When they arrived back in Nome, it was five 30 in the morning and he went straight to Dr. Welch once the vaccine thought he was able to administer it to the infected children and they will made a full recovery.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Soon after arriving back in Nome, journalists from all over the United States began to contact going to Carson and asked for an interview so that they could hear the story of his near death experience, bringing the antitoxin to the sick children. He was always humble and downplayed his involvement in securing the medicine. He says to the other drivers and dogs, the most creditors do. They're the heart and mush more difficulties for them. I know I can say yes for myself. We were glad to serve Americans all over the country. They wanted to meet ball too, and children love listening to the story of this real life. Dog Hero. Balto was invited to the Biltmore hotel in Los Angeles. Gunner Carsten agreed to the interview and he was shocked to see movie stars showing up to have their picture taken with the dog. Normally a national hero is welcome to Los Angeles with keys to the city, but Balsa was given the boons to the city and stat paramount pictures, hard hardball too, and going to Carson to star in a dramatized documentary gold bolters rest at noon.

Speaker 1:          10:38          It became a blockbuster hit in 1925 they made copies of the film, but there was a studio fire in the 1930s the destroyed them all. So sadly, this movie no longer exists. They traveled by train across the whole country and in December of 1925 they arrived in New York City. Balto was put on stage on Broadway for a week and a Vaudeville show. He also posed for a sculptor who created the bras statue that stands in central park. There was a ceremony that unveiled the bolt statue, which included a plaque that said dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that are relayed antitoxins 600 miles over rough ice across treacherous waters through Arctic blizzards from Nanana to the relief of the stricken gnome in the winter of 1925 endurance fidelity intelligence. Even though the statue was meant to commemorate all of the 150 dogs, it was clear that Balto was the only one in the limelight.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Then announced Apollo was still Balto is true owner, but going to Carson was getting all of the credit. So Paula, he was jealous of this because he had dedicated the majority of his life to breeding and racing dogs. He also took the most risk during the journey by volunteering for the most dangerous portion of the trail. By this logic, he thought that he would have gotten all of the glory and it was truly a low blow for the least skilled musher and dogs to get all of the attention. Not only that, but he also was angry that bolter who he considered a subpar dog was now representing the sub area and Husky breed. He believed that he and Togo deserve to be on the front page, not those damages any he to Nome, Alaska after a year long American tour going to cost and found that support a lot.

Speaker 1:          12:07          It wasn't the only one who was upset. The community was split between those who believe to Togo deserved the recognition and those who supported Balti. Some even accused costs of skipping the last stop on purpose because he would have known this. The sled to arrive in town with a medicine would have gotten all the glory, but many historians do not believe that Carson could possibly be motivated by famed. He would've had no way of knowing that the whole country was waiting to hear news about the small town in the middle of Alaska. He was simply too busy and just trying to stay alive for suppose polar. The statue of Baltar in central park, it was the last straw. He wanted to get rid of ball too and decided that he needed to go on his own door with Togo in an attempt to brand him as the true dog heroin.

Speaker 1:          12:45          He and his manager, they planned a huge spectacle of traveling to New York City to write his team of dogs down Broadway and end up at Madison Square Garden, but even on these tours, children, they were still asking about Balsa. No matter how hard he tries people, it's still loved the adorable black Husky with white socks, that that is musher through a visit. Since they announced Apollo was still a Bartos legal owner, he decided to get rid of him for good by putting bulto into the rest of the dog team up for auction. Go to Carson was mortified and he could not afford to bid on Balto to save him from his fate. When Baltar was sold, Carson lost his best friends. He was never the same again.

Speaker 1:          13:27          Balto when the rest of the dog so deem they were sold to a man named Sam Houston who put them on display. It is dime museum in Los Angeles. These were typically filled with oddities and freed shows. People paid a dime for a ticket to go around and stare at the live attractions. The dogs would change the wall all day every day. They were not allowed to run or to play, and Houston hardly fed them and they became sick with mange. In 1927 a man named George Kimball from Cleveland, Ohio was visiting Los Angeles and he bought a ticket to the Sam Houston dime museum. This is where he found bolted. Kimble read all the stories in the newspapers, so it was horrified to see these heroic dogs being mistreated. They asked Sam Houston what it would take to buy balls, him, and he was told that it would take $2,000 off to modern day inflation.

Speaker 1:          14:09          That's more like $28,000 George Campbell could not afford that himself. So when he returned to Cleveland's, he began a campaign to save Baltic. The story of the dog's heroic ms treatments. It ran in the local newspaper. Citizens of Cleveland donated whatever they could afford. Even young children brought their pennies to Campbell's campaign hoping to save their heroin. 10 days later, they had raised enough money to buy Balto and they had a little extra leftover to save his friends as well. When the dog's arrived in Cleveland's, they were finally allowed to pull a sled again as a team and a crowd of 15,000 people lining the street, sharing and giving the dogs a standing ovation and the city. It didn't stop that citizens of Cleveland's. They put together the money to build. The dog is a large enclosure at the zoo with a grassy field for them to run and play.

Speaker 1:          14:50          The city considered them to be their paps. They were given more love and attention than most docs have. A get ballsy remained at the Cleveland Zoo for the next six years. When he was between 11 and 14 years old, he became very sick and he could barely walk. When children heard that he was missing from the grass enclosure, they would call the zoo every day asking for updates to see if bolt I was feeling better. But the veterinarians, they knew that it was more humane to put them to sleep. When Balsa, who died the entire country Mont it's death, it was once again on the front page of every paper. People loved him so much they didn't want to let him go. So bold, whose body it was turned into a taxidermy figure is remains when we've to the Cleveland Museum of natural history. Ever since then, children go on school trips to see Balto and hear the story of the race to save Noman for all his efforts to raise [inaudible] from history.

Speaker 1:          15:37          So Paula failed to insert himself in Togo into the limelight to the extents that Balto had been that so go farther dozens of puppies. And when he grew older, he had a very comfortable doggy retirement living with a family friend in Poland, spring, Maine. When he died, his body was also stuffed and mounted at the Peabody museum of natural history at Yale University. However, it was never preserved properly and children were touching and petting Togo so much that the taxi, damn, you'd figure that came damaged. He eventually had to be removed from the museum even after the dogs had passed away. There was still plenty of people in this lending community who believed that Togo truly deserved the fame over [inaudible]. But what we do know for sure is that if it were not for Gunnar Carson's complete trust and is brave dog, the entire team would have frozen to death in that blizzard.

Speaker 1:          16:22          The vaccine for Knome would have been buried under piles of snow and there is no telling how many people would have died as a result. But what we do know is that ball to the dog was a hero. I'm certainly a very good boy back in Alaska, going to cost and live to quiet life. Years later, his niece, Janice Wayland's, asked her uncle to tell her the story of what really happens with bolty since she had had so many different versions of the story from children at school. He replied, I will tell you this once and only once if it wasn't football, so I wouldn't be alive today. And so I already have you found that video interesting and inspiring.
