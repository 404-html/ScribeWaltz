Speaker 2:          00:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17          During the 13th century and merchants named Marco Polo returns home to Italy after spending 24 years living in the Mongolian empire, he had the bad luck of getting arrested in Genoa while they were at war with his hometown of Venice. He was a prisoner for two years and he just happened to share his cell with a famous writer named [inaudible] Piza. The two of them shared stories with one another. As you do when you're stuck in a prison cell with absolutely no form of entertainment. Rista Jello was so captivated by the stories of Markopolos Jannie this he knew that it would make a great book. So they spent those two years in captivity writing the manuscript together. When they were released from prison, they published the travels of Marco Polo Mens. It became an overnight best seller. Marco Polo became the first Europeans in documents. So many details about the Mongolian and Chinese empires.

Speaker 1:          01:07          The Western world had a difficult time believing that it was possible that there could be a civilization now there that was actually more advanced than theirs is stories. They were so fantastic that people assumed that it was a work of fiction for the rest of his life. Marco Polo, he was called a liar. It would take hundreds of years before the world would know that every single story he told was absolutely true and yes, even today, there are some skeptics who find it hard to believe that one man could have seen and done so much in his lifetime, but he has still gone down in history as being one of the greatest explorers in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Marco Polo was born into a wealthy Venetian family in the year 1254 it was expected to follow the family trade of becoming a merchant's. His father, Niccolo and his uncle mafia were traveling most of Marco's young life. I like a normal job. Merchants were expected to leave home for years at a time. They traveled the world as they gathered popular items like spices, pals and goals and gemstones that were plentiful in certain countries. They then sold these goods in other countries where they were more valuable. They would earn enough money to last for years and then again set out on a new journey, but that's how I'm travelers would return to Europe claiming that they had seen amazing creatures in the Far East. Many of these, they weren't complete works of fiction. There were stories about a country full of human dog hybrids, fire breathing dragons, and mystical unicorns.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Christians believes that the garden of Eden was somewhere the hemorrhaging in the Middle East and Jerusalem was located in the exact center of the world. A lot of people either fully believed these fairy tales or trays to take everything with a grain of salt. There any people who knew the truth about what when's on in foreign countries were the ones who had seen these places with their own eyes at a time when traveling man going on a journey that requires ceiling walking or horseback riding. People could only go so far before they ran out of money, food, and water. So the only people who really traveled the world with the merchants, they had generations of the family's maps and personal experiences behind them. It took an entire lifetime to write half of the journey. Marco Polo grew up learning to read, write, and speak multiple languages while his father and uncle were gone.

Speaker 1:          03:21          His mother passed away and he spends a lot of his time at home, eagerly waiting for his father and uncles to return so that they could go on an adventure together. By the time Nickelodeon's, Matthew finally resigned to Venice. Marco Polo was 15 years old. They told the boy that they had spent several years in Constantinople before finding themselves ushered into China. At the heart of the Mongolian empire, the leader could Bly. Khan was interested in meeting them because they'd never seen European men before. The con was impressed by their ability to read and write in so many languages and he believed that they could be very useful to him. The Polo brothers were treated as esteemed guests and they were given luxuries beyond their wildest dreams. He asked them to resend to Italy on a mission to meet with the pope, could blown colon had requested for the Podo brothers to bring back 100 priests.

Speaker 1:          04:06          The Mongolian Empire. Kublai Khan was a Buddhist, but he was very accepting of all cultures and religions. He wants to Christians to come into his empire to help diversify academic knowledge of the kingdom. Unfortunately for the Polos, they returned to find that the Vatican was arguing over who would become the next pope. Niccolo Ans Mofo brought back golden gemstones there were hidden in the lining of their clothes and they were able to sell them for a small fortune for two years. They prepare tax returns, Mongolia and taught Marco all about what to expect on the journey. Without the help of the pipe, they could only convince to priests to come with them. When Marco was 17 his father and uncle packed up the caravan and so they set off on a journey across the lands that would take them a full three years.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Traveling from Italy to China was no small task. The polos had plans to take a boat there, but they realize this after years of being away, the families share but fallen into disrepair and that would be no way for them to sail. They had no choice but to go on foot. If they went straight through the desert, they would never make it so they had to go on a journey. Where they were able to stop at small cities and OAC is along the way. They would have taken camels, horses and donkeys to help carry the supplies. They aged dried meat and drank water and once they reached a town or city, they would barter with their goods to trade for fresh fruits and vegetables in the marketplaces. All along the way, they carried goods that they could sell for a profit in the next country.

Speaker 1:          05:33          The journey would have been exhausting and they would have been exposed to brutal elements, but there were also countless numbers of bandits waiting to steal from traveling caravans. Marco Polo matches the Tata who are known to kill men without mercy, but the Polo family was gifted with golden passports which provided them protection from the great con. It was written this, if anyone were to mess with the Polos, they would have to face the wrath of comms and tire. Army because of this he never mentioned is going through many hardships during that journey except for the fact that the two priests, somebody couldn't handle it. They were forced to turn back and returned to a city department is not to cross over the permia mountains in South Central Asia. He describes the basic colds and tell that funds were never as hard as they were back home. The next big challenge was the Gobi desert where they periodically came across the scatter dozens of dead animals and humans who had not survive the harsh conditions.

Speaker 1:          06:26          He often heard the singing sand dunes. He described as just sounding like different instruments playing all at once and sometimes it sounded like the dunes where we're spring, his name, it was enough to drive a mad Matt. There was stories of men wandering into the desert to try and find the source of the music, but they never returns. Now this story, Trudy does sound supernatural because it was as if some vengeful spirit was trying to love men into the deserts, but this is actually a very real phenomenon. These musical notes come from the sounds of vibrations of sen sliding down the dunes that play the musical notes, g e orF , which some people have described as sounding similar to a cello. Once market Podo reached China, he became very ill and was afraid that he might actually die, but he founds mountains that were said to have magical healing powers and he climbs the mountain, breathe in the fresh and ruins founds.

Speaker 1:          07:15          Trudy did heal him. He read that into batch. Parents wanted their daughters to have sex with as many men as possible before they got married so that they could prove how desirable they would be as wives as he was a young European men. These patterns where practically throwing their daughters at mt have a foreigner review. That daughter's sexual abilities he mentioned is that Tibet was a great place to be for a boy who was 70 to 20 years olds. Of course, this story goes to a bit of controversy and it was one of the many examples of the stories that people found is too far fetched to believe bus. It is actually based on a real custom. Now, just before we get into the second topic, today's video, let me tell you a bit about Vince. Sarah watches, I'm wearing one of these watches right now.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Years Before Marco Polo was born, a powerful leader named to Gingiss con United, the Mongolian Empire. Once all of the Mongol tribes were led by a single leader, they began to conquer surrounding territories in Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Mongolian worriers what trains since they were toddlers to ride on horseback. As the men's spends their entire lives preparing her vassal, they simply had the strongest army in the world with millions of soldiers prepared to fight for the con. In each new generation, the strongest dad was chosen to be the new con Malkai Podo and his family. They were keen to see Kublai Khan, who was arguably one of the greatest rulers the empire had ever seen off to traveling or the 10,000 miles. Marco Knicker, Loewen's mafia, polo all arrived Kublai Khan, some a palace. They were all greeted as esteemed royal guests. Even though he had heard so many stories from his father and uncle, it could never compare to experiencing the real thing.

Speaker 1:          10:17          Marco Polo was completely blown away by the wealth and magnificence of the Mongolian empire. The palace was massive and it had its own park with lush gardens and exotic species of animals living on the lands. Even in the 12 hundreds the Chinese had advanced systems of heating and cooling. This had never seen in Europe pipes in the ground. He took the polished hardwood floors, which captured the royal court warm and the winds are engineers have constructed impressive buildings and bridges. Further vet sanitation systems were also years ahead of Europe. Everyone was clean, they smell good, and they dressed in luxurious silk robes shimmering with golden threats. For Marco Polo, it was like he has simply died and gone to happen. The colon through a celebration for the Polo family's arrival, and then they had a huge feast. They fetch over 40,000 guests and Marco Polo could fill this cup with unlimited drinks from a massive silver wine fountain.

Speaker 1:          11:08          He was incredibly impressed with Kublai Khan polo look time to him with an almost godlike reverends because it was an example of the perfect ruler. The grade column has incredible skill and battle like his ancestors before him, but he was also educated and level headed when it came to making diplomatic decisions. Instead of attempting to rule every single country that he conquered, Kublai Khan allowed existing government structures to continue functioning on their own, so long as they agreed to bow down to the con and pledged their allegiance to the Mongolian empire. This means that every territory was allowed to keep their religions, their languages, and their culture. Kublai Khan, he's celebrated diversity, and he believes that one day the Mongolian empire would spread across the entire planet. Because of this, it was very important to have advisors like Podo family and his courts to help him negotiate with foreign nations.

Speaker 1:          11:57          Marco Polo became one of Kubler icons, trusted advisors, and he was able to live among the royal court since he could speak five languages. He was very useful in diplomacy and negotiations. He was eventually trusted to be in charge of the Mongolian salt straightens broker deals for sending the minerals to other lands at that time. Salts. It was incredibly valuable even though it was relatively easy to produce. He described in great detail about how the workers made sold from boiling sea water in giant Vats, which is a technique that is still used in China today. Along with all of these responsibilities, Marco Polo was announced to enjoy all of the best entertainment that the empire to offer. There were musical performances, horse races, this Aaron's wrestling matches. Men of high standing were allowed to have their own harm as well. The most beautiful women in the empire were all brought to the palace.

Speaker 1:          12:44          He wrote about how for women were skilled and playing musical instruments and how they were all graceful and polite. Keep in minds that he was just 20 years old when he arrived and he had already had so much experience being the most popular guy in Tibet during his journey to China. While it's not included in his book, there is one Chinese court record from that time that is believed to be about Marco Polo. A foreign man was arrested because he was walking with a woman alone at night without an escort. This was illegal, but the young man was totally unaware of the Lawrence. He had diplomatic immunity, so they simply let him go, but not all of the wind in the Mongolian empire where there for the men's entertainments, Marco Polo witnessed Kublai Khan's knees. Princess could a union battle for her right to choose their own husbands. She set out to challenge that if any man could defeat her in wrestling, they would win a hand in marriage. However, no one was ever able to defeat her. Ng acquired a massive fleet of 10,000 horses. She was allowed to remain unmarried and fought alongside a father and battle even without polos helped keep her memory alive. Could a human story was so incredible that it has been passed down by word of mouth in China for hundreds of years.

Speaker 1:          13:55          It's Colin's believed that the polos would have been afraid of what would have happened to them after [inaudible] Khan's death. Since they were foreigners, not official citizens of the empire, they may not have had the same rights and privileges. Once he passed away. They claimed that they were homesick and humbly requested to return to Italy. The condo, you found them very useful and at first he didn't want to see them go, but eventually he relented saying that they could leave as long as they escorted a woman named Princess Kaka Chins and meet her new husband in Persia. She was also called the blue princess and she was remembered for her legendary beauty this time. They did not have to go through the harsh mountains and desert. They were able to take and boat departure, but over 100 people, they died on the journey. Only 18 survived, including the polos and the princess.

Speaker 1:          14:38          By the time he returned to Wesley. Marco Polo had been gone for 24 years and he was a bachelor in his forties during the war between Genoa and Venice, Marco Polo was arrested and the government illegally seized the majority of his wealth that he had acquired in his time away. He was able to hide some of his golden gem stones, but he was Trudy lucky that his book was a best seller, otherwise he may have ended up broke after all of those years away. As we mentioned before, mocket, they told these stories to wrist of cello and yes, he never describes himself very much of his personal life. Throughout the entire book, Maka Paleo is acting more like a journalist or a non biased observer. He pauses no personal judgements, and d simply explains the things that he was seeing. In a very matter of fact, way off to publishing the travels of Marco Polo, the author got mixed reviews.

Speaker 1:          15:23          Some people congratulated him for his accomplishments while others accused him of being a liar. Many of the stories challenged Christian beliefs about the outside wells and by comparison, the Mongolian Empire seemed superior to Europe and the number of ways they were wealthy. They were powerful, well educated, open minded, and said the strongest army in the world. These stories made some Europeans feel inadequate by comparison and they clung onto that ethnocentric worldview. In modern times, scholars have poured over the original manuscript of Margaret Polos books and comparative to details of ancient Chinese documents. They were able to confirm nearly every detail be incorrect, which proves that he was telling the truth or the long for the rest of his life market. Pilate tried to ignore the haters and he went on living his life. He got married to a Phoenician noble women and they had three daughters together and the records of his oldest daughter's dowry.

Speaker 1:          16:14          It was documented that he passed on the golden passport that he received from the con [inaudible] 24 Marco Polo was on his deathbed surrounded by his family. A priest showed up to meet him, his last rites and the urge to Polo to confess if he had Trudy lied about his stories as a way of convincing his soul, his dying words, whether it's the only told a fraction of all the stories about his amazing experiences, and if he had given away all of the stories in the book, it would blow everyone's minds and no one would have believed to many way as the years went on, there would be several new additions of market ponos books. Priests rewrote his stories with a Christian slant so that they could bolster Europe superiority. They highlighted session stories like the women in Tibet as examples of the sinfulness and depravity. They still could not stand the idea that China was just somehow better than Europe.

Speaker 1:          17:00          Unfortunately, the future generations would see this altered manuscripts and take it as a sign that white people needed to reform it. Foreign natives with Christianity, future explorers like Christopher Columbus used the salted Veshon of mocket paradise book as a guide for his own journey. However, the often got it wrong, believing that they had landed in an entirely different country without the ability to speak the language. Columbus assumes that he had landed in India and immediately set out to enslave the native people. They called an eye as the Lens for conquest and greed rather than attempting to assimilate or understands the native American language and culture. Now people love the story of Marco Polo, but no one truly knows what he looks like there. Are there any artists interpretations of how they imagined him even though he had so many stories to tell? We knew very little about the actual man.

Speaker 1:          17:45          We don't even really know what he did on a day to day basis, so anything about his, despite the fact that we know so little about who he truly was, he is still considered to be one of the most admired people in history, not just for his discoveries, but because he lived his life to the fullest extent. He was able to experience seeing a new world that was unlike anything that Europe had ever seen before, and he became the real life hero of every story about that one special person who is invited to a magical wells. And that in a way is what dreams are made of. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did, please do give us a thumbs up below and don't forget to subscribe.
