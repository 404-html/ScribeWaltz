Speaker 1:          00:00          Bill cosby as a standup comedian and accent, they became an American icon and someone who millions of people look to as a father figure and as a moral compass, he would disappoint the entire world. When they began to learn this, he was not at all the wonderful person that he portrayed himself to be detailed biographics we're going to talk about the life, the Korea and the downfall. Bill Cosby.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35          What do you make calls to be? Junior was born in Philadelphia in 1937 and he was one of four children. His mother and a Pearl was a maid and his father, William Henry Cosby senior was that steward in the u s navy. He was always the class clown and never took his education very seriously. He had failed so many classes that he decided to drop out of high school in the 10th grade in order to follow in his father's footsteps and join the navy. He eventually earned a GED through a military program. He went to Temple University in Philadelphia, runs, uh, an athletic scholarship to be on that track and field team while in college. She works part time as a bartender and would enjoy entertaining as customers by telling jokes and making witty comments. His customers encouraged him to get into stand up comedy so we began going to east coast comedy clubs in Philadelphia, in New York City.

Speaker 1:          01:22          People enjoy it as comedy is so much that he was able to book tours to the major cities around the country. He dropped out of college when he was 20 years old in favor of trying to make a career and stands up. He appeared in several TV series telling us jokes and including the tonight show in 1964 he married a woman named Camille Hanks. She was only 20 years old and in her sophomore year of college at the time and bill calls and he was 27 they met on a blind date and didn't know each other that well before they got married. They went on to have five children together during his stand up routines cause it'd be, would talk a lot about his kids and how difficult it was being a father. Most parents could relate to everything he was saying and it was considered to be clean, wholesome comedy.

Speaker 1:          02:01          In 1965 bill Cosby it at a starring role on the TV show I spike. He became the first African American to star in a network television show. He was an inspiration to people everywhere in the young black men particularly looked up to him as a role model. However, Isi was seen almost as a one hit wonder and Cosby was not given any more of these dashing roles in the future since he was so popular with parents and he had experience raising kids of his own, he turns one of his standup characters. Fat Albert's into a cartoon series geared towards young urban kids, often making some money from his career. He wins on to finish his bachelor's and eventually receive a master's degree and a phd in education from the University of Massachusetts. In the 1970s he used fat Albert's as his thesis statements, explaining all the ways you use the cartoon to educate children.

Speaker 1:          02:47          He goes to all of this on his resume for creating educational content for TV, which helped him land to gigs on future shows like picture pages, the electric company, and more deep down. Bill calls me it not want to continue making children's contents and he was really only doing it for the paycheck. He took a break from TV to come out with comedy albums and they did extremely well. He wants six grammy awards and he was suddenly thrust into the limelight as being one of the best standup comedians. He would pride himself in writing clean comedy that anyone could listen to and he would often criticize other black comedians like Eddie Murphy for using obscenities

Speaker 1:          03:29          when he was 47 years old. Bill Cosby start as a character named Dr Cliff Huxtable in the Cosby Shire. The Huxtables had five kids just like bill Cosby and Israel wife Camille. People assumed that this story was parallel to who he was in real life. It became so popular. The TV ratings showed that half of the country was tuning in to watch. At that time back, people were almost exclusively portrayed negativity in the media America witness criminal activity and controversial protests from the black community. This was the first show to portray and the upper middle class black family, both parents, they were funny intelligence and hardworking people who had an education. A black American was finally being seen in a positive light and it was so genuinely funny. Even white people were watching. It helps to bring society together and help them understands that really we're all the same. Unbeknownst to the audience, none of this was ever bill calls.

Speaker 1:          04:20          These idea the show was created by two television producers named Marcy Casi and Tom Water. They wanted to come up with a concept for a sitcom that no one had ever done before and often seeing bill Cosby stands up. They approached him about doing a series. Bill Cosby insisted that he would not work for less than a million dollars a year and the show needed to have his name in the title. He wanted to make this TV show all about him, even though the producers already knew what they wanted to do with the series. Bill Cosby tried to control the narrative. He pitched the idea that the show should be about a taxi driver who was tasked with taking care of the kids. He wants it to be married to a Latino woman and he feels he would be funny if she worked a traditionally male role like a carpenter or a plumber.

Speaker 1:          05:02          He chose a taxi driver for his character because he wants it to be able to go on monologues for the majority of episodes in order to tell the jokes that he normally tells in his stand up routines. The produces pushed it back with Cosby explaining that original vision for portraying the new black American family. They eventually convinced him to give it, to try and it exploded into a cultural phenomena. However, Bill Cosby received all of the praise and recognition for all of the positive changes that it made in society. The show was filmed in New York City and it attracted a lot of emerging African American talent. People love to build calls these character of cliff Huxtable, and most people believe that he was just playing an exaggerated version of himself. He was giving black people acting jobs when they had never had the opportunity to work in the industry before.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Is anything more than a background character or an extra, he would have a parade of women who had come to audition to be on the Cosby show. People who worked with him knew that he was constantly cheating on his wife. They assumed that these relationships were consensual. Ego would be seen speaking to Cosby. She would get one or two lines on the show and then she was never seen again, but no one could have imagined how dark the situation with bill Cosby actually was and the doors were closed and a lot of ways the Cosby show, Trudy did revolutionize the industry and no matter who he wants as a person, there is no denying that. He was also the first African American to win an Emmy, but for fans of the show, he was America's Dat. People idolized him and he knew it. He wasn't afraid to take advantage of people's trust and their respect to the absolute fullest extent, even though the vast majority of the show was fiction.

Speaker 1:          06:36          There were moments when bill Cosby incorporated stories from his real life into the Cosby show. For example, there was his relationship with his son, Ennis, who was the parallel to the character of Theo. He grew up getting bad grades in school and bill Cosby constantly called a son Lazy and told him that he wasn't trying hard enough. It was like to reveal the Ennis actually had dyslexia. Once he was given a tutor to help him cope with his disability, he began to do much better in school and went on to attend Columbia University teacher's college hoping to become a special education teacher. Bill Cosby told the writers of the show what it happens. They used a parallel storyline with the character of Theo, the characters playing Cosby's children. They all grew up and the show ended in 1992 in 1997 and this was on vacation in Los Angeles, driving a Mercedes. His car. He got a flat tire so he pulled over to the side of the road in order to fix it in a completely free active violence. A young white man who was high on drugs attempted to rob [inaudible] and it's reached for his wallet, but the man shot him in the head. When the Pavarotti, you showed off her bill Cosby's house asking for a comment about the death of his, I mean the son, he quietly said he was my hero and shut the door

Speaker 1:          07:49          often taking some time off to grieve. Bill Cosby returned to show business. He tried and failed to stop more TV series as well. He came back in the public eye after his famous Jello commercials. He was having financial trouble in the shows were no longer doing well in the ratings behind the scenes of the Jello commercial c scolded parents and kicks children off the set. If they were not behaving well enough, he would get into arguments with business executives about how to sell the product because he thought he knew better than them. He would often add lib instead of following the actual lines that had been given. This body being so difficult to work with, he was ending $3 million a year doing just these ads. Bill Cosby realized that the image of a perfect father, it was working and people loved it, so he decided that he wanted the world to believe that he truly was this great person.

Speaker 1:          08:34          He gave college scholarships to African American students and participated in multiple charities and his name. However they, his true colors would come out on set and whenever we went on lecture tours, he spoke down to African Americans under the guise of giving people tough love. If his words were spoken by a white person, they would be considered disgustingly racist. He was always very degrading talking down to other black people as if he was on this pedestal of some sort of moral high ground. One of the most famous examples of this is known as the poundcake speech. During this speech given at the NAA CP on the 50th anniversary of Brown and board of education bellicose. We blamed the black parents for their children's poor behavior and he wants something 20 minute rants and lecturing and talking down to African Americans who were living in poverty. He said that if it were not for their laziness and irresponsibility, then wise people would have more respect for African Americans.

Speaker 1:          09:26          He said, we are not Africans. Those people are not Africans. They didn't know a damned thing about Africa with names. Nick Shinika, Shelia Guar Muhammad's and all that crap and all of them are in jail. It was so bad that in the transcripts, the NACP how to add their own commentary in parenthesis off to some of Cosby's worst comments just so that people would know that they disagree with a lot of what he said. Some people agreed with bill Cosby. Ben's applauded him of the schools in a race traitor. In 2005 a sociologist and professor from the University of Pennsylvania named Michael Eric Dyson wrote an entire book in response called, is bill Cosby right? Or has the black middle class lost its mind. Dyson breaks down points, budding points, just how wrong bill Cosby is and how truly difficult it is. African Americans do overcome racial bus, white privileged and socioeconomic disadvantages.

Speaker 1:          10:25          It was never a secret that bill Cosby was cheating on his wife. He was often gold, a womanizer and openly admitted in multiple lens of years that he had girlfriends outside of his marriage once in Ebony magazine. He said, when you turn 40 you look at the enjoyment you may get from a given activity and then you look at the amount of work that may have to go into it. For example, sex with a young, beautiful women who has plenty of energy. A talented young actress named Lily Bernard was mentoring under bill Cosby and the hopes that she could get to pot on the show. She was zoned that he was taking the time to teach her about acting. He always told her that she was one of his kids and she truly did see him as a fellow, that she never has any intentions of sleeping with him and believed that everything was strictly professional.

Speaker 1:          11:08          She became friends with the other actors on set and everyone believed that she would eventually become a new character on the show. When Cosby thought she was ready, she finally got the part in the TV show, which was a speaking role that's only lasted for a few seconds, often knowing her for a year, Bill Cosby convinced her to go to Atlantic city with the promise that she would meet an agent who was going to help with her acting career. She had no reason not to trust him after all, she felt like bill Cosby was a dat when the golf that he gave her a drink and she blacked out. She woke up to him raping her on the floor. It was so surreal. She couldn't believe it was happening. She was in denial hoping that it was just a bad dream. My name was, I have Rhianna's. He see Sanken.

Speaker 1:          11:47          She told him that she would go to the police. He threatened to sue half a defamation and told her that she would go to, he also threatened to completely ruin her acting career. He's holds, Huh? You're dead to me. Bernard. You hemi. Your debt. Lydia Bernard's was no longer allowed on the side of the Cosby show. Not only did she lose a mentor and father figure, but she also lost all of her friends that she got to see every day. The events was beyond traumatizing far. She attempted to get a role in a few other TV shows, but eventually gave up on acting and decided to become an artist even years after the rape Lily Bernard's was afraid to come forward because she truly did believe that he would make good on the promise to sue her for defamation. She was a struggling actress in New York.

Speaker 1:          12:28          You could not pay our rents and let her learn, hire a lawyer. She also knew that if the idea of bill Cosby meant so much to her, it would also crush the hopes and dreams of African Americans across the country. She also knew that no one would believe her. Now is important. We added this was just one of many stories and we couldn't possibly go over all of them in the short video and social of 60 women came forward with similar stories about bill Cosby. Andrea comes down to is the first woman to come forward and publicly accused him of rape. They offered to pay for her college degree, but she brought him to court instead. Several journalists wrote about the case, but many people brushed it off as a false accusation. People said that comes down to is just trying to make money from bill Cosby him that he couldn't possibly be anything but this perfect cliff Huxtable guide that the kids over up with displaying to all of the proof being out that the issue was not reignited.

Speaker 1:          13:17          Again until 2014 a standup comedian named Hannibal Buress was gaining a lot of attention for his role in the comedy central series, broad city. During one of his standup shows, he called out. Bill calls me saying that he had no right to lecture black people on their bad behavior when he himself is a rapist. The story went viral. Suddenly people knew and they actually listened because it was another black man confirming the truth. Soon to she went public. 13 women approached Andrea constant to say that they'd also been victims of rape by bill Cosby. Soon after the comments by Hannibal Buress when viral, a reporter from the Associated Press attempted to ask him about the accusations. During this interview, we can see firsthand towel. Bill Cosby uses intimidation to make the reporter back down from revealing his comments on the rape accusations. He tells the reporter that if he wants to have a serious Korea, he will not show the questions. In that film. He was seen as so powerful that he was untouchable.

Speaker 1:          14:18          The spice. All of these accusations coming forward in the media. People truly could not fathom that bill Cosby was a rapist. Many of his friends, they came forward to defend them, including Whoopi Goldberg. She later recanted her statement. The first trial had a hung jury. They could not decide if he was guilty or nos. Prowls a supposed to be unbiased and jurors and not supposed to learn too much about a defendant outside of the court room, but decades of seen cliff Huxtable on the Cosby show on TV men's. It was nearly impossible for people to separate the tune of matter. How hard they try it. They just couldn't believe that this sweet man capable of such a horrible thing. Bill Cosby admitted more than once that yes, he gave quite alludes to women in order to have sex with them, but he didn't define that as rape.

Speaker 1:          15:00          He had actually admitted this in interviews with magazines. He is before all this, I don't have to hearing him say this so casually on the witness stand. The jurors knew that he was truly guilty. Even though 60 women have come forward, only three brought their claims to court. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean the rest of the line. It just means that they want to move on with their lives and not have to retell the stories of the worst moments in their life and have that personal and family lives exposed in the media. In September of 2018 he was convicted of aggravated indecent assault and was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. At 81 years olds. It's very likely that he will spend the rest of his life behind bars, so I already have you found that video. Interesting. If you did, please do give us a thumbs up below. Don't forget to subscribe.
