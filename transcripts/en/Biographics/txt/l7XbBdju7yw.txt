Speaker 1:          00:00          27 people. They were boys with their cars. Summer jobs. Oh my God. Are you one of them? He dressed up like a clown for them with his face painted white and red and on his best behavior in a dark room on the bed, he'd kill them all with the slight of his hand running far running fast to the debt.

Speaker 1:          00:23          Those are the lyrics from a song title John Wayne Gacy Jr by Sufian Stevens. It is just one of the countless pieces of art that have been inspired by this terrifying serial killer, John Wayne Gacy. It was a businessman and a politician to everyone around him. He was a sweet and charming that no one in his life could have a guest that he dressed up like pogo the clown and murdered teenage boys after dark. The Chicago Police Department found 27 bodies buried in his basement. They knew that his kill count though it was at least 33 and there could be more victims that were simply never found. This story became front page news and immediately captivated the nation. The fact that there's a killer clown truly existed in the world, struck fear into the hearts of people everywhere, believing that they could no longer trust circus performers around their children. The story of John Wayne Gacy has inspired writers to create their own versions of killer clowns, including pennywise from Stephen King as well as twisty the clown in American horror story. And in the upcoming 2019 DC comics film joker, Joaquin Phoenix portrays the character by copying pogo the clown's menacing makeup. So who was the man behind the face paints? How did he get this way and why did he go on such a murderous rampage?

Speaker 2:          01:34          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:39          John Wayne Gacy Jr was born in Chicago on March the 17th 1942 his father, John Stanley Gacy was a factory worker. John's father was very much a man's man who enjoyed sports and drinking bear. He really wanted a son and he imagined having a boy to do all over the traditional father on activities together with his mother and was a housewife. He was very sweet and loving to our children, John and and named their baby John Jr and gave him the middle name Wayne so that he could be named after the manly cowboy actor. John Wayne. Growing up with the family calls him. Johnny John Senior was a very strict disciplinarian and are raging alcoholic because of his outbursts. It's Johnny spent more time with his mother and sisters, John Senior. I've tried to play sports with him in the backyards and go on weekend fishing trips, but the boy was never really very interested.

Speaker 1:          02:24          He preferred to plant flowers, cook and do traditionally feminine activities. His father was extremely disappointed in Jonny, so he constant Nicodemus Sissy. He asked him if he was trying to be a girl and forbidden from doing the hobbies that he actually enjoyed. Johnny's mother would spoil him with food in an attempt to make up for his father's abuse since he became overweight. There's parents who are constantly arguing and it would often escalate into flights. When his father drank, he would beat Johnny and his sisters with a leather and raise a strap. For many years. The children would cry out in pain, but one day during a particularly bad wedding, it was like a switch just flipped and Johnny's brain. He stopped crying and he hardly even flinched. This only made us father more angry and he proceeded to beat him even harder. One day, Johnny passed out when he was playing with his friends and he was taken to the hospital where they diagnosed him with a heart condition and with that it was official.

Speaker 1:          03:13          John Wayne Gacy would never be an athlete. No matter how hard his father pushed him to play sports, he could not physically handle running without his heart. Just giving out. In 1954 Johnny joined the boy scouts and he became good friends with a boy called Barry, but Shelly, Johnny felt that he could trust Barry with his biggest secret. He stole a pair of panties and a bra from his mother's bedroom. When he was alone, he would dress up as a woman and stares at himself in the mirror. Sometimes he would put on lipstick and I wonder if he really should have been born a girl. There was clear that Johnny was questioning his gender identity and his sexuality. It must have been obvious to the rest of his family too because John Senior would often say that he would rather his son be dead than find out he was a homosexual. Even though his father was clearly abusive, Johnny was still desperate to be the son. His father always wanted these, started to date girls and tried to have a normal life, but he was bullied in school for being overweight. Since having his heart condition, it would seem that no matter how hard he tried to suppress it, John Wayne Gacy could never fit into the world that he was born into.

Speaker 1:          04:17          As soon as he graduated from high school, John Wayne Gacy was 18 years old sins. He wants you to get as far away from his hometown as he possibly could. He moved to the city of Springfield where he became a shoe salesman in a department store. After work, he became the assistant precinct captain for the Democratic Party. He started dating one of his coworkers, Marion and Meyers. Her father was wealthy and well connected in Springfield politics. Gacy. Told his friends and family that someday he wants it to become the governor of Illinois and maybe even the presidents of the United States. A few years later, he married Marilyn Mazda's. He was far from a faithful partner on the day Marilyn was in the hospital giving birth to their first child. John Wayne Gacy was at a bar with one of his male coworkers. They got drunk and went back to gacys house and had sex. Just a few hours later, his first child was born.

Speaker 1:          05:02          John Senior came to see his new grandchild's and for the first time in John Wayne Gacy his life, his father said that he was proud of him. John's new father in law owns several KFC restaurant franchises or 24 he left his job selling shoes and became a manager of one of these restaurants. According to his best friend, Barry. Gary at wanted the job very badly because he wanted to be able to control people. John Wayne Gacy continued to climb the ladder with local politics. He was always studying people around him and trying to figure out how he could make everyone liked him. He built a full service bar in the living room of his house and he convinced his wife that they needed to throw swingers parties together. If you're not aware, this is where couples would show up and switch spouses for the night. This was popular back in the 1960 since everyone was raving about the new free love movements.

Speaker 1:          05:46          The gay were also known to host massive orgies and they're hiring these sex parties made John Wayne Gacy popular almost immediately until he became the vice presidents of the local council. They also voted as a man of the year at the time, homosexual men usually led double lives. Whenever they wanted to have gay sags, they would start cruising. Men would take a walk in the park or down the road late at night waiting for another man to approach. They would have sex scenes often would never see one another again. However, since he was a public figure, it's possible that John Wayne Gacy thought that it would be too risky to have sex with any adult who might know who he is. He decided to go out to people that he felt he could easily control. The invited a 15 year old boy named Donald Voy. Here's over to his house, the new Donald, because he worked with his father who was a local senator.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Donald's looks up to John like a cool older brother ends. He offered to let Donald drink alcohol and cs porn collection. After the boy he got drunk. He forced Donald to have oral sex with him when it was over at Gacy threatened the boy by saying that he had connections with the mob. If he ever told anyone he would send someone to kill him and his family. When Gacy dropped Donald Hall, here's off at home, he gave him $50 in exchange for the boys. Silence don't. Overall, he has kept that night to secret for a very long time, but he was never at the same again. In 1968 he broke down and told his family what had happened. When he was 15 John Wayne Gacy was arrested for sodomy. He swore that he did not do it and asked for a lie detector test. He was convinced that he could fool the test, but he ultimately failed when he was called out on this line.

Speaker 1:          07:13          He tried to claim that the sex with Donald was consensual. Several of the teenage boys then came forward to say that there had been raped by an Gacy as well. He was found guilty and do a sentence to 10 years in prison. His wife divorced him and she did not want him to see their children. Never again. Now, this could have been the end of it all, but unfortunately Gacy used his charm to schmooze his way into the hearts of everyone in the prison. Once he was behind bars, he made friends with other inmates as well as the gods. Since he had experience working a KFC, he was able to become the head chef in the kitchen. He received a lot of praise, but knowing how to properly spice food and Z was even interviewed for a local television program called Christmas at an a Mosa.

Speaker 3:          07:51          Oh, I've been here now a year and up to weeks. You know, you pick up right here. Hello. I hope to be getting out of time and me

Speaker 1:          08:03          all of his father's phase, no bed come true. John Xenia died as soon as this son went to prison. John Wayne Gacy believed that his father, he died from shame. He became so angry that he lashed out his anger on any gay man he came into contact with. While in prison he spotted two men having oral sex, so he bashed in one of the men's faces and said it was bloody just by being found guilty for raping multiple boys. John Wayne Gacy was released after just 16 months on good behavior. He returned to cook county where he lived with his mum, people in his hometown. They didn't know about his conviction and they just remembered him as a young and innocent boy fat kid with a heart condition, so it was very easy for him to get a fresh start in life. He found a job as a short order cook and he saved up his money by working overtime.

Speaker 1:          08:43          Once he had enough money, he started a construction company called PDM contractors. He also jumps back into local politics. Newly divorced. Gary started dating a woman that he knew from high school called Carol Hoff. She was a cu with two daughters and she was struggling to make it on well for that. John Wayne Gacy was great around kids and the had a steady job and it was also ambitious from Carol's perspective. He was a catch and his daughter started to call him daddy right away. He admitted to Carol that he was bisexual, but he never told her about his time in jail. She accepted him for who he was and in that moment he had everything, but he was never satisfied. In fact, he felt that had been in prison so long is craving to have sex with teenage boys that only been amplified.

Speaker 1:          09:28          One night's John Wayne Gacy was hanging out at the Greyhound bus station. He spotted a 16 year old's name is Tim Mccoy, who was traveling during Christmas time and had a brief layover in Chicago. Gacy started flirting with him and his offer to show them around the city. Tim So assumes that this was just a typical cruising fling. They had sex, but Casey was angry at himself for giving into his homosexuality. He impulsively grabbed a kitchen knife and stabs him in the chest multiple times. He buried the boy in the debasement crawlspace underneath his house. Tim's parents never saw him for Christmas. Indeed, it would be years before they found out about the fate of their son. John Wayne Gacy got married to Carol seven months later and she moved into the house with her daughters. His new wife would have no idea that she was moving into a house where the remains of a young buyer were buried right below her feet.

Speaker 1:          10:14          John Wayne Gacy continued to suppress as homosexual urges. Instead of putting on lipstick, though he started to paint his face in clown makeup. Normally clown does have friendly curved features, but Gacy painted on sharp harsh edges. He called himself at pogo the clown and started showing up at the local hospital to do magic tricks for the children who were sick when he was pogo. He got to do all the things that John was not allowed to do. This escalated to giving into as indulgences. Again, burying his victims in the basements. John's wife, Carol, was concerned because she could tell that his personality had drastically changed after he began to play Pogo, John refused to have sex with her. He made her feel worthless. They filed for divorce in 1975 when he was 33 years old. After that, he was free to hunt teenage boys as often as he wanted.

Speaker 1:          10:59          He would drive around town dressed in his full clown makeup. If he saw a boy walking alone at night, he would hold up a gun and forced them into the car. He would rape and stab them before burying them again in the basement. Burying all of those bodies. It was hard work. So he brought in one of his new employees, David Cram, to dig holes in the basements. The claims that he needed to add a new piping under the house, but he was under strict orders to avoid certain areas of the basement. David had no idea that John Wayne Gacy was forcing him to dig his own grave crime was from out of town and he told Gacy that he was looking for new apartments. Gacy offered to rent in one of the bedrooms of his house in exchange for Labor one night though pogo the clown walk through the door and David Cram was confused.

Speaker 1:          11:41          John was already drunk and his makeup was sliding off his face. He wasn't acting like John Anymore. He spoke in a nasally high pitched voice like a clown, and to ask David if he wants it to my tie, David and assumes that this was some kind of joke. So he agreed to drinks. Pogo asked if he would like to see a magic trick and he put handcuffs on David's risks. He dangled the cane. Friends of him giggling like a child, pogo the clown men started poking. David's saying, does this get you mad? What about this? Huh, Huh. David then threatened to punch him if he didn't stop it. Gacy never broke character in the middle of a sentence. Pogo started grounding and barking like a dog. Then he started saying, in a Singsong your voice, I'm going to rape you. Over and over. He tried to force David down onto the floor or attempting to rip off his pants. David kicked Gacy as hard as he could and the clown fell to the floor dropping the key to the handcuffs. David was able to escape from the house, but he never spoke a word of this incidence to anyone until many years later. Others though it wouldn't be so lucky to escape.

Speaker 4:          12:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:46          John Wayne Gacy is loss noon. Victim was a 15 year olds named Robert piece to work at a desk. Planes Pharmacy. Gacy had spotted the boy and a previous shopping trips, so he showed up at the pharmacy asking to speak to the owner. He offered to renovate their pharmacy and casually asked if he knew of any teenage boys who were looking for a job because he was willing to pay $5 an hour for construction work. Robert Priest took the bait. This was double what he made at the pharmacy. You so he called up gacys company to apply later as he left the house piece smother. Ask him where he was going. He said, some contractor wants to talk to me about a job and he left. His mother never saw Hassan again. At this point, Gacy had run out of room in his basement. There were already 27 corpses beneath his house, so pogo the clown, he have to dump it.

Speaker 1:          13:30          Robert Body in the river. When the police found Robert Spotty, it was easy for them to take testimonies and connect the dots. They approached John Wayne Gacy, but he was confident that he would not be caught. He even invited the investigators over to his house for dinner and drinks. One of the officials could smell the stench of rotting corpses coming up through the evidence. They came back with another Warren sins, uncovered the bodies of the teenage boys in the basements. When John Wayne Gacy was brought into custody, the police were preparing to take his mugshots. They were asking him basic information like his name and his birthdate, and officer asked him, where were you born? Gacy replied out of chaos. He started to laugh at his own joke. The camera flash did. That very moment is capturing the image of a murderer who was truly pleased with himself when they found the bodies.

Speaker 1:          14:12          Gacy knew that he was done. He quickly claims that he had multiple personality disorder and that he had no control over what pogo the clown did, but clearly he had planned rob piece. It's murder for a long time after a psychological evaluation. It was obvious to anyone that he was just trying to plea insanity, but that he seemed to be fully aware of what he was doing during his trial, and Casey had the best defense team. Anyone could ask for it because of his ties to local governments. When he received the death penalty, he actually congratulated his team as this was the result he wanted. All along. While in prison, John Wayne Gacy began to draw pictures of clowns and sold his artwork. During every interview he did behind bars, Gacy claims that he was innocent and refuse to take blame for any of his actions. I want point even decided to write a book where he claimed that the bodies in his basement, we're part of a set up to ruin his political career.

Speaker 1:          14:58          May the 10th, 1994 was the day of his execution. Crowds of people stood outside the prison, Sean's and kill him, kill him, uh, holding up signs when it was announced that he had died from lethal injection. The crowds, Chad immediately following his death, forensic psychologists dissected gacys body and removed his brain. They wanted to see if there were any abnormalities. There might give them some kind of clue as to why he had become a serial killer, but there was nothing to be found. Even to this day. Experts, it's still debating on how to diagnose John Wayne Gacy. He has been called a sociopath or psychopath, a paranoid schizophrenia, some of agreed with his self-diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder. What we know for sure though, is that if it were not for all the shame he endured or Liz life, these killings may never have happened in the first place. So I hope you found that video. Interesting.
