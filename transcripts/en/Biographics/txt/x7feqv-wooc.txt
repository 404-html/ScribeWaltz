Speaker 1:          00:28          Queen Victoria Earl's. I have a Great Britain for 63 years and she has still remembered as being one of the most influential monarchs in history when it comes to the life of Queen Victoria. Biographers are actually very lucky because she wrote journals and letters documenting her daily life from the time she was a teenage girl all the way through to our death. Therefore, we know exactly what she was experiencing in her own words. However, when she was close to death, she also said doors, a bare trust at edit and rewrite many of our journals and destroy much of the original text that might offend members of our family. After her death, the children took it upon themselves to burn certain chunks of our life that they were embarrassed of. Because of that, we have the image of her. That's how children wanted us to see who was known as the widow of Windsor and spent her entire life mourning the death of her husbands, but our life. It was far more interesting than she's often given credit for

Speaker 1:          01:25          Victoria. His grandfather was George the third. He was the reigning King of England's during a youth. Pat Father was Prince Edward, the Duke of Kensington Mother Victoria of sacs called [inaudible] was born in Germany before she became the Duchess of Kent. Prince Edward would have become the next king. He died when Victoria was very young, leaving her to be the only legitimate adds to the throne. Victoria grew up knowing that one day she would become the next queen of England. By the time women were never trusted with their own finances. To make matters worse, the Duchess of Kent, evenly spaced gem and, but she was expected to raise an English queen. So a man named John Conroy was appointed as the comptroller of the lives of Victoria and her mother Conan right, took his duty much further than just being an accountant. He would send opportunists to Seoul this as a chance to have a powerful position in the government since pushed for control over the way Victoria was raised and it lots of ways.

Speaker 1:          02:16          He became almost like a talent agents for a child star. From an outsider's perspective, it would seem the young Victoria, she had the perfect life. She was raised in the beautiful home of Kensington Palace with toys clay or the sevens and vacations broad, but in a journals. Victoria often wrote that she had a very unhappy challenge it together with a mother, Conroy created strict rules known as the Kensington System. The main goal of its designed was to make Victoria Week and completely incapable of doing anything on her own. She was always in the company of a chaperone wherever she went. Instead of going to school, she had a governess to Zaha and she was never allowed to play with other children. This was an extremely lonely knife and she desperately wants to friends Conroy and Victoria's mother. They hopes this if they broke the princess down enough, they could turn it into a puppet that was easy to control.

Speaker 1:          03:07          As a teenager, Conroy arranged for a tour on a train so the Victoria could see every major city in the UK. She was forced to try and memorize every single person's name and title at every dinner party. Considering these dinner parties where massive task, it was always going to be a failure. Conroy would reprimand her saying that she was too stupid to be queen. Needless to say, the demands and the constant onslaught of insults made a completely miserable. In 1835 she was visiting the town of Ram's gate and she became very ill with typhoid fever. Conroy accused her of being lazy and being a liar. He said that she was faking her illness in order to get out of the tour, but she truly was sick and she was lying in bed in a hotel. John Coleman right burst into that hotel room with a piece of paper and hands.

Speaker 1:          03:51          He said that she would be a horrible queen and demanded the tree Sinoway have power to him so that he could be her personal secretary. This would have made him king by proxy because he would have had an absolute power over all of her affairs. She was just 16 years old at the time and she spend her entire life being broken down to feel completely worthless, but she still had the strength to say no to this. When she was 18 Victoria was awoken in the middle of the night by her mother and she learns that her grandfather, he was dead. She came downstairs to find the entrepreneurship of Canterbury kneeling in front of her and just like that. She was the queen of Great Britain.

Speaker 1:          04:34          On the day of Queen Victoria's coronation, the prime minister, Lord Melbourne, was so moved by the beauty of the ceremony that he had tears in his eyes. He congratulated her and told her that she was going to do a wonderful job. He looks as high with fatherly pride, which was something that she had never experienced in her life. Victoria knew that she could trust him. The prime minister became a new father figure, runs her very first friends. They would spend a lot of time together doing jigsaw puzzles and taking long walks. She often wrote that his sense of humor was her favorite thing about him and that he would often make her laugh. However, in public she was forced to put on a serious face, often becoming Queen Victoria moved into Buckingham Palace and she decided to never speak to her mother. All Lord Conroy again that plans who controller, it'll completely backfired.

Speaker 1:          05:17          She hated both of them and was glad to finally have her independence. However, that did not stop Lord Conroy from continuing to try and slither his way back into power. He approached Lord Melbourne claiming that the queen promised him a pension of 3000 pounds a year as well as a title, some lands and a seat and caught Melbourne gave into Conroy's demands. After hearing about his line is Victoria at dismissed board corn Rye, but he continued to work for the Duchess of Ken's while they plotted the next move when Lord Melbourne's time is prime minister was over and he was voted out of office Victoria. She was devastated. She wrote a mounted in a journals with so much drama or is it was almost as if he had died. Robert Peale became the next prime minister. Runt. He treats head like a stupid girl, just like John Conroy hat. He was part of the Tory, but as a grill party. So he demanded the Victoria dismiss her ladies in waiting because they were members of the Whig party, Victoria's bed chamber maids. They were her dearest friends. So she was outraged at the suggestion that she should follow them over politics. She flat out refused to continue to obey peels orders after all, she was the queen, so he didn't really have any rights to make demands of her. Robert Hill was so frustrated that he could not control it. There's, he actually resigned from being prime minister. This incident became known as the bedchamber crisis.

Speaker 2:          06:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:35          Even though Victoria's mother and John Conroy, we're no longer on speaking terms with her. They were still trying to give more power to the German part of the family. They're instructed Prince Albert's, her first cousin. It's a quarter with the plots to get their family more control over the throne. Victoria had only met Alberto ones before and by the time they were both 20 years old, she was shocked at how handsome had grown up to be. She ran home so rice in her journal about how attractive he was and how her heart was pounding. Victoria had no idea that her mother had plans. This clandestine meeting with Albert's Miss. They truly did fall in love with one another. She was head over heels in love and as the Queen, she was the one to ask Albert to marry her in her diary. There are so many intimate details about their honeymoon and it might as well be a romance novel.

Speaker 1:          07:19          Victoria at became pregnant just a month after our wedding. She was in constant pain and very hormonal. She struggled a lot with pregnancy and she was extremely critical of herself falling into a serious depression. Victoria would write in a diary about how guilty she felt every time she lost her temper. She would often writes that her husband was perfect since she hated herself for being anything but sweet and so loving towards him at all times. Little did the queen. No, this was all parts of an extension of Conroy and the Duchess of Kent Kensington Plan. Allbirds German family instructed him to keep getting her pregnant so that she would remain a week and never have time to truly learn how to rule on her own. She rode the pregnancy, made a miserable, but they had a total of nine children together. Unfortunately, Victoria did not like her kids very much. Motherhood's it was simply something she was not ready for and she suffered from a lot of postpartum depression for all of those years.

Speaker 1:          08:08          She stated she had a lowness and the tendency to cry. It is what every lady suffers with moral less what I during my first confinements suffered dreadfully with.

Speaker 1:          09:57          In the year 1861 queen Victoria's mother died of cancer. Despite all the drama that had gone on between the two of them, she regretted not spending more time with a mother. She realized that John Conroy was the true villain here and she regretted not taking action to repair their relationships sooner. That same year though, her husband Albert, he also died. She was 42 years old and suddenly the closest people in their life, they were gone after his death. She continued to sleep next to a picture of him and have the sevens lay out his clothes on the bed every morning even though he wouldn't be there to get dressed. Whenever someone asked her to make a decision, she would accidentally say, I'll have to ask Albert's as her. She had forgotten or was in denial about his death. Victoria, she already struggles with mental illness, but these deaths, they made it follow us.

Speaker 1:          10:41          They bill whispered that she may have inherited the Hanoverian madness off to rule. There was so much inbreeding going on and that part of a family that it shouldn't be surprising those all of them were known for being a bit nuts. She dressed in black at all times and acted completely melodramatic. She write letters on paper with a black border to signify that she was in mourning instead of staying in Buckingham Palace. She went on long holidays and Germany in a diary. She right that she wished she could have a normal life and she could live in Germany with albus without having to be queen at this points, everyone begins. Cool, Huh? The widow of Windsor, for the rest of our life, Victoria wore black every single day. She went on one of the longest periods of mourning in history. People thought that this was tragically romantic, so they become fascinated with death. Suddenly it was fashionable to enjoy spooky and creepy things, and this inspired a great deal of amazing culture during the Victorian era. Now most people think that this is a story ends and she remains a very sad and serious woman for the rest of the days, but the reality is is that she was able to heal and she learned to love her life. Once again

Speaker 1:          11:48          after returning to the United Kingdom and Victoria and met a Scottish man named John Brown when she was 45 old brown had been Prince Albert's assistant whenever he visited Scotland, so he was there to pay his respects. Instead of seeing her just as the queen, he could see that Victoria was an incredibly lonely woman and all she really needed in our life. It was a friends. The two of them would get into long conversations where she pulled out all of the feelings that she had kept secrets or just only recent in her diaries for a very long time. Brown had a lot of sympathy for her. Runs became devoted to serving hat. He swore that he would never leave aside and take care of her every need. The greatest gift John Brown gave a was his personality. He was loud, he was rude. It was almost always drunk.

Speaker 1:          12:28          He would drink whiskey, something some into Victoria's drink saying, don't stay thirsty. No one had made Victoria at loft so much and years and she absolutely loved it. The ticket became best friends and even possibly lovers. If Brown disagreed with something he did, he would yell, woman, what are you doing? I'll look as shocked at his level of disrespect, but she actually enjoyed it very much. No one had ever dent to talk to her like that. So Teresa, like a normal person. Her entire life, everyone had treated her like she was weak and stupid, but John Brown, he knew how smart and strong she truly was saying he held to a higher standard. That friendship, it lifted our spirits house. I've had depression and she was the happiest. She had been in a very long time. All their life. Victoria was rising in our journals every single day and she was an avid reader.

Speaker 1:          13:14          She made a decision to do something that no other Monique has ever done before. Become an author. Queen Victoria published a book called leaves from the Journal of our lives in the highlands, which was full of access from our own personal journal about a friendship with John Brown and how he changed my life. It became a best seller and sold over a hundred thousand copies. She even gave a dedication to drawn Brown's muscular legs, which peaked out of his kilt that kids, they were embarrassed, but then again any kid would feel embarrassed of them. Other wrote about those things and then publish them off to a death. Victoria Victoria's daughter Beatrice deleted all mention of John Brown when she was rewriting Victoria's journals because that relationship was considered to be Yay Trudy humiliating stain on the royal family, but of course she couldn't alter raise him from history. Queen Victoria had commissioned statues to be made and John Brown's on errands, plenty of people who witnessed them together when he was alive.

Speaker 1:          14:02          Victoria and John held hands together and hugged one another in public and so of course there was also the book she published about that friendship. There is also a remit. They were secretly lovers Victoria and they'd show the snaps in conjoining bedrooms and dead children called him mamma's love up on his deathbed. The Queen's personal chaplain referenced Norman Cloud confessed that he married Queen Victoria and John Brown in secret ceremony is they said, and we would learn that he gave her his mother's engagement ring. Tragically though she outlived Brown too, even though he was several years younger than hot. He died at age 56 so she lost yet another man in her life that she truly loved. In 1997 a movie called Mrs. Brown was made to dramatize that love story. Despite the evidence there are still historians. He refused to believe that Queen Victoria would marry a common name like John Brown and if she had the things, you would have been brave enough to let the world know instead of keeping it a secret. Unfortunately, we never know all the details because there've been lost forever.

Speaker 1:          15:01          As we mentioned before, Queen Victoria was incapable of running a government's on our own and she was known for being a bit off her rocker. The decisions she made were usually based on her personal preferences rather than politics. Prime Minister Gladstone, he was very serious and you didn't have any sense of humor. It's whole. So of course Victoria, how you just him. They would write nasty letters back and forth to one another even though they both would have done Buckingham Palace and could have easily spoken to one another face to face the next prime minister Disraeli. It has a much better sense of humor and treated her with respect. He would compliment how orange treat her like the role she wants. Disraeli lovingly called her the fairy queen and gave her the title empress of India. Queen Victoria had never been to India in her entire life, but it's often being given the title.

Speaker 1:          15:43          She sat down and learn as much about the country as she possibly could. She hired a tutor named Abdul Kareem so that she could learn to speak the Indian language Hindustani in how notebooks. She took notes every time she asked him how to save for the Taisha, so dirty things. Crim became a new favorite seven since he was given the title of the Munchy or the teacher. Victoria allows him to go with her everywhere, even when she was on holiday compared to the loud John Brown. The people in Queen Victoria is course well, actually relieves the, her new favorite servant was at least a soft spoken and a real gentleman. They saw this as a huge improvements. However, the Curran soon began to get showered with gifts and gained a lot more privileges. Plenty of people were concerned the Victoria was going to be taken advantage off and that she was making poor decisions, often wielding a good two's.

Speaker 1:          16:25          I didn't exactly qualify Kareem to become someone who held a position of power, but the moments, anyone questions, anything to do with career, she would accuse them of being racist. Abdul Karim was always getting sick and it turns out that he had gotten gonorrhea, but of course if the Raul physician got frustrated at Victoria would pull the race card. Once again. He came with a on vacation and the Riviera runs the newspapers described in this a seventh she writes me a letter to the newspaper and demanded that they retract. Then I'll story and submit a correction. Abdul Karim was an educated gentleman and to and secretary. While she was incredibly eccentric. There is no doubt this once anyone became Queen Victoria's friends, she was fiercely loyal and it's made sure they lived that best life.

Speaker 3:          17:06          Hm.

Speaker 1:          17:12          At 81 years old, Queen Victoria out plans for her death and when she had a hemorrhagic stroke, they knew how to per Patho have funeral. Throughout that life, Queen Victoria had been given precious jewels, but they meant nothing to her in those final days. She told her doctors that what she wanted was a number of sentimental items with her in a coffin. First was Albert's dressing gown, which she had in their bedroom all of those years. Next, well, the photos of the children as well as the locks of their hair that she had collected from their first hack outs. She requested to have a framed photograph of John Brown in our hands. Lang over our heart on her finger. She wore an engagement ring that belongs to John Brown's mother, Queen Victoria. His took place on February. The second is 1901 despite it being in the middle of winter, thousands of people showed up to mourn and it became one of the largest funerals in history.

Speaker 1:          17:57          She never let the country three war or haven't made any substantial improvements in politics, but people, they loved her all the same. So many prime ministers came and went during Victoria's reign. There have been all but forgotten. You could say that they were some of the first true influences. Everything they did caused a ripple effect for the rest of society and Queen Victoria was no exception. In fact at life was so colorful this and we think of the Victorian era. We truly do gas, a very vivid image of that time period in our minds, the clothes, the style and the attitude of the people that would just like the queen, serious on the outside and wild on the inside. It's delicious. Lee Romantic and yet very dark at the same time. That time period is still popular to this. Dan Queen Victoria is going to be remembered as one of the most impactful figures in history. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
