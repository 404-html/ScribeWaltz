Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is made possible by brilliant. You'll learn more about brilliant later in today's video, but if you'd like to learn more about the right now, you got a brilliant.org forward slash biographics. You'll also find a link in the description below. My Japanese pronunciation is not brilliant, so bear with me in this video. I have a computer here. I'm looking up the stuff when I can. Sometimes I fail. If you want to have a go at me in the comments, go right ahead. During World War Two, in the second Seleno, Japanese war dogs named Shiro issue was responsible for creating biological weapons of mass destruction is she built a laboratory in Manchuria cooled unit 7:31 on behalf of the Japanese government's. Its goal was to create a weapon so deadly. It could wipe out the population of Japan's enemies. He used nibbling Chinese villages as as human Guinea pigs for these bundled trickle weapons and experimented on men, women, and even children. When the war was over, the United States learned about Shiro Ishii sadistic experiments. While many of the Nazis were sentenced to death for that crimes against humanity. And Europe's concentration camps, Shero issue was allowed to go free. So what would drive someone to become one of the most evil men in history and why on earth we see it, I have to get away with mass murder. Well, that's what we're looking at in this week's by graphics.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Shiro Ishii was born in 1892 in a village called Shitty Yama in the Chiba Prefecture of Japan. His parents were wealthy landowners that came from a long line of Daimyos or feudal lords, who owns the most land in any given area. The Japanese system of prefectures or states have only just begun in the 1870. So his parents were very powerful and still had a lot of control over the government and the Chiba Prefecture. Throughout history, these wealthy landowners benefited from indentured servants who farms the fields and they weren't able to enjoy a lavish lifestyle even into the 19th century. These descendants of the dime year, we're still very much benefiting from their family's fortunes. At the same time, the Japanese people looked up to the emperor of Japan with a godlike admiration, even though they logically knew the imperial family were mortals, they still had a very strong sense of loyalty and they believe that the life of someone living in the lower class was truly not as valuable as someone from the optic loss.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Because of this Japanese mindset share real issue was raised to believe that he truly was far more important than most people know much else is known about his younger years. Except to say that it would seem like his path seems very linear. It is almost as if all of his life experiences were preparing him to experiment on human beings without any sense of remorse. Sure is. She studied medicine it Kyoto, imperial university, but he wasn't interested in becoming a doctor who heals the common people in a hospital. He became a surgeon for the Imperial Japanese army in 1920. One earns the rank of leftenant. His superiors were impressed with his surgical skill, so they sent him to the army medical school in Tokyo for further training. They also paid for him to start doing a postgraduate medicine program at Kyo to imperial university, even though he did become a medical doctor, like we said, he wasn't interested in healing.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Patients was far more fascinated with studying and experimentation. You had a particular love of biology and particularly bacteria. It used to grow deadly bacteria in petri dishes and he called them his pets in the 1920. [inaudible] finished his many years of medical school and went on a two year trip around the world to visit 30 countries. He was particularly fascinated with staying in Germany so that he could study the poison gasses that that romy used during World War One. Chlorine gas had been used as a weapon of war, but both sides began to use gas masks. As far as she was concerned, gas was no longer an effective means of killing another soldier.

Speaker 1:          04:00          In 1931, the Chinese territory of Manchuria was taken over by Japan during these seconds. Sino Japanese war, and this was a huge victory for Japan and they were already occupying Korea. They were feeling very confident that they could spread this embar to conquer the entire rest of China. Sure, if she saw this new Manchurian territory is a perfect opportunity for him to take his theoretical ideas of biological weapons and make them into a devastating reality, just like an evil villain in a bond movie. He was searching for a plague that was capable of wiping out the entire human race or at least the enemies of the Japanese empire. At this point, surely she had such a powerful position in the military and government that he was able to personally approach the emperor and request the funding to create an arbitrary in Manchuria. Off to that permission was granted.

Speaker 1:          04:51          He built a massive compounds called unit 7:31. It was officially called the epidemic prevention in water supply unit because its true purpose of studying biological weapons was supposed to remain a secret. They were given a huge budget which they spent on state of the art equipment unit 7:31 was similar to a Nazi concentration camp and that it was an entire campus of buildings which included holding cells, medical facilities, and a gigantic crematorium. The administration building where she worked with so strong, it was the last building left standing after being bombed. Yes, later, but of course you can't have human experimentation without test subjects. The Japanese can pace on military. Police would grab it, Chinese people off the streets of their villages on arrest them. They were put on trains that arrived at unit 7:31, and they were never allowed to see their families again. They captured all ages of men, women, and even young children because they wanted to see how these weapons affected all types of people.

Speaker 1:          05:50          According to the military doctors who worked there, they were forced to work at unit seven, 31 without really even knowing what they're getting themselves into. Upon arrival, they would find doctors, injecting Chinese people with a deadly disease like anthrax or you'd be bottleneck plague. If they spoke out against the experiments. It would be treason and they could be executed for us, for those who were forced to work in unit seven, 31, they had to believe that this was all just a part of war and killing the civilians was no different than bombing an enemy country. In fact, they believed that their actions were far more noble than the average soldier because they killed in the name of science. Doctors would dissect human beings while they were still alive without using any anesthetic. They wanted to see what organs look like while they were still functioning and to learn exactly how the disease would cause these organs to fail.

Speaker 1:          06:39          Some of the subjects were given a vaccine to the plague first before exposing them to the disease. This way, they were able to know exactly what the strongest vaccines were for the deadliest diseases in the wells. Once they affected the formula, they were able to create enough antidotes for all of Japan in this way. Unit 7:31 was making breakthroughs and modern medicine, but it was at the expense of a great many Chinese lives. They're holding cells. They were large enough that they could hold up to 600 people at a time. They called these people meritus, which means logs, which only further to humanize them. The average lifespan for these prisoners was only four to six weeks when their bodies were done being used. They were thrown in a pile and burned in the crematorium,

Speaker 1:          07:28          in his laboratory Sheria. She was experimenting with the Bubonic Plague, which is known for being one of the most deadly diseases in history, but he didn't want it to be the same place that we remember from the past. He genetically altered it to be extremely potent and far more capable of killing people than any previous strain of the plague. The bubonic plague can only be transferred through blood, so he wanted to release disease, written fleas on unsuspecting villages in order to test how strong it truly was. They collected ramps, which were perfect incubators for thousands upon thousands of fleas, and the insects were Catholic, gathered and put into containers. First round of experiments had airplanes dropping baskets full of fleas into Chinese villages, civilians, and it worked exactly as they had hoped. Between 1939 and 1942 plagues began to spread in these villages. One third of the total population of each village was wiped out.

Speaker 1:          08:20          These manufactured plagues were so potent that once they were infected people which is die within one to two days, according to testimony by a man named Gene [inaudible], his sister was infected with this mega plague after being bitten by one of the fleas. The glands in her neck was so swollen, it was as large as a hat. She knew that if she stayed inside and received medical treatment, she would in fact the rest of our family with the plague, so she had to go into the middle of a field and die alone. Their family members could not get near her and they had no choice but to burn her body in the field where she lay. While baskets full of fleas have worked with low flying planes, shearer, she knew that if he wanted to, in fact enemy countries, they would need to drop actual bombs filled with fleas.

Speaker 1:          09:03          The only issue was that the fleas would, of course, Diane, the explosion. He figured out that by creating clay pot containers, he could drop a so called germ bomb that would smash when it's at the grounds and the fleas would stay alive, but they didn't just stop at the bubonic plague. They experiments with anthrax and typhoid as well. After dropping these bombs on even more Chinese villages, the Japanese soldiers showed up in all the white lab suits covering their entire body. They would command villages to come out of their homes and they would find subjects who had been infected by the plague and performed dissections in the middle of a field while their friends and family watched on to share issue. It was all about gathering data and statistics. These people, they were just numbers on a page. They were not actual human life stem. The campaign were even given candy from unit 7:31 and instructed to show up to villages and hand out the Swedes to small children.

Speaker 1:          09:57          While Chinese villages interpreted this as an act of kindness, the Kenzie was actually laced with anthrax. The scientists would later arrive and observe parents beginning to panic as their children died in their arms. As time went on, the unit expanded their human experiments beyond diseases. They also did experiments on frostbite and the effects of shrapnel wounds. This involved strapping people down to a wooden plank before blowing up a bomb next to them. All of this was just so they could study how a human would be blown apart by different types of weapons, so I think now is probably a good time for a little breather. This one's a bit intense. I mean science. It's responsible for the devastation of lives as we're seeing in this video, but is also responsible for the saving of millions used the right way. Science changes the welds in remarkable ways for the better, and that's why I'm pleased in this video to tell you about brilliance and I know as always, these ads in the middle of their less than awesome but brilliance are fantastic for sponsoring this sort of longer content because it allows us to share the darker lessons from scientific history in a thoughtful way.

Speaker 1:          11:01          Brilliance on science learning platform that allow youtube learned through active learning, which summed up is basically the opposite of that feeling of reading a complex paragraph about some principle and then just having absolutely no clue what on earth was going on about even on the 10, three, three, and they don't just cover the basics, although they do cover those as well, but it goes through to really complex things like advanced statistics. I was recently going through a course on statistics, particularly the one lying with statistics. It's an amazing primer on how to be aware of when the media is misusing statistics to push your opinion one way or the other. Brilliant makes even complex statistical concepts, easy to understand. They give you something super short to read. It's very easy and then you immediately apply it to a problem and then you just rinse and repeat that and all of a sudden you're understanding things that you never thought you would be. I've been using brilliant for a while. You should just give it a go to see how easy it is to start understanding complex subjects so they support biographics going to brilliant.org, forward slash graphics, and now let's get back to abusing science.

Speaker 1:          12:08          Even though Shiraishi and unit seven, 31 had developed these deadly weapons, they never made this public knowledge or threatened to use the German bombs. Some historians believe that if the Americans knew about these bioweapons ahead of time, they would have never dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki for fear of mutual destruction. But if you think the allied powers were safe from the sadistic experiments going on in Manchuria well, think again. Sure. If she plans a long distance attack on the United States schools mission cherry blossoms at night. They attempted to launch balloons that were filled with deadly diseases like cholera. Smallpox in the bubonic plague is whether it's anthrax and botulism and estimated 9,000 balloons, web center across the Pacific Ocean, but only 345 of them actually made it to the United States. Many of them were shot down in some landed in the ocean or in forest. So fields considering there were a lot of Ufo sightings at the time.

Speaker 1:          13:02          It might be possible that some people were seeing these gen buildings and mistaking them for something else. It was actually only one of these, the course, any casualties. It landed in a town called bly, Oregon on May the fifth, 19, 45, a Sunday school teacher named Elsie Metro was on a day trip going on a picnic and the mountains with a small group of our teenage students, husbands, archie, who was also that minister was driving the car up the mountain. Elsie was a few months pregnant and she got sick during the car ride. Husband pulled over to better around to get some APP. They had parked near a crew of men who were doing construction work on the road. The students in llc decided to take a short walk through the woods and archie began to speak with the men. He then heard his wife's voice say, look what I found.

Speaker 1:          13:44          Yeah. Followed by an explosion lc. You had come across one of the balloons. She had no idea that it was actually a bomb and approaching it. She triggered the explosion archie in the crew. He ran towards the sounds and they found the bodies of LLC into group of students lying dead on the ground. Well, most Americans were kept safe from Sherry issues, experiments. Those who were stationed in Asia during World War Two, well, they weren't so lucky in 1944 and 1945 American prisoners of war. We're in a city called mud can. They were visited by Japanese doctors. Many of them had already been in captivity for several years at this point. The Japanese wanted to see if the results were any difference on different races and objected the men with various deadly diseases and repeated the exact experiments that were done on the Chinese. Many of these men died and the ones who survived were only kept around so they could carry away the bodies of their friends

Speaker 1:          14:42          when World War Two was over, the allied forces, one is that they took away power from Emperor Hirohito in Manchuria. China had defeated the Japanese as well. There was nowhere left for issued to hide Nazi war criminals. They were being brought to trial in Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946, and many of them were being sentenced to death for the crimes against humanity. The Japanese military still awarded Shero issue with medals of honor into healthy pension for his retirement. In their eyes, he was a hero for the country, but he knew that America would not feel the same, especially once they had the stories from the POW use Shiro Ishii commanded his doctors and soldiers to never speak of the experiments that went on in unit 7:31, but of course they learned about the experiments through the American soldiers who survived the American government's approached issue, but instead of arresting him, they asked to make a deal.

Speaker 1:          15:33          They wanted his data in exchange for immunity. Sure is. She knew that this was the only way he could save himself. He promised that if they pardoned all of his crimes, the US government could benefit from having all of the scientific information that they had gathered from their experiments. In the United States. There are ethical laws in place so that American scientists are never allowed to experiment on human beings by law. They can only experiments on animals. For this reason, the government knew that these experiments were truly valuable because it was information that they would never be able to receive on their own. It's one thing to inject a rat or a rabbit with a disease, but it's a totally different thing to actually know the results on human beings and more importantly, the Americans would gain access to the vaccines that it wishy develops some of the deadliest diseases known to mankind.

Speaker 1:          16:23          They agreed to trade his data in exchange for his life and they even paid him $250,000 and in modern money, that's about two point 6 million. All of the scientists and soldiers who were involved with unit seven, 31, we're happy to keep the secrets because they were deeply ashamed of their participation with a project. Some of them even felt too ashamed to return to Japan because they were afraid that people would learn about that. Crime's a few of them even trying to live in China, runs new identities. The New York Times tried to expose this by publishing an article about is human experiments in 1946, but the owns that the events gains for a little media attention since all of these atrocities happened in Nigeria, they were technically a part of the second signer, Japanese war, and not World War Two. Even though both wars were happening simultaneously for Americans, it was overshadowed by the thousands of testimonies coming out of Europe about the Holocaust, but of course the Chinese people, they have not forgotten.

Speaker 1:          17:20          Even to this day in many Chinese people still hate the Japanese for what happens during this war. However, most Japanese civilians were unaware of issues, human experiments, and they consider themselves to be mostly victims of the war. After the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese surrendered since there was never the chance for them to start a massive global plague. So what about those pow? In the 19 forties, governments, officials approached them and demanded that they sign a nondisclosure contract. They promised never to expose the truth about what had happened to them in Manchuria. However, in the 19 eighties, many of those soldiers felt that they had nothing left to lose and they came forward to testify that they had been a part of these human experiments. It wasn't until the 19 nineties that Japan officially acknowledged that unit 7:31 was real and it wasn't just a conspiracy theory.

Speaker 1:          18:11          Shiro Ishii Windsor live into old age and he died at the age of 67 even after the wars were over. That plagues that share wishy unleashed in China continue to spread and kill people for years to come is exact number of victims is unknown. Some estimate that he was responsible for tens of thousands, well, others say the number would be in the hundreds of thousands of people. So I really hope you found that video interesting.
