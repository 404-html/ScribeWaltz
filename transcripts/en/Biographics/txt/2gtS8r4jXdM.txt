Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is made possible by brilliant, so you're going to learn more about brilliant later in today's video, but if you'd like to learn more about them right now, you've got a brilliant.org/buyer graphics and also find a link in the description below. We're not behind for the annual prices that he gifted to the welds, but Alfred Nobel also left us with another legacy explosives. He was the inventor of dynamite and it's even more deadly incarnation. Jelic night. They made him rich beyond his wildest dreams, but also left him with a tortured conscience. In this week's biographics, we examine the life of Alfred Nobel Alfred Bernard Nobel

Speaker 1:          00:46          was born on August the 21st 1833 in Stockholm in Sweden. He was a sickly child. He almost died after the first week of his birth as it was. He was one of just four of eight children to survive. His illness kept him indoors while his three brothers played outside. Alfred's father Emmanuel was an inventor and he's an engineer, but he struggled to run lines. His ambitions as a result of the family. It struggled to get by just the three months prior to Alfred's, his birth, his father had been forced to declare bankruptcy and shut down his business. Emanuel was now being chased by creditors. Things that came almost unbearable when a fire ravaged the family home tells me against me to the Nobel children web sent out into the streets to sell matches. Alfred was an extremely pallet and sickly child. He suffered from epileptic convulsions along with a host of gastric diseases and debilitating migraine headaches.

Speaker 1:          01:36          For the first six years of his life, Alfred were schooled by his mother. He proved himself to be a gifted student from the start. By the age of three. He was able to read from that time onward. He was rarely seen without a book in his hand. He also had an amazing memory when Alfred was four years old, his father moved to Russia in order to pursue a business venture and manual had managed to get a meeting with the chairman of the Science Committee for the Promotion of Industry and trade. He steered the conversation towards lands mines, his area of expertise, and was able to secure an invitation to Turkey to meet some influential people and on your worked in Tokyo for two years where he invented the product. We know today as plywood. He then moved to Saint Petersburg. There he was introduced to son Nicholas the first season that the opportunity and told the czar about his plans to develop a submerged explosive mine. Nicholas immediately saw the potential to use the invention to prevent enemy ships from entering into Russian waters.

Speaker 2:          02:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Things are looking up for the Nobels with the money he received from the Russian government is compensation for his developments of the submerged explosive mine and manual setup, a mechanical workshop and Armaments Factory as well as making the new mind. The factory also produced industrial tools and cannon shells in 1842 when Alfred was nine years old, manual send for his family join him from Stockholm. The new life of the Nobels was vastly different to what they're known in Sweden. That's and Peter's bag house was luxurious in comparison to their old home and manual was now able to hire a tutor for his sons. Unlike his brother's Alfred was studious and intellectual. He was also intensely curious about the world around him. He loved the poetry of Percy Shelley, especially those concerns with the subjects of nature and justice. From these readings, he developed a deep desire to stand up to injustice.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Alfred's other loves where chemistry and languages. By the time he was 17 he could speak five languages. His father also recognized in the by a natural affinity for solving problems. Marking Alfred is the most promising of his sons to follow in his inventive steps. The boy loved nothing better than to spend his time and his father's factory silently taking in everything that his dad was doing before long. His father allowed him to handle the chemicals himself. Alfred Street has encouraged his passion for chemistry and literature. At the same time, they coaxed him to come out of his shell socially, largely as a result of his l healthy was a painfully shy and introverted boy. Yup. With the help of his tutors. He began to stretch himself academically and his mid teens. He had a gun participating in debate in clubs and started to share his passions with family members. Then around the age of 15 he had a growth spurt which puts him at the height of most of his peers. This went a long way to boost his confidence. In 1850 Emmanuel paid for Alfred deep study in Paris. He had already been studying with chemists and Nikolai is in and it was chemistry that he pursued in France.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Empower Paris, offered spend time with Ascanio subreddit Rowe who had recently invented nitroglycerin. Breira was totally opposed to any commercial use of his invention due to its highly unpredictable explosive potential, in fact, in later life and made the following statements about his invention. When I think of all the victims kills during nitroglycerin explosions and the terrible havoc that it wreaks, which in all probability will continue to occur in the future. I'm almost ashamed to admit to being it's discover up. Sabrina is a version two is discovery did not put off young. No Bell. In fact, the reverse history, the substance fascinated Alfred Nobel and met a chemist by the name of Jules Pelosi, who was fascinated with nitroglycerin and had a determination to bring it under control. After a year in France, Alfred went into the United States to pursue his studies that he worked with. Swedish invented Jon Erickson. Erickson would go on to gain fame as the inventor of ironclad warships used in the civil war, as well as the inventor of this group.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Propeller Erickson, Phil's Alfred's minds with dreams of what he could do if he was able to team the nitroglycerin. After a year in America, Alfred returned to some peaches bag. It's probably recognized a changed young man. His brother Ludvig recalls Alfred to grown so that I hardly knew him. He has almost as tall as I and his voice has become so deep and strong that I didn't recognize it, but Alfred did more than change physically. The young man who had left with lots of ideas but little direction now had a goal to turn nitroglycerin into a commercially usable blasting agents for use in tunnels and to create fear, inspiring weapons of war that were so terrible that nations would be deterred from ever going to war in the first place. First though, Alfred had to come to the help of the family. He works alongside his brothers and one of his father's factories, but the physical work proved too much for his weekend body.

Speaker 1:          06:26          He was often too sick to work and on one occasion in 1854 he became so unwell that his father passed him off to the spa town of friends and bad to recuperate by now in manuals business, it was flourishing is submerged explosive. Mine was in high demands along with other munitions. Do you supply the Russian forces in fighting? The Crimean war of 1853 through 1856 by 1853 Emmanuel was employing more than a thousand people in his factories and the Russian government was so pleased with him that they awarded him the imperial gold medal in recognition of his diligence and creative skill in Russian industry in between overseeing years manufacturing and buyer Emmanuel found time to collaborate with Alfred on the nitroglycerin problem, but even in manual with his vast experience could not find a safe way to detonate the substance. The ends of the Crimean war in 1856 saw a sharp downtown in business for the Nobel Company and I knew what was forced to change his focus from armaments productions you shining out household and industrial implements, but still the business suffered by 1859 and manual. Found himself facing bankruptcy for the second time. He closed the factory, liquidators his assets and moved with his wife and youngest son and mill back to Sweden. Alfred and his two older brothers loot Vegan Robert stayed on and some Peter's bag. 28 year old Ludvig was given the job of consolidating and running the remnants of the Nobels Russian operation. He rebranded the company as the Ludvig Nobel mechanical factory. Alfred spends about four hours each day helping out with the family business the rest of the day. He worked on his passion to team Nitroglycerin.

Speaker 1:          08:06          Alfred's first step was to learn to create nitroglycerin himself by 1861 year to accomplish that goal after spending up to 18 hours a day in a small factory building. The first breakthrough came when he discovered how to transport a nitroglycerin safely by first soaking yet and coldest. Now, suddenly Nitroglycerin was a viable explosive engineering companies from all over the world came to the Nobel company to purchase the products and as the money started rolling in Alfred's next challenge was to find a safe way to designate the nitroglycerin. And September of 1864 though tragedy struck the Swedish Nobel company factory. A Vat of Nitroglycerin had been overheated and the resulting explosion five people were killed, including Alfred's younger brother and mill. Alfred himself was working in the next building, anti suffered minor injuries and the disaster rather than being pushed off from working with Nitroglycerin. Alfred threw himself into making the explosive safer to give up now would be in his view to allow his brother to have died in vain.

Speaker 1:          09:04          In 1865 he built a factory in Hamburg, Germany. It's so happens that the soil arounds the Hamburg factory and we're special. It's contained. Minute particles are fossils. When nitroglycerin was poured into the style, it turns into a dewy consistency. This process and affects puts the Nitroglycerin to sleep in order to wake it up for detonation purposes. Nobel bell invented the blasting cap. Alfred knew that a fuse could not be used directly to detonate nitroglycerin bus. That gunpowder could be used to detonate it a few years could be used to designate the gunpowder, which would then ignite the nitric restaurant. By 1867 he had mastered the use of Small Cup of capsules of Mercury fulminate, which was ignited by a fuse to detonate the nitroglycerin. This blasting cap would wake up the Nitroglycerin, which was packed into a doe soil base, Nobel calls the combination of nitroglycerin blasting and soil dynamite, Nobel patented dynamite and began putting it on the commercial market. It was an immediate success with engineers from all over the world clamoring to get their hands on it. Virtually overnight Alfred became rich. Beyond his wildest dreams.

Speaker 1:          10:16          We can get an idea of how much money came in by an anecdote, apparently true concerning his house maids wedding when Alfred Asta what she would like as a gift. The various astute go replied as much as you make in a day. The following day, Nobel gave her a check for $100,000 Alfred and self never married, but he did have at least three great loves throughout his life. While living in Russia in his early twenties he fell for a Russian Gal by the name of Alexandria, painfully shy. He finally built up the gumption to tell the girl how he felt about her, but his affections, what roundly rejected the rebuff, hurting badly, and for the next 20 years he refused to let his heart be broken again. Nobel consciously portrayed himself as a [inaudible], an eccentric he wants to rate the following about himself. I'm a misanthrope, yet utterly benevolence. Have more than one screw loose.

Speaker 1:          11:06          Yes, I'm a super idea. This two digests philosophy more efficiently than the food. Even though he had money to purchase literally anything he wanted, Alfred was rather frugal. This may have been a reflection of the extreme poverty that he had experienced in his childhood. He had no interest in purchasing such tokens of wealth is elegant carriage clothing or food, but would invest liberally in new estates and business ventures. Nobel was known to have a temper and he was a man who did not suffer fools with many occasions being recorded where he was rude with people. Usually those who worked for him, he was a get to the point type of guy. Yeah. Do you also have the ability to charm potential investors when the need warranted it. In 1870 Alfred apparently

Speaker 2:          11:54          tired of his life of solitude and placed an advertisement in the newspaper that read as follows, wealthy, highly educated gentleman seeks Lady of mature age vast in languages as secretary and supervisor of households. After interviewing a number of applicants, Alfred employed a woman by the name of birth or sky, 33 year olds. Bertha was extremely attractive and Nobel was immediately attracted to up. It was also taken with obvious intelligence and wit that's birth. It did not return her employers a factions. In fact, she already had a fiance or after a few months probably feeling and that he is with the situation. She resigned, doesn't Nobel's secretary still the two remained friends and they maintained an active letter correspondence right up until the time of Nobels deaf. She in fact became the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1905 some weeks after birth or left his employee, Nobel Matt, a young woman by the name of Sophie has, despite the fact that Alfred was 43 and Sophie was just 20 they entered into a relationship. There was the last for 18 years, apparently embarrassed by the age gap. Nobel kept their relationship a secret, the age difference with not the only thing that seemed to work against the relationship. Sophie was uncouth and educated and it'll manage their relationship. It was a toxic one. In 1891 Sophie became pregnant to another man, but Alfred held out hope for their relationship until she married the child's father. Three years later, even then, he sent her an annual allowance of 6,000 Florence Nobel

Speaker 1:          13:24          never had any children. Despite his immense wealth. He filled his days with work, often going nonstop for 20 hours. In 1875 he invented Jelic nights, which proved to be a safer explosive than dynamite. In the late 1860s Alfred's sat up at number of clients across Europe and the United States. In June of 1866 he started the United States blasting Iowa company, the first nitric company in the US. He also spend increasing amounts of time and money protecting his pattern does inventions from fraudsters who tried to make money off his hard work. Alfred was convinced that his invention of dynamite who would ultimately be good for mankind, saying that my dynamite Walt sooner lead to peace then a thousand wells conventions. As soon as men, we'll find that in one instant hole on his can be utterly destroyed. They surely will abide in golden piece as history has borne out his faith in mankind.

Speaker 1:          14:14          It was sadly misplaced in 1869 while traveling in Florence Nobel and that Paul Barb at graduates of the echo polytechnique, Bob who came from an affluent family was fascinated with no bells, dynamite and proposed partnership. He offered to finance the production of dynamite in France and told me that he wanted to learn how to produce it himself. He had no bells interest. Mainly because France was envied in the industry for the state monopoly that had held over explosives production. The two men came to an agreement by which all profits would be split. 50 50 the fringe enterprise was a success and it soon expanded to factories in Spain, Switzerland. Ethnicity. In 18 eight Alfred set his sights on establishing a dynamite company in England's. He considered this to be the prime location as it would open up at the entire British empire as this new market. He spent several months traveling around Britain's mining districts looking for suitable factory locations.

Speaker 1:          15:05          The Best Johns is for investments came from Scotland. After much negotiation, the British dynamite company was formed in 1871 Alfred purchased a four story mansion and to state in Paris. What does the Green House for his prize orchids and stables for his beloved horses, the SDS. It also had a private laboratory for the next decade. Alfred spend the bulk of his time working in this lab along with his assistant. Was George a Fehrenbach? It was here that he discovered what he considered to be dynamite 2.0 Jack Knight. Jack Ignite was not any more stable than dynamite. It calls the greater explosion and was easier to shape overall the substance. It was simply much safer and easier to handle than dynamite. The new invention was and even greater success. The dynamites and Dick caused even more money to flow into the Nobel coffers in 1891 now for the grand dissatisfied with the facilities and as Paris mentioned, the borrower tree, he bought another a stage.

Speaker 1:          15:55          This one located some 15 miles from Paris and the town of sovereign. Yeah, he builds a larger and better equipped to lab. He based himself in the town bus run into problems with the French authorities when he refused to comply with the new regulations and policies which he considered to be unnecessarily restrictive. Amazing. The, the French government charged him with high crimes and treason. He was forced to poses new lab ones. You left for Italy, the French government for bade him from ever working in that country again. Prior to his asked from France. Alfred's had been working on his latest invention Ballis state. He continued this work. It isn't new lab in San Reno in Italy. About that stage was a smokeless propellants that combines nitrocellulose since Nitroglycerin, the rights to the new explosive. What leads to the Italian government. He began using the m one eight nine zero Vasily rifles, which used cartridges that were loaded with Balla state.

Speaker 1:          16:50          Alfred's brother Ludvig died in 1888 the newspapers, however, reported that it was the far more famous Alfred he would pass away. As a result, his Nobel had the rare experience of reading his own obituary. What do you read? It shocked him to his core. Virtually every newspaper that he looked at seemed to glory and his suppose demise. One French headline announced the merchant of death is dead and other reports stated Dr Alfred Nobel, the Musa later who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before died yesterday. Nobel was devastated that the realization that the end result of his life's work was to be worldwide condemnation. He decided that he had to do something to turn around his reputation and whatever time you had left. In 1893 Alfred employed a personal assistant by the name of Ragnar Soleman and appointed him as the executor of his will.

Speaker 1:          17:40          The two men worked diligently on the documents over the next two years. Then on November the 27 1895 Alfred signs the will of the Swedish Club in Paris. It was a well like no other. Alfred left 94% of his total wealth, the equivalent of 265 million, $2,018 to the awarding of a number of annual prizes to individuals who according to the well during the proceeding year, have conferred to the greatest benefit on mankind. The wills spelled out five categories, physics, medicine, chemistry, literature and peace. The peace prize was to be given to the person who has done the most or best work for fraternity between the nations and abolition or reduction of standing armies into the formation and spreading of peace congresses. Today, there is a six category economics, but this was not added until the end of the 20th century

Speaker 1:          18:38          and his late fifties Nobel's health was increasingly causing him problems. His heart was especially weak and it attempts to self medicated. He began administering doses of Nitroglycerin. There's quite likely contributed to his deteriorating state. His body finally gave out on December the 10th 1896 following a stroke. He was 63 years of age. Nobel prizes began to be awarded five years later, the Nobel prize for peace. So today's video is a great example of our science can be used for both good and for bad. And Alfred Nobel is not alone in his position in history as someone who used science to create something truly devastating. But if we cannot understand it, we cannot hope to control it. And when it comes to understanding science, there's really no better place to do that than it brilliance. They all relenting platform, which teaches you through something called active learning. Basically this means that instead of staring at some text and complicated diagrams and equations, you solve problems actively.

Speaker 1:          19:35          I've been using brilliant to get a feel of how this works and it's a bit like this I don't know about sitting down when I was a student looking at a textbook and reading a paragraph and then having no idea what really happens. I'd go back over it again and again and I'm still not really get it or get it a little. What brilliant has absolutely none of that. Each thing you read is immediate. The applied, I chose a random topic and brilliant as an example for this message and in five minutes I understood what vectors, Skylar's and displacement, where in physics it's pretty crazy because if those were just written down in a paragraph like I mentioned before, I'd just be like they were the what now it would make no sense. This is why brilliant is so great. If you like learning and I'm going to guess you all because you're watching a channel like this one, you will love brilliance.
