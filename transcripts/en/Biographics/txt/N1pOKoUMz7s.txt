The family that you joined him, that one was a painfully shy Charles. He kept to himself at school when it's Besson's with Don, he would run home in order to avoid having to talk to any of his peers.

Speaker 1:          01:55          He was also a fearful child who was terrified of many things, but especially the dark. He found his solace in books which were if something, if a constant companion when he was just seven years of age and this was the Hindu costume. Mohan became engaged to Casta muck Hangi [inaudible] who was a few months older than him. The arranged marriage was completed when Mohan turned 13 the planning for the lavish wedding ceremony and adjustment to married life meant that he had to take a year off from his schooling. He was an average student at best, though he tried hard to please as teachers, you have no interest in sports games or social activities with any of his peers. He did, however, make one friends around this time. He wasn't Muslim boy by the name of shake Mahtab Jake was old Zuarin's more street smart than Mohammed. It was also physically larger and stronger than him.

Speaker 1:          02:44          He tried in Mohan about his frail condition and it's holding this. If he ate meat, he would get to much bigger and stronger. No, this was strictly against the Hindu belief, especially. Mohan met his friend in secret one day and he had his first taste of meat even though they caused him to vomit he to eat it for the next year without letting anyone else know. During that period shakes hook into a brothel and experience, which was an embarrassing disaster for the impressionable team. Realizing that shake was a bit of a bad influence. He caught off association with him and returns to a strict vegetarian diet. Bowen's father calm John's died when the boy was 16 years old. The grief was compounded when Bon and Costa was first child died less than a week old. The couple would go on to have four more children with the first being born in 1880 8 million completed college at the age of 18 and enrolled in some Aldous college. However, he disliked the lecture style of teaching and dropped out after only a few months. He had set his sights on becoming a lawyer and eventually becoming a Duwan like his father. A family friends suggested that he should go to England to study where it was easier to pass the bar. It was agreed that this would be the best course of on the Shy Hindu boy was now headed for the bright lights of London

Speaker 1:          04:00          on August the 10th 1880 8 million left his family including his wife and his one month old son [inaudible] and he headed for Bombay where he bought it. A ship that was bound for London. Before leaving though he was something to be the leader of his cost to warns him that if he went to England, he would be tempted to break the rules of Hinduism. He was told to either abandoned his plans, will be excommunicated from the cost. Gandhi accepted this consequence and he continued upon his way. Fitting into Western culture though was that it was a shock to the 18 year olds, everything. It was so different, so what he had known back in India, it's still, he did his best to fit in buying a fine suit, complete with a leather gloves, top hat and Silvertips cane. He also paid for lessons and elocution manners and dumps.

Speaker 1:          04:43          His biggest challenge was with regard to his diet. He had vowed to his mother that he was not going to eat meat, but he was finding it very difficult to find restaurants that cater to vegetarians. His chronic shyness prevented him from requesting alternatives, do what was on offer. That finally though you found a vegetarian restaurants along with a whole community of vegetarians and it was at this point so that he joins the nuns and vegetarian society. Just wait as difficulties with fitting into London in life. Gandhi did well academically. He passed his law exams in June of 1891 his friends at the vegetarian society, they held a celebrator evening and is on it. When it came time to give a speech. However, Mohan was so nervous that he simply rose and Tony said, thank you.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Okay

Speaker 1:          05:30          on is returned to India. Mohan was met at Bombay harbor by his older brother who bought some terrible news, his mother, but Levi had died in his absence moons. Grief was compounded with the consequences of his overseas foray. He was now disfellowshipped from his cost in order to please his family members. He agreed to bathe in a sacred river in order to wash away the sins of England's. This precipitated his reentry into the cost going. Z books for work is a lawyer in Bombay. However, his chronic shyness was still preventing him from making any advancements. He recalls how he fell is presenting his first case before the court saying my head was reeling and it felt as if the whole court was doing likewise. He retreats it to the nes imposing town of Raj Carlton, just stablish to a small law office that shortly thereafter he received an offer from the much and two had been a friend of his father.

Speaker 1:          06:19          This man was now based in South Africa and he needed a lawyer to help with the court case. The year long job was often to Gandhi and he accepted it. Just finished recently becoming a father again. He kept his wife and two young sons under the camera of his brother and he headed off a Durban South Africa in April of 1893 officer settling into his new surroundings, guns. He took the trains, Pretoria where the court case was to be tried. He purchased a first cost ticket. However, on one of the stops the European men bolted, the car that he was in, the men resented seeing an Indian and first costs and left to find the train conductor. The two men returned and has gone. D was wanting to go down to the third class section. God's. He showed them his fitness costs tickets and refuse to move or to that's trained.

Speaker 1:          07:01          Security was cooled and gum dia was kicked off the train. He had to go to the rest of the way in a horse drawn carriage. However, the white passengers of that carriage, they refuse to lessen Indians it inside with them and he was made to sit on the outside foot board. He lays it recalls. The insult was more than I could bat. This was the watershed experience of my hundred Gandhi's life as if by miracle he shook off his timid nature and stepped forward as a leader of the oppressed. When he arrived in Pretoria, he called a meeting of the Indian community and gave the funniest speech of his life cooling for the Indians to stand up for their rights. Once his work on the court case was completed, Gandhi decided to stay and continue to fight the Indian rights. In 1894 he established the natal Indian Congress to give Indians a political voice.

Speaker 1:          07:48          He established himself as a leader in the local community giving free legal advice and offering support. In 1896 off to three years in South Africa. Gandhi, writtens India to connect his family. It returned with his wife and two sons who are now aged nine and five along with a nephew. Gandhi demanded that his family, they dress as Europeans and eat with knives and forks as it was the way with Indians in South Africa. This goal tension within his family. Still two more songs were added to the family and the coming years. When the bow Walbro accounts in 1899 Gandhi fell to this. If the Indian supported the government, they would be rewarded with that or treatments. He organized an Indian ambulance corps who are a valuable asset to the army, but the loyalty, it wins unrewarded with the harsh treatment continuing during this time gone. D develops the life philosophy, which was to going in for the remainder of his days.

Speaker 1:          08:38          They called it [inaudible], which means devotion to the truth. The three core tenants of the belief where noncooperation, nonviolence and non possession. In 1906 the South African province of Transvaal enacted a law that required all Indians to register and be given identity cards. The police were allowed to stop and demand their registration as any time. No other group have this requirement. Guns he advocated the use of saw Takahata counsel the law. He told people not to register. As a result, he ends. Many others were thrown in jail, but Gandhi taught that righteous imprisonments was an honorable thing. The concept of Satyagraha took hold and Gandia established a number of cytochromes settlements. The people in the settlements, they practiced non possession, living a simple and austere life guns. He also organized a large coal miners' strike the men practice noncooperation by refusing to work and nonviolence by refusing to react when they were attacked spinal authorities.

His focus was now on creating harmony between induce and Muslims. For centuries, the two groups had been at loggerheads with one another with Vaughn and clashes often breaking out. Gandhi saw that independence would be impossible without unity and he was determined to bring these two groups together. Gandhi undertook a hunger fast as a tool to bring the Hindus and the Muslims together for three weeks. He only drank water as they're bad people grew weaker by the day. The Hindus and Muslims finally agreed to put aside their differences in order to stop suffering.

Speaker 2:          15:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:15          On march the 12th 1930 guarantee began a month long track from his Ashram and under batch to the seed.

The more the British government, both in India and at home were being pressured by other governments to release Gandhi from jail. Finally the British Viceroy in India. Daughter when met with Gandhi after lengthy discussion, they came to a truce, gone. D would cool off the demonstrations. The prisoners would will be released and Indians would be allowed to make their own salts. In 1931 Gandhi traveled to London to represent the Indian national congress as an international round table conference. He called for Indian independence from Britain.

Speaker 2:          16:44          You can pinned, done that. We run

Newsreels of his visits were shown in movie theaters all around the world.

Speaker 1:          17:11          Surely after returning to India, Gandhi was again arrested for inciting civil disobedience. While he was in prison, the British government passed a law that discriminated against the untouchables and court proceedings. Gonzi was infuriated, doesn't announce that he would not eat until this law was revoked fairing, that his death would create a martyrdom that would doom them in the eyes of the welds. The authorities caved in. The law was rescinded when Britain declared war on Germany. In 1939 Gandhi told the authorities that Indians would only join the war fs if they were promised their independence. Three years later, he started a quit India movement as always, the plans for the campaign to be nonviolent, especially things soon got out of hands and riots broke out across the country. The authorities blamed Gandhians one small, he was thrown in jail. His beloved wife, Christa, was also imprisoned at this time and age.

Speaker 1:          18:00          She soon became ill, dying in custody. On February the 22nd 1944 following his wife's death, Gandhi grew weak with malaria. The authorities agreed to release him then may of 1944 and he went to Bombay to recover and recuperate the end of World War II. Saw great person on its knees though Victoria, since it's spent exorbitant amounts in the war efforts and now no longer have the results, is to maintain its role within India with little choice in the massive person offered India its independence. It was the grand victory that Gandhi had been fighting for for the past 30 years. Even though the nation was now free to rule itself, India was still plagues with deep division between Hindus and most of them's the only solution seemed to be to divide the country up and do Hindu, India and most of them Pakistan. This was a move that was greatly displeasing to Gandhi who loaned the unity between these two groups.

Speaker 1:          18:52          In the weeks following the creation of Pakistan, there were violence clashes between Muslims and Hindus up and down the country. Massek as a could throughout 1947 with both sides being equally responsible for the bloodshed. Hundreds of thousands of people died and there were riots in most of the major cities.

Muslim and Hindu leaders agreed to a piece of court.

Speaker 1:          19:37          However, Gandhi was still very concerned about the direction the fledgling nation was taking. The new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was constantly at odds with his deputy Vallabhbhai Patel and gone. Z counseled both men to make peace. On January the 30th 1948 he was in a meeting with Patel just after 5:00 PM he came out into the gods and a bill, a house in Delhi to offer prowess weakened from his recent Fasti, leans on two of his followers for support as he walks a crowd of some 500 people were waiting to greet him as he made his way to the platform or Hindu extremist Angus Gandhi's leniency towards the Muslims snapped forward. He bowed before the Mahatma and then pulled out a pistol and fired three shots and succession of pointblank range within half an hour. The last breath of life. It seeped out of his body and the great soul with no more.

Speaker 1:          20:26          When he had the news of Mahatmas death, the prime minister stated the light has gone out of our lives and there is darkness everywhere. Hundreds. Gandhi was a light, not just to the people of India, but those of the entire wells.
