Speaker 1:          00:00          Bettie page was arguably the most popular supermodel of the 20th century and she would go down in history as the queen of pet up. Even if you haven't heard of her yet. Once you know who she is, you will begin to see her influence practically everywhere you go. If you live in the United States images and inspired by her still show up in music, videos and movies and pop culture to this very day, even if you recognize her face. Very few people know the story of her real life. This woman never used her circumstances as an excuse for failure and then the amount of grit she needed to overcome obstacles to achieve her dreams is absolutely astounding. This is the inspirational, true story of Betty Page.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Betty Mae. Paige was born on April the 22nd 1923 in Nashville, Tennessee. She was the second of six children and the oldest daughter of royal and a page. Her father was an auto mechanic, but he was also an alcoholic and he had trouble holding down a job. My mother was a housewife and those six kids kept to extremely busy. During the Great Depression, Ryan moved the family around from place to place because he could never keep a job. He was inflicting all forms of abuse on his wife and daughters and he often cheated on Admin as well. When Betsy was 10 years old, her mother finally found the strength to get a divorce. Adding the page now had to work full time even though a few of our kids were still just toddlers and babies. Since she did not have much education, she could only find very low paying jobs.

Speaker 1:          01:36          As the oldest daughter, all of the usual domestic responsibility fell on Betty. She was still only 10 that became the surrogate mother to a younger siblings by cooking, cleaning, and babysitting. She did all of this cheerfully and always had a smile on our face. Indeed, their house became very popular because after school that neighborhood kids could come over to the house and play together without any adult supervision. That's a loved watching movies and they were her escape from her harsh reality. They inspired her to sing and dance. In the back yard on a makeshift stage that the kids made out of discarded scraps of wood. Since this was during the Great Depression, the kids did not have many toys to play with this. They were entertained by Betty's imagination as in as she had an audience who will eagerly await to see what she did next. She was always pushing the envelope and thinking about our next performance, but those dreams they would come to a screeching halt.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Even with Betty's helped. Six children was faulty. Much responsibility for add nuts and manage alone. Even those you worked full time. The amount of money she made was simply not enough. Ryan was not sending her any form of child support and they simply never heard from him again. It got so bad that hadn't have to choose between starvation and giving up some of our children to an orphanage as he, until youngest sister were together in an old girls' home and she encouraged to assist the, to pretends that they were characters in a movie like playing pretend to, to help Toronto and Ptosis to stay strong and resilient through this rather traumatic experience.

Speaker 1:          03:05          After a few years, Betty's mother had saved up enough money and was able to get custody of her children again. That's, he was a few years old now and she had grown into a beautiful young woman, Edna. No was concerned. The Betty might make the same mistake she did and give up her future by marrying the first guy who came along. So she made a rule that Betty was not allowed to have a boyfriends but ours, like most teenagers, Betty rebelled in high school. She fell a Billy Neal, the all star quarterback from the rival high school. He was everything you would imagine of the stereotypical cool kid back then he wore leather jackets. He rode a motorcycle to school and probably skipped class, just smoke cigarettes. But that's just speculation that he fell in love with Billy. But the years spends in the orphanage, they were more than enough for her to know that she never wanted to depend on a man for her financial security as their mother had done.

Speaker 1:          03:55          She wanted to get a college education so that she could always support herself if she needed to. Keep in mind now that in 1940 over 50% of the u s population dropped out of school after the eighth grade, very few women went on to get a high school diploma mirror and even fewer went on to attempt to college degree. If they did. They usually came from well to do families in the upper class, but Betty wasn't going to let family history stopper afterschool, but he joins the debate team and school theatrical productions. She studied extremely hard and graduated second in our class. This allowed her to win a full academic scholarship to Peabody's teacher's college. This was also the moment that she got married to Billy meal, even though she's still dreamed of being a Hollywood starlet. Billy wanted them to have a life together in Nashville.

Speaker 1:          04:38          She loved him so much that she didn't want to break up with him just to pursue her dream. The next best thing was to become a teacher since she would be able to do public speaking and share her knowledge with younger kids. So after getting a bachelor's degree that he started teaching at her old high school, have all my principal and teachers remembered how she excelled in academics because she was still in our early twenties and nos all that far off from the age of our students. She was so beautiful that she became a target of harassment by the young boys. The male students thought that with our perfect hourglass curves, she was simply too distracting to be their teacher. No matter how intelligent she was on the inside, hardly anyone could see past what she looked like on the outside of our know and can take a female teacher seriously unless she looks like professor McGonagall.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Her husband's Billy Neal joins the army and they stationed him at a military base in San Francisco before sending them overseas as his wife, Betty quit her job as a teacher and was very excited about the move to California. She took this opportunity to switch career paths and got a new job as a secretary. One of the men who visited her office said that she was pretty enough to be in the movies and he offered to help her get an audition in Los Angeles. Betty, it was excited hoping that this would be the big break that would make her the movie star that should always dreamed of being that he showed up for a screen test by 20th century Fox, but she hated the experience. She was poked and prodded by the makeup, hair and costume to the point where she didn't even recognize herself. When she looked in the mirror, they told her that if she wanted to make it, she would have to change a lot of things about herself, like going blonde and doing a makeup in a different way.

Speaker 1:          06:08          The man who helped her get the screen test made a move on how promising her fame and fortune in exchange for sleeping with him, but to Betsy turned down his advances. The men Freston to Ruben had reputation and promised that he would make sure that no one ever hot her in Hollywood. Still, she chose to stay faithful to her husband and she walked away. But Betty Paige, she wasn't alone today. We know that the likes of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby made it a habit of preying on young actresses and that this was happening to women for decades before as well. Even though she had been completely faithful to Billy, he was actually angry to come home and find out that she was pursuing our acts in Korea while he was gone. He wanted it to be satisfied with just being a housewife and Dee wanted to move back to Tennessee. She realized that their ambitions in life, they were completely different and they were just simply not compatible any longer and with that they decided to get a divorce.

Speaker 1:          07:04          In 1947 a 24 years old, Bessie moved to New York City and began auditioning for plays and movies and commercials. Unfortunately, she ran into the same problems that she had in Los Angeles and they didn't charge once. It more than just a talent say in exchange for her work and she refused to change a moral compass for three years. She works as a secretary and Manhattan as the is slipped by. She was now considered to be too old to start a career in show business. She had given up everything in order to be an actress and soon enough it would be too late. One day, Betty was walking along the beach on Coney island's when she noticed a man doing pushups on the beach. This was a police officer named Jerry tips. He said that he was a professional photographer on the side and asked if she would be interested in being paid to be a model fam.

Speaker 1:          07:47          After talking to him for a while longer, she decided to say yes when Tibbs last, how old she was. She pretended to be in her early twenties even though by now she was already a 27 year old divorcee. Nowadays, this line about being a photographer who is inviting a young woman into his basement for pictures is used by a surprisingly large number of serial killers and of course perverts, but thankfully for her, the photography sessions went just as Tibbs said they would just, and she was paid handsomely for her time. Many of her photos began showing up and girly magazines around Harlem. Given minds that this was off to world war two were photos of pinup girls has become incredibly popular. A lot of young women at wants it to do their part to help the troops and even after the war posing provocative leaf, a pinup at became a goal of aspiring models.

Speaker 1:          08:32          So Betty Paige was excited to be part of this and she had had such a good experience with Jerry Tibbs. This, he invited dad to become a part of a camera club. In the 1950s Camera Club was where a studio would bring in a group of models. Both amateur and professional photographers would pay a fee to come and take pictures of beautiful women. Sometimes men would show up with a camera that was mts simply because they wanted an excuse to all beautiful women wearing lingerie up close and personal. But Betty Page wasn't just good at modeling. She was a genius. She needed very, this'll direction from the photographers and knew how to strike a pose. Her face was always cheerful, looking friendly and approachable. There was something about her that made men feel that she was the girl next door. Many of the camera men, it's often stop taking pictures of the other girls and spend more time on her because she was just that good at a job.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Soon enough, Betty Paige was raking in money and she made far more than she ever had as a secretary. She saw this as a stepping stone to finally make it into the movies. Now today, it's totally normal for the likes of Victoria secret angels to be on a strict diet and exercise regimen every single day to keep themselves fit, but, but back then, models usually showed up to have photos taken of their natural body. Bettie page, though she didn't rely on a natural beauty to get the job done. She works out every day, watch their diet, and even so new costumes that would look good on camera. She treated it all very much like a business and everything she did during heck area was the new standard for what models would be expected to do in the future. She began receiving requests to do photo shoots all over New York City, and eventually she became a million app.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Whenever it tastes changed, photography is expected Bettie page to do things that were more and more risk a, she would agree to do it despite any previous hesitations that she had in the past. She knew that times were changing and if she wanted to keep her career in business going, she would have to begin posing in the nude. If you think of willingness to pose nude sounds sort of contradictory when you consider the fact that she refused to sleep with anyone to get the job. She had this to say being in the nude isn't a disgrace unless you're being promiscuous about is often roll. When God created Adam and Eve, they were stark naked and in the gods into these and God was probably naked as a Jay bird too. So if she continued to pose naked so long as she thought that it was at least tasteful, one day the camera club decided to find a secluded area in upstate New York to have a nude photo shoot outside where the models were frolicking in the grass and it shouldn't be a surprise to you that the police showed up and arrested.

Speaker 1:          10:56          The women and the photographers. They challenged the men with disturbing the peace and the women with indecent exposure that he actually yelled at the police officers saying that she refused to accept that charge because she was not an indecent person. She demanded to have the same challenge as the men and they finally gave in and changing it to disturbing the peace despite having to serve time in jail for her nude photos. She still continued to do these photo shoots anyway. During the peak of our popularity. Bettie page became Ms January in 1955 in playboy magazine who half no one said that he slept with 11 out of 12 of the cover models of each playboy issue in Betty Page would have been not one exception who didn't have to sleep with him in exchange for being published. They actually purchased a nude photos from a female photographer and fellow model named Bunny Yeager have not respected page immensely saying that she was a remarkable lady and iconic figure in pop culture who influenced sexuality tastes in fashion. Someone who had a tremendous impact on our society. When the issue of playboy came out, we can only imagine how her former high school students, Mr Fellows, when they opened up the pages of playboy ends, figured out that the teacher they once had a crush on has now done a full spread of nudes in glossy prints. For some, that was probably a dream come true.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Modeling was paying the bills, but Betty Page still wanted to move in the direction of being in the movies. Sibling business partners, Paula and Irving core ran the movie star new store where they sold beauty photography of pinup models. They also film short clips of Betty dancing in lingerie and sold them to customers. She eventually started in two movies called Stripper Rama and varieties after work. Betty was taking acting classes and auditioning for plays on Broadway, but without much luck. In 1955 percenters are named as of Alpha, created a subcommittee that was cracking down on comic books, pornography, and it's basically anything else that could be considered sinful. The FBI detained Betty Page and interrogated her, asking if Irving and Paula claw web shooting pornographic movies at the movie star new store. Betty pretested saying that the women were never fully nude in these movies and there were never any men in them either.

Speaker 1:          13:03          Betty's boss seven claw was taken the course before the Senate subcommittee, even though he was found not guilty. The mere suggestion that she was starring in porn ruined about his reputation, her name, it was printed in newspapers all over New York City. Bettie page became the target of slut shaming and men were yelling at her in the streets. A store could began to center letters threatening to kill her. Since she had gotten to know the FBI agents in New York City, she contacted them right away. They believe that the person who send the letters was a known serial killer. They set up a plan where they used Betty is bait to catch the murder. Rand's only jumped in at the last minute to save her. It turns out that the stalker was only a 16 year old boy, but all of this took a serious toll on Betty's mental health and it was all downhill from that.

Speaker 1:          13:46          In 1957 the savings have to shut down the movie star new store and Betty Paige was out of a job. She decided to stop working as a model and give up her dream of becoming an actress. She moved to Florida and became a born again Christian. The church made her feel like she was a sinner and that she needed to repent. While in Florida. She began to attend Bible College and trying to become a Christian missionary overseas. In the 1960s however, only found out that she was a divorcee. They reject it to us saying that she was to indecent is to represent the church. She began taking graduate courses to Anna Masters degree in the hopes that maybe she grew back to being a teacher, but our reputation. It followed her there too and she dropped out. All along, her mental state continued to decline and by the 1970s she was beginning to suffer from schizophrenia.

Speaker 1:          14:27          She had a nervous breakdown and ended up in a mental hospital. After receiving psychiatric treatment for several years, she was released. During that time, she had to be essentially d programs because the church should brainwashed her into hating herself and all of our accomplishments. As time went on, there was a revival in interest of a Betty Page. She had been one of the most photographed models of the 20th century, and when she retired, she seemingly disappeared. Explanation. People wanted to know what had happened to her and the mystery. It only added to the excitement for 40 years. No one had heard anything about life. After modeling. In 1998, Playboy magazine tracked her down and asked for an interview. They asked, uh, if she ever felt ashamed of her work while she was doing, or if those feelings of guilt came after she started receiving criticism. She said, I never thought it was shameful. I felt normal. It's just that it was much better than pounding a typewriter eight hours a day, which gets monotonous, or the rest of her life fans and Betty Page letters telling her how much they loved and appreciated our bravery for paving the way for so many other women. And she finally got the recognition and love that she deserved. She died of a heart attack in 2008 at 85 years old. At the time of her death, she had a net worth of $20 million

Speaker 1:          15:46          even though it was considered to be very scandalous at the time. That sort of modeling Betty Paige did is on par with Victoria secrets and the Calvin Klein ads of today near New Jersey has become such a big part of American culture that some young women even but similar photos of themselves on Instagram without a second thought today, we'd barely baton eyelid. That those images of Betty Page that were deemed to be so sinful and inappropriate, one thing is for certain though without are things wouldn't be the same. Bettie page is iconic. Look also became the inspiration for a number of fictional characters, including Jenny Blake from a comic book called the rocket [inaudible]. She also inspired the looks of celebrities like Katy Perry, Madonna, and the modern day burlesque dancer, Dita von Teese. In modern times, most men have moved on to having crushes on other females. Celebrities and the photos of Betty Page may not seem like anything special today.

Speaker 1:          16:36          She is actually now more popular with women, especially feminists. She was strong, smart, independent, and never backed down on what she believed was right. Even if it took her years of heartache and struggle, she was able to make it in the modeling industry on her own terms. Even after a death or estate continues to make tons of money in 2017 oh then Betty Page merchandise sold for $7 million. Her memory will continue to live on as one of the most iconic women in all of history. So I already have you found that video. Interesting. If you did, please do give us a thumbs up below.
