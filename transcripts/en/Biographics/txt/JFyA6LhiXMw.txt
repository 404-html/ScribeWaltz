You can check the mouths of INSERRA watches.com forward slash biographics there's also a link below his writings inspired the great revolutionary movements of the 20th century leading to the dictatorial rise of men like Joseph Stalin and Mouser Dong. He lived a life of poverty and obscurity. Contends let others take the limelight and aware that his ideas would not be realized during his lifetime. We remember him as the father of communism, yet the version that took hold in the Soviet Union and China or little resemblance to what he had envisioned. In this week's biographics, we discovered the man who was Karl Marx.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Comox was born on May the fifth 1818 and the historic German town of Tria. His was an upper middle class family with his father, Heinrich are doing well as a lawyer cause mother Henrietta was from a wealthy Dutch family. The family was Jewish, but Heinrich had converted to Christianity the year before Cole was born in order to avoid the harsh laws that were being imposed upon Jews. Cole was the third of nine children. He became the eldest son when his brother Bart's died in 1919 the young call was a lively child who was prone to getting into trouble. He was homeschooled by his father to the age of 12 at which point he entered the tree. Our high school, the headmaster of the school, Hugo Whitson Bark, took an instant liking to the inquisitive young Marx and helped him to mold his early philosophical ideas, which mark taught liberal ideas to a students and employed a young liberal humanists as teachers. As a result, the school develops a reputation as a fermenter of dangerous ideologies. In 1832 where's embark was placed under surveillance by the authorities with the school being searched for subversive materials.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Call graduated from the school at the age of 17 he furthered his studies at Bond University and rolling as law students in October of 1835 he found the workload during his first semester to be extremely challenging by the beginning of 1836 years. Originalist his attendance to a part time level. He spent most nights at local pubs in often woke the next day with a hangover limiting the amount of focus that he could give to his studies. On one occasion he was actually arrested for public intoxication. After a year of wasting his efforts at the University of Bonn marks his father, he put his foot down. He transferred his wayward son to the University of Berlin and ordered him to start getting serious about his education. The summer before he transferred to Berlin University, cold returned home to triad. He began to romance with a young woman called Jenny Vaughn. West fallen who he had known since childhood before leaving for university in October called proposed and the two were engaged.

Speaker 1:          02:51          The move to Berlin University has served the purpose of encouraging marks to get serious about his studies. He replaced late night carousing with membership and the of philosophical societies. He became interested in the ideas of German philosopher, Gwf Heagle and the idea is that he Moldova Sora expression in a number of essays and treatises that he began working on calls Brian Academic Star. It was diminished in May of 1838 with the death of his father. He had a great deal of respect and love. The Heinrich ans was shattered by his loss. His father had been supporting him financially and the sudden loss of this support imposed a financial hardship on him. This was a great consent and the West fallen so when now convinced that call would not be able to support their daughter as his bright, but the young couple, they continued that courtship even though they were far away from each other.

Speaker 2:          03:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Following his father's death mocks shifted the focus of his studies from law to philosophy. His goal was to graduate with honors and then secure a position at the university as a philosophy lecturer in order to help fund his studies. He sought work as a journalist. He secured a position with the most controversial newspaper in the region, the Rhineland News, the paper expressed vocal opposition to the Prussian occupation of the Ryman. In October of 1842 Karl Marx became the editor in chief of the paper. It was through this paper. The marks began writing about communism and what form of possible communist government could take, but when he openly criticized the Russian monarchs on Nicholas, the first there was a step too far. The brushing authorities moved in and they shut down. The paper box was now an unemployed journalists, but that didn't stop him and Jenny marrying on June the 19th 18 at 43 does ceremony took place in a Protestant church and was attended by members of both families though many of the West filing plan mustards, there's Jenny was marrying below her station. However, the marriage it was to last the couple until they were potted by death.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Colin, Jenny, they moved in with Jenny's mother. They lived off the mother's step and does color. Tried to restart his writing career. He managed to get a writing gig writing for a newspaper called the Deutsche Franz Usha Yaba heard that had as its audience far leftists in the Rhineland. The paper that had been started by German Socialist Arnold Ruiz, who was based in Paris in October of 1843 marks his wife, they moved to Paris and bordered with region. His wife. In 1844 Jenny gave birth to their first Charles. There's made the living conditions extremely crammed and so the marketers, they moved into their own apartments as well as publishing. The newspaper marks and rouge worked together on two treatises that would become very controversial. The seconds of them was called on the Jewish question evenly. Marx was of Jewish ancestry himself. The pamphlet comes across as quite antisemitic in as he wrote for the first time if the proletariat, so working class bands of revolutionaries who would throw off the yoke of religion and other cultural bonds to finally unite the masses.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Soon after Mark's moved on from working with rouge defined employments with the Paris based newspaper, four watts or forward, which targeted Germans living in France that ava was sponsored by the League of the just made up of German immigrants who believed in a communist system where everyone enjoyed economic equality. It was while working for Volvo, it's that Mark's maps since forms an alliance with Friedrich Engels, the two men. They immediately jelled with their ideas converging into what would be cool to classical Marxism. Marx was inspired by a report that angles had written goals, the conditions of the working class in England. He was convinced more than ever that the working class, which eventually rise up and overthrow their oppressors angles, came from a wealthy family and over the years he would prop up Mark's financially time and time again. They're revolutionary ideas that mocks was espousing through his writing. Soon came to the attention of the Prussian authorities who put pressure on him to be France. The interior ministry, it's shut down votes and mocks was given 24 hours to leave the country. He decided to relocate to Brussels, Belgium with his wife and baby joining him a few days later.

Speaker 1:          06:55          Belgium was a liberal and free thinking country and so it was a natural fit for the leftest philosophies of called mocks, so you don't have to assess. I think in Brussels, Jenny became pregnant with the couple's second child back in Germany. Marks in mother-in-law became concerned that her daughter wouldn't be able to cope with the stress of starting a new with one small child and another one on the way she sends them. Made Seven Helen de Muth to Russell's to help her cope. Helen would from then on be a permanent member of the marks households and known to Marx. The Prussian government was putting pressure on the Belgians to kick him out. As a result, he experienced frustrating delays in his efforts to obtain permanent residency in order to get residency grounds that he had to promise not to get involved in local political issues or a spouse's pendant school views.

Speaker 1:          07:38          He then proceeded to find loopholes that would allow him to spread his ideas. In 1847 he published a treatise entitled the poverty of Philosophy, which challenged in early attract by French leftist Piaget CF Pruett Hall cooled the philosophy of poverty. The poverty of philosophy was a stepping stone towards Marx's most impressive and famous work, the communist manifesto. In order to get direct experience of the conditions of the working class, he traveled to England in 1845 along with Friedrich Engels. They taught factories and slums witnessing the terrible working conditions and the even worse living conditions. After six weeks in England's marks returns Brussels fully equipped to produce his magnum opus. Two weeks later, the 30 page pamphlet, it was ready for the presses. The communist manifesto was published on February the 21st 1848 in it's mock stated that the boards want to see where their own grave diggers with they're exploited workers, rising ops, whoever, throw them.

Speaker 1:          08:36          Soon after the manifestos publication, the second French revolt broke out. The Monica was cast aside in the democratic government was put in place back in Belgium. Mark's was arrested for sub lessee of activity. Upon his release, he made the decision to head to a reinvigorated and Frea France. The modern families relocation was helped by the belated that he received from his father's estate. Most of that money though, was poured into starting another newspaper. This newspaper was called the Noya Reinsch Zeitung angles worked on the paper providing the latest news and happenings from Europe so you don't have to. Moving to France marks joins the communist league, which had been formed by members of the Jak among club after the revolution in order to prevent the aristocracy from reasserting itself. That methods of doing so well, so drastic that the time period it became known as the reign of terror.

Speaker 1:          09:22          The French authorities viewed the Communist League as the re-instituted Jacobin Club of just under a new name. This brought official scrutiny upon the league. With Mark's being arrested several times. Initially the police were unable to direct city Lincoln to any subversive activity and no prosecution was brought against him, but things changed when the Prussian King Frederick William the fourth took a personal interest in stomping out every leftist movement in Israel. It didn't take long phase attention to go to the Paris based leftist newspaper run by call marks for the second time in his life. He was expelled from France. Logs had pulled all of his financial results is into the paper with it shut down. He was left with nothing. He only has enough money to get out of France, had to visit a porn shop and Hawk his family's silver. He received support from a couple of German socialists to raise money to help get marks reestablished.

Speaker 1:          10:11          However, the help center down to be a double edge sword, the benefactors of painted marks to be in such a poor demoralized condition in order to scale support that color was treated as a laughingstock when he returned. Mark's was not pleased with this reception. He stated that the greatest financial difficulties are preferable to public begging. Now, just before we get into monks is moved to London in his later life. I want to tell you a bit about today's sponsor and that's been Sarah watchers. I'm wearing of INSERRA watch right now.

Let's get back to Mark's

Speaker 1:          11:55          in June of 1849 the Mars family or fought? Relocated. Yes. Again, the destination. This time it was London, England. It was that final move with a famous German spending the rest of his life amongst the English. Not long after the marks is settled in London, the disbanded French Communist league reformed in the city, the leaders of the movements wanting to bring about an immediate revolt of the working classes in London, which would ideally then spread it across the entire continent box viewed these goals as unrealistic and labeled the leaders of the communist league as unrealistic dreamers. He was firmly convinced that the overthrow would come, but believed that it had to evolve gradually. He wasn't even concerned if the revolution didn't come in his own lifetime. He was happy to plant the seeds but would come to fruition at a later time. As it turned out, the first communist revolution that didn't happen for another 68 years in London, Mark's focused on bringing reforms on a smaller scale.

Speaker 1:          12:46          He champions the rights of the poor and advocated for voting rights and freedom of speech. For the first few months in London, the marks family were among the poor of London only surviving thanks to the financial support provided by Friedrich Engels, the financial strain. It was lifted in 1851 when mark secured a position as a European correspondent. For the New York Daily Tribune at the stoss and goals had to translate the articles that Marx wrote before. Long call taught himself English and was able to translate for himself. At the time, the New York Daily Tribune was the most widely read newspaper and all of the United States. The paper paid him 200 pounds per year in order to provide two articles per week. Still, it was never quite enough and the family struggled to make ends meet. In 1852 marks was concerned with what was taking place across the English Channel.

Speaker 1:          13:28          The second French Revolution had erupted and a new Napoleon, the nephew of the first seized power establishing itself as the new emperor longs was frustrated at how the French working people goods allow another dictator to rule over them. He wrote a book, calls the 18th Broomer of Louis Napoleon, which mocks the new emperor in as he placed the blame on both the French working class of being sucked in by the dictator and on the proletariats being gullible to Napoleon's promise to keep the masses in check and his book, he summed it up this way. The struggle seems to be settled in central way that all classes equally impotence and equally remote fall on their knees before the rifle butts.

Speaker 1:          14:10          As a correspondent for the New York Daily Tribune, Marx was in a unique position to give an outside perspective on the American civil war. He predicted that the election of Abraham Lincoln would lead to civil war, that the war would greatly impacts the British economy with its textile industry. Relying on exports of cotton from the American south. He was right on both counts with the slowdown in trade being at times the cost and the famine. Many British factory workers lost their jobs providing the British government. We have the incentive to provide financial aid to prop up the confederate cause Mark's was quick to point out the hypocrisy in Britain's position. Having outlawed slavery itself. Person was now supporting the slave owning southern states in order to boost our own economy. Is articles published in the Tribune without the, until the paper changed its pro abolitionist stance and again, calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities from now on, articles tend to be neutral in that tone.

Speaker 1:          15:01          This was a disaster from mark, so you run willing to compromise his principles, tendered his resignation once more. Karl Marx was unemployed. It was terrible timing with financial pressures having mounds it even before his leaving the paper. On top of that, Jenny was sick with about of a small box with nowhere else to turn. Box sought relief from Friedrich Engels. However, Bengals was grieving the recent death of his wife and that has it from cholera. Requesting relief was not taken kindly. After three days of stewing on the matter, he sent the following reply, you will find it natural. That's my own trouble and your frosty reception of it made it positively impossible for [inaudible] all my friends, if Shane me on this occasion, which was bound to touch me very nearly more sympathy and friendship than I could expect. You found the moment suitable to enforce the superiority of your cold thought processes.

Speaker 1:          15:49          Mark's was surprised and upset that he had unwittingly insulted angles. He quickly wrote back and the process giving us insight into just how desperate to situation was wrote. My wife and children will bend the witness that when you'll let it came. I was much shattered by the death is one of those nearest to me, but when I wrote to you in the evening, which was under the impression of very desperate conditions, I had the landlord's broker in the house, the butcher protesting my cheque shortage of coals and foods and there's little Jenny in bed in such second senses. I can generally save myself only by cynicism.

Speaker 1:          16:29          The two men quickly made up and then goes once more provided financial support to keep the marks family afloat. Before long. However, Mark's faced a new crisis while his wife's health improved has earned again to deteriorate. Suppose the rubs it all over his body. You causing great pain and discomfort he suffered on as he completed his latest work does capital. The work was published in Berlin in 1867 and it's, he emphasized the surplus value of Labor into the impact of that machines would have on the workforce. Does capital was a success, but that didn't translate to financial stability for the ever a struggling family walks. His mother once made the saint and comments if only Carl had made capital instead of just writing about it. When Mark's, his daughter Laura got engaged to a struggling medical students named Paul the fog. Have protective father sought to save her from the same mistake her mother had made marrying a man who was ill prepared to Katha hot.

Speaker 1:          17:18          He strongly objected to the marriage only relenting when he gains the assurance that the young man was able to care for his daughter financially. By 1869 marks was actively working as an ambassador for an organization called international working man's association, which endeavored to bring the world of communism together under a single umbrella. In 1870 France declared war on Germany among the international working men's association that was a division between those who are in favor of the war and those who were against it. Mark's was keying for Germany to give the Frederick good drubbing believing that it would lead to the resurgence of socialism in France following the defeat of Napoleon. The third a coalition of international workers, members and French citizens combined state control of Paris. After two months, they were overthrown by the French authorities. In our short period of time, mark saw the embodiments of his proletarian revolt. It's overthrown by the establishment, convinced him that the working class cannot simply lay hold of ready made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes for a takeover of power to be successful marks reasons there had to be an existing infrastructure ready to replace the old one.

Speaker 1:          18:27          For the last decade of his life, Comark struggled with health problems and financial survival. During this period. He produced just one work of note in which he commented on what he terms the dictatorship of the proletariat. He expressed his firm belief that the mass is needed to work together in the coming revolution without allowing for a dominant leader to rise. Unfortunately, that is precisely what happens in many of the Communist revolutions of the 20th century. On December the second 1891 Carl's lifelong companion Jenny died. She had been in terrible pain with cancer of the liver for months. Her last words to call or good indicating that she was happy that her pain was it an end following Jenny's death marks fell into a deep depression at the prompting of his lifelong friend and Friedrich Engels. He took a holiday to Algiers. After two months, he returned to England just as he was beginning to get back on his feet.

Speaker 1:          19:15          He received another blow when his daughter Jenny Caroline died of bladder cancer at the age of 38 with the loss of his to Jenny's Marx gave up the will to live. He hung on for another two months racked by pain and living in poverty. The end game on March the 14th 1883 when his bodies to come and to do a combination of bronchitis and pleurisy. The man was gone, but his ideas continues and they had a massive impact on the coming century. So I already hope you found this video. Interesting.
