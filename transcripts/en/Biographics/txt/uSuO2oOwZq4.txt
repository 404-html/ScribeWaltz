Speaker 1:          00:00          He was the father of fascism, the iron fisted dictator who ruled Italy for more than two decades. During that time, he punched his country into disaster forming an alliance with adult Hitler and is bringing the wrath of the wells and his own people upon him. In the end, his own citizens express their own roofless verdict on the man who called himself. He'll do chain and this week's biographics. We track the life and the death of Benito Mussolini.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Benito, I'll mill, could I and dre. And Mussolini was born on the 29th of July, 1883 and a small village near the northern Italian town of pet. Happy Yo in the province of folly. His father and rather Sandra was a blacksmith and an atheist who was heavily involved in socialist politics while his mother Rosa was a devout Roman Catholic school teacher with his parents divergent beliefs. The young Mr Linny was raised to put his faith in both Karl Marx and the pope. His mother took him to mass several times a week while his father dragged him to the pub to learn from his socialist friends from the start. Benito proved to be an aggressive and rebellious child and later life he recalled I was not a good boy. I was, I believe on really by the time he was eight Mussolini was spending long hours helping us father in the furnace.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Here he would listen to Alessandra is socialist ideas and these words are mold his future philosophy, but the wise heart was with his mother. He feared displeasing, Huh? Yes. This did not curb his way with tendencies. By the time he was nine Raisa had become so exasperated with Benito that she sends him to a school run by Roman Catholic monks in order to instill some much needed discipline. The defines Benito Chafed at the strict discipline and his behavior became even worse. He got into a number of fights and was eventually expelled when he took on one of the monks, Rosa, no center wayward son to a less strict school closer to home. This though it did nothing to improve his behavior and his before long he was expelled. This time for threatening and other students with a knife has exasperated mother nine inch to find a third school where he managed to see artists schooling or the age of 17 Benito completed his 10 years of compulsory schooling.

Speaker 1:          02:14          His main accomplishments over that time web, not really academic. Rather he learned how to play the trombone and speak in public. However, despite his poor academic record in 1901 he qualified as a school teacher, but he seemed discovered that teaching did not suit him. He was far more interested in the two passions that he had inherited from his father, socialism and womanizing. The 18 year olds. Benito was a strong, handsome man with a forceful personality and a certain charisma. He easily drew the attention of young women, often the wives of other men. There's often resulted in him having fistfights with people's husbands,

Speaker 1:          02:53          often less than a year muscly, and he had lost his teaching job after getting into a violence arguments with no money and it's very visceral prospects. He moved to Switzerland. He worked in eight succession of manual jobs to support himself within a short time he had attached himself to a group of Marxists. He also joined a trade union. Nan's began attending rival political rallies where he would hack all the sneaker and start fights with those in the crowd. As a result of these political agitations, Benito was arrested and deported back to Italy several times, but each time he returned to Switzerland's more determined than ever to keep Stuttering v political pot. [inaudible] struggle to make ends meet and Switzerland. On one occasion he accosted two elderly women on the street and stole food for them. In his 1928 auto biography. He related that if the women had struggles, he would have strangled them. In 1904 he returned to it to the end, he joins the Italian army he served out has compulsory 18 months, 10 months into his military service. Miscellaneous beloved mother Rosa. She died a distraught of Benito laser called this the greatest sorrow of his life. He was discharged from the army in September of 1906 he had clearly not learned discipline while in this country service as his life now revolved around drinking, womanizing and fighting,

Speaker 1:          04:09          he managed to gain employment as a teacher again with a succession of temporary contracts. During this period prior to the first world war, listening to his moral character deteriorated as socialists socialist ardor increased. He wrote four and edited several Socialists newspapers running against the government, the democratic system, the middle classes, and the church and one pamphlets incisal to God. It does not exist. He rose to the priests were black microbes who are as faithful to mankind as tuberculosis germs when it's entered in a war against Libya. In 1911 Mysoline he led the internal criticism against the government's actions through his newspaper writings. He's outspoken. Opposition led to his arrest and it's a five month imprisonment. Yes, his fist shaking public opposition to the government. I'd also gone to the attention of the country's top socialist leaders who looked on admiringly. The young Benito Mussolini was viewed by them as a rising star of the left in December of 1912 shortly after his release from prison, but he's was appointed editor of the country's national socialist newspaper goals, Avanti. It was a natural fit and within six months is firebrand style of journalism. I had increased the papers readership five fold now have a national forum with which to air is for use.

Speaker 1:          05:25          When war broke house in 1914 Mr Leni held firm non-interventionist views. He saw war as anti-socialist does it pitted the working classes of one nation against those of another. Within months he had changed his view. He now saw war is an opportunity for revolution. He now used his voice through the pages of Avante to call on the young men of Italy to join the army. What's the name is about face on the war situation, put him at odds with more moderate socialists leaders and resulted in his expulsion from the party and it's the loss of, is that a ship of the paper? Defiantly he started his own newspaper, ill popular Italia or the people of vessels. This paper ran continuously from November, 1914 it's almost Selenis removal from power. 29 years later in his first editorial, he proclaimed the famous line blood alone moves the wheels of history.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Around this same time, Mr Leni founded his first political party, the FASC over revolutionary action. This was soon simply known as the fascist party, the main allied powers, Britain and France supported Mussolini, seeing him as a key to getting Italy more involved in the war effort. They provided much needed financial support to the new party. The British secret service, even paid muscly need a wage of 100 pounds per week. In July of 1915 is at least signs the treaty of London committing itself to fighting alongside the allies against Germany. But it isn't. These war soon became a fiasco. It was plagued by poorly trained and experienced officers and unwilling belligerent conscripts. They became bogged down and a battle of attrition against Austria, Hungary. By the time it was all over, more than 650,000 Italians would add half a million we're missing and nearly a million. Where we ended was Eleni himself. [inaudible] joined the army in September of 1915 he attained the rank of corporal winning a claim for his bravery and devotion to his men. On February the 20 seconds 1917 he was in a trench when one of his fellow soldiers grenades exploded. He was badly wounded requiring numerous operations over the course of the next month, and then he was sent home to recuperate, was the, his message now morphed from socialism and the plate of the working man to patriotism as the cause of ultra nationalism.

Speaker 2:          07:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:37          During the postwar talks in Paris, Italy, it was treated dismissively by the major powers, the territories that she had been promised to during the 1915 treaty of London when not handed over the Italian prime minister, Vittoria Orlando walked out of the conference in total disgust. Orlando bore the brunt of the public discontent and we're soon removed from office and the following elections, miscellaneous fascist party failed to win a single seat. His political rivals made fun of this staging and mock funeral for the party chief among his adversaries, where the Socialists Seward won a third of the seats in parliament and ticking. Most Illini was now firmly opposed to over the next three years. The political situation and instantly was extremely unstable with four prime ministers and coalition governments. None of these was able to yield any real power. The country. It was in a state of near anarchy with the rampant inflation and unemployment is driving people to total despair.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Mussolini's Fascist, stressed, and they're intimidating black shirts rooms through the streets, seeking out and beating up socialists, communists or anyone who they didn't like the look of the police who have sympathy for the fascists usually stood by and let muscle in his mat and get away with it. On May the 15th of 1921 national elections were held this time the fascists join day coalition of rightwing parties, the national block, and as the one that 35 seats out of the total of 535 in the house of parliament. Mussolini himself gained a seat and the Chamber of Deputies, he was now an official member of the Italian government realizing that he now needed to broaden his base. Most of the knee did an about face on a couple of is underpinning principles. He became both pro Monica pro church, but his hatred of socialism. That certainly remains. Mussolini renames the potty now calling it the national fascist party is reputation began to grow and he became known as a man with the ability to rule with a firm hands and restore order amidst the chaos that Italy had fallen into, public opinion was actually beginning to turn in his favor.

Speaker 1:          09:34          That popularity was bolstered when Mussolini's black shirts broke up his socialist back strike in October of 1922 at a rally. Shortly thereafter, Mosley need declared in the speech that either the government would hand over power to him or he would seize it for himself, and this was no idle bluster with no sign of capitulation by the government. Mussolini decided to stage a coup by marching on Rome. His forces, though they were no match for the Italian army, but still the prime minister, Luigi factor offered Mussolini a position in his government in order to avoid conflict. The offer was roundly rejected and the fascists marched on the capital. The panics. Prime Minister urged the king to allow him to use the army to quash the rebellion. The king agreed. He quickly changed his mind fairing that a civil war with breakouts, there's enraged the prime minister who ultimately resigned from his office.

Speaker 1:          10:21          The 28,000 fascists marching on the Capitol stops 20 miles north of the city. That half of them left to often written time. The rest carries on with Mussolini himself joining them at various points to have his photo taken at the front of the line. But with the rain pouring down, he was content to leave the heavy marching to others. And took an express train and Rome, the king who secretly admired Mussolini now tried to play Katen by offering him a governmental role. Mussolini, though he would consider nothing but the prime ministership. Eventually the king offered him the position. By Age 39 muscle Ini had become prime minister, not through violence revolution, but through threat bluster and unequivocal demands in the wake of his victory. Ecstatic fascists rooms the streets in search of downhearted socialists that they could terrorize. Mm.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Mussolini was now both Prime Minister and foreign minister, but his government was very much a majority in the house of parliament. This forced him to work within the confines of democracy, which left and at the mercy you if the majority coalition this though it was not a situation that the power hungry autocratic would tolerate for very long. Within eight weeks of assuming office muscle lenient forms of the fascist grand council, the grand council acted as a conduit between the fascists and the Chamber of deputies filled with his hand, picked appointees. It was in effect, a mouthpiece for most Illini, which effectively lessens the power of parliament to act. In 1923 the grand council passed a law that rigged the electoral system to ensure that the fascists gains a sizable majority in the next election. When the election was held the following April, the fascists won 374 of the 535 seats.

Speaker 1:          12:02          This new law had certainly helps them gain the 70% majority, but sue did the vigilance presence of miscellaneous black chefs who co asked the public to vote for the fascists. In addition, opposition party meetings, we're broken up and the candidates were beaten. In the wake of this overwhelming electoral victory. Socialists leader Jack Mo matter Yachty openly it denounced the fascists and their leader. 11 days later, Matty Yachty was assassinated. This led to nationwide protests against most lenient is party of thugs with many people are calling on the king to depose the Prime Minister Fears Boston. What's Illini plaid innocence and acted shocked and revolted by the murder. He did his best to to distance himself from the crime. Still politicians from all parties responded by withdrawing from parliaments in an effort to force miscellaneous ejection from office, but the king refuse to get rid of most of the knee and a vote of confidence. On January the third 1925 a few of the prime minister's opponents showed up after the opportunists team now took the opportunity to cement his absolute authority. He declared that only the fascists could provide stability in the country and it would be achieved through dictatorship.

Speaker 1:          13:11          That's the most Selenis propaganda machine infiltrated every area of Italy. A cult of personality develops around him. People consider them to be a genius man of action, but one with a common touch. When things went well, it was all thanks to all [inaudible] the leader. However it when things went wrong, it was never his fault. He was a mesmerizing speaker. He used facial expressions and gestures. Do you capture and then throw all his audience. He stood at only at five foot six inches and likes to dress and striped trousers and shirts with butterfly colors. He was not a well man, physically suffering from ulcers and stomach upsets. His health problems forced him to give up smoking and drinking. I'm beginning to lose his hair. In his late twenties he took just shaving his hat. He was also short sighted to vent wear glasses. What's the Leni spend the next two years dismantling democracy and so they understand wishing his own totalitarian regime.

Speaker 1:          13:59          During that time, he instilled three key messages into the public consciousness, believe, obey and fight. This message gained widespread approval. Even many former socialists now turn to fascism the farm hands of the state. We're seen as the only solution to the country's woes. All forms of criticism of the state where bands and opposition parties were disbanded was Leni himself, was answerable only to the king. Spies were everywhere and he gets a report to the authorities. Anyone who spoke or acted against the state during the 1920 is the fascists have made modest improvements in the Italian economy. However, all of this was over turns with the global depression that followed the Wall Street crash in October of 1929 once again, the country went into a state of economic chaos. What's the lenient responded by embarking on foreign invasions during the 1930s he's sent armies into Libya, Ethiopia and Spain. Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. Yeah. Began in 1935 and resulted in a devastating occupation that would continue until 1941 when the British army forced the Italians out. During that time, it has been estimated that 8% of Ethiopia's population was put to death. Mussolini. You ordered that the male populations of entire towns, the wipes out if EOP is leader Haile Selassie was forced to flee to England's where he petitions the United Nations. This infuriated by selenium and sent him into the arms of a neighboring dictator by the name of adult Ed Blah.

Speaker 1:          15:29          On May the 20 seconds, 1939 Hitler and Mussolini signed a Pact of steel. This man's that they promised to come to each other's aid in the event of walk. Less than four months later up Germany invaded Poland igniting world war to whistler. Leni approved erratic in its response to the prospect of fighting a European war alongside the Nazis. On the very day that Germany invaded, Poland is Mysoline. He announced to his cabinets because he had decided not to fulfill his obligation from the pact of steel on the basis that Germany has signed a nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union and act that violated the providers of the pact. The truth was that muscle meaning you had absolutely no confidence and it's country's readiness for war, despite his announcement to his cabinet, most of them, and you continue to put up a pretense of support for headlamp. However, in private, he spoke of joining the British and French coalition.

Speaker 1:          16:16          Finally on June the 10th, 1940 with the Nazi's looking, I should have an easy victory over the French Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, Italian troops where I quickly sent to France in order that Mr he could have some share in the spoils of victory. At the same time, he mobilized forces into Africa to attack British Holdings. That large scale forces were sent into Egypt while other divisions focused on Greece. At the same time, Mr meaning it was overseeing the air force as they joins with the Nazi Luftwaffe. Uh, in the battle of Britain in every theater, the ill prepared Italian forces were driven back or stalemated this enraged at la who was forced to send German troops in to save the Italians. By the beginning of 1942, it was a Paris, Italy was fighting a losing war. They were badly beaten in Egypt at the battle of Al Amin, and the allied invasion of French north Africa pushed them further back on their heels. The allied invasion of Sicily was the final Straw is, are these complete to feet? It was only a matter of time.

Speaker 1:          17:16          The country was in a state of emergency if there was no fuel. So all the factories were not working for you. It was incredibly scas with widespread starvation resulting. The people were desperate and they were furious in this climate. A massive march on Rome took place in March, again, still to Che, bowing to the will of the people. King Victor Emmanuel ordered Mussolini to his palace where he informed him that he was removing him from office gods then came in, arrested most Illini and took him into custody venue. Italian Prime Minister Pietro by Dalia was intense on breaking the alliance with Germany and signing an armistice with the allies. However, in order to stall for time, he kept up the ruse of an alliance with Hitler. Unsurprisingly, when Hitler learns that the new ruler had signed an armistice on September the third in 1943 he was furious.

Speaker 1:          17:59          He ordered a full scale invasion of his former ally. Nazi forces used to blitzkrieg tactics do you storm and capture room forcing the king and it's prime minister to flee the city. Some elements of the Italian army attempted to resist, but many of them simply threw down their arms and surrendered. Meanwhile, muscly and he was being held at a resort towns prison in the Alps. He knew the situation was chaotic. That was surprised to see German and standing right outside of a cell window. Video admins quickly overpowered the gods and made their way into most of the new cell. Why? One of them said, elder chain, the furor and to me to set you free most of the, and he was taken to hit list East Prussia headquarters. Hitler genuinely admired my and considered him a great influence on his own career, but he was disappointed to see the man before him all of Mysoline his will to continue the fascist struggle, a deserted him.

Speaker 1:          18:46          The fear was dumbfounded. When was the lady asked if he could be permitted to retire from public life? Hello, we'd have none of us. If you installed Mussolini as the puppet ruler of northern Italy, which was now in the hands of the Nazis for the next 18 months, my Illini played this role and impotent leader who ruled over a people who hated him all the while he was surrounded by arms, Nazis and the approaching allies with the writing well and truly on the wall. Most selenium trying to escape to Switzerland's on April the 27th of 1945 just short of the border, he was intercepted by communists suit, took him and his companions into custody. The following day. They decided to execute him along with his long time mistress Clara Petacci. After riddling the bodies with bullets, the Communists drove them into Milan and dumped them in the middle of the town square for hours.

Speaker 1:          19:30          The citizens of Milan to accounts, they're amnesty on the man who had led them to disaster his body. It was spat on, stoned, beaten, and finally strung up by the feet that are the body of the ones who revered leader was subjected to the abuse of the Kraut. His corpse was eventually thrown into an unmarked grave. So I really hope you enjoyed the video.
