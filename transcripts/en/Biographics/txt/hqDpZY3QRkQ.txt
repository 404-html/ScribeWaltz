Speaker 1:          00:00          He was a man who was impossible to ignore the flamboyant character with a cigar and a $50,000 pinky ring. Although he weighed over 250 pounds. He could when the occasion demands or did move with a lethal speed and force is generally smile contrasted with the two scars that streaked across his left cheek. Then there was his clothing, his wardrobe. It was nothing short of outrageous custom tailored purple suits. Pella, gray fedoras and diamond encrusted stick pens. He loved attention once he'd be able to adore him even as he ruthlessly dispatched those who we have no useful. His name was Al Capone and he has become the symbol of American greed and corruption in the 1920s and thirties when he's eyes on January the 25th of 1947 the New York Times called him a monster symbol of a disease which was eating into the consciousness of America about the paper it went on to say the home was incredible. The creation of an evil dream. Yes. Almost everything that the public thought they knew about him nams, the most of us think we know today is false. The products of decades of glorification and mythmaking. I did today's biographics video. We're going to peel back the layers to discover the real al Capone.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Yeah, no.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Gabrielle and Theresa Component made the big move from Sicily to New York in 1894 they ended up in a four room at flat on Park Avenue adjacent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard with a couple, had two sons into the youngest who was just a few months souls. Third boy followed shortly after their arrival boulder by trade. Gabrielle was looking for a new life in America. What he found was a city in which immigrants were viewed as lower citizens, Italians, especially with vilified by Americans who blamed the spiraling crime rates and there's a New York was experiencing on them. Yeah. The components, they were a hard working family. They were law abiding and trying to fit in to their new society.

Speaker 2:          02:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:00          When the fourth son Alfonse was born in 1899 the family had settled into a decent market, hard existence, life around the Brooklyn Naval Yard. It was pretty rough and tumble, and then by the age of 10 young Al Capone had begun to exhibit to the toughness and brashness that he carried into his adult life. From the start, Alan merged as a natural leader at the age of 14 he forms the Navy street gang in order to protect Italian women from harassment from the Irish neighbors by now had been expelled from school for punching a female teacher in the face. But you know what he said? Well, she ended in first just prior to World War One, the components, they moved down to the Italian [inaudible] Gabrielle's head down and get on with the data team was paying off and it's Al found himself in an upwardly mobile middle class. The university still further up the hill though was where the really wet off people left this area. It was strictly off limits to the likes of the components. The teenage owl looks upon this area and via size. This was where the Rockefellers nibs and the feisty teaming saw reason why he couldn't live the Rockefeller wait. He just got to find a means.

Speaker 2:          03:04          Guesstimate.

Speaker 1:          03:10          By the age of 19 Al had become a local tough. He knew how to use a gun and a knife. He was a big British draw that you could knock him out into the grounds with a single punch. It also finds himself a family. On December the 30th 1918 he married, made Kauflin. It was two years older than him. Three weeks previously may have given birth to their son, Elvis family life and encouraged vein to get on the straight and narrow, intense on turning to a respectable life worthy of his wife and child. He moved the family out of the neighborhood and away from the bad influences. They shifted the Baltimore and Al took a job as a bookkeeper. Ironically, this straight job, we'd come in handy down the track when he was juggling millions of dollars and from bootleg liquor. Now that could have been the end of the story for our phones and make your pain. They could have settled into an uneventful life of respectability in Baltimore. Maybe even work their way up the social ladder to gain some community status. But wow. Allows we well know that wasn't it.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:12          With a sudden death of his father of a heart attack, Al's flirtation with respectability. Well, it was over. He returned for the funeral and soon found that the family, we're now looking to him for guidance as well as financial support that would require more money than he was earning as a bookkeeper in Baltimore. Meanwhile, the local gang that Al had pulled away from an outgrowth of the Manhattan based five points, gang, they were at a crossroads six months earlier and Afi, a big wig in Chicago named big Jim Coliseum have been shot dead and leader of the gang. That component pulled away from Johnny Toria was intent on stepping into the vacuum created by big gyms demise. He invited component to join him as his right hands, man. Sorry. You had been grooming component for the last couple of years. They'd given him a job as a collector to ensure extortion payments were made. Oh, he soon graduated to become the main bouncer and bartender at the Harvard Inn on Coney island.

Speaker 2:          05:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Now it was one line to this established and then the dowels hold Avion or patron that she had a nice rear ends. The girl's brother, well, she doesn't take so kindly to the remark and in an instant had carved up Capone's face with a bottle open up for the rest of his life. Our would carry dual stripes down his cheek giving rise to the name Scarface.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Now, while they had been in Baltimore, rumors had circulated an owl had been involved in a couple of murders. One prostitute, he was suspected of withholding pin money, and the other was a friend who'd reneged on a gambling debt. All of this was bringing unwanted police attention to the gang, and shortly after his father's funeral, deponent was called to a meeting with lucky Luciano, a key member of the gang. So what's going on now? It's it to avast nervously. I'll tell you what's going on. Ac on her applied, you're going to get the hell out of town. Don't bother to pack Lucy on Luciana. He then handed out an envelope which contained $2,000 which is about $25,000 in today's money and directed him to go straight to grand central station had for Chicago.

Speaker 2:          06:13          Right.

Speaker 1:          06:19          I'll arrived in Chicago in 1921 ready, willing and eager to none the rights. He left his wife and maybe behind in Brooklyn with instructions to follow one set established then you life. The challenge now for Johnny Tario, the leader of the gang was to get an al Capone to stop using his fists and start using his brains in order to succeed in the rackets. He put Capone in the position of head bouncer and bartender at the Ford uses a four story building which serves as Torreos general officers, which also housed a saloon and a cafe. The top floor of this establishment, well that was a brothel and Al apparently spent quite a lot of time on that floor where he wasn't exactly working. Indeed, his sexual proclivities resulted in a lifelong battle with syphilis.

Speaker 2:          07:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:06          This, it was no place for the weak of heart. Countless unsolved murders took place there with al playing a leading hand in dispatching those who tario wanted to eliminate it. In fact, Adelaide did so well within the year that he was made a partner sharing in the $100,000 annual profits. Now it's Oreo talk about how to portray an air of respectability even as he delved deeper and deeper into the underworld. As a cover, our opens a secondhand furniture store next door. He carry business cards announcing his occupation as furniture dealer. As Chicago authorities began to crack down and organized crime Torrio spread his business interests into the suburbs and the suburbs. Local police and politicians, well, they can be controlled more easily. In fact, it was torreos expansion beyond Chicago. That was the key to the development of the empire that Capone would eventually inherit. By the time component arrived in the windy city. Sorry, I had already set up vice gambling and prostitution operations in the nearby town of Burnham. Then with the election of crime busting Chicago. Now William need divine. In October of 1923 the entire base of the operation was moved to the western suburb of road.

Speaker 1:          08:24          The plan was to make Cicero a wide open town, whether again, good pedal booze and accommodate gamblers at will to do so sorry. He reached an agreement with the authorities to shut down his brothels in Cicero so long as he had free reign on the other two arms of his business by cutting the police and politicians in on the profits. Johnny soon develops the operation he wants us within six months of moving in. The outfit owns the town of Cicero, lock, stock, and barrel.

Speaker 2:          08:55          Why

Speaker 1:          08:56          January of 1924 Tory, I felt so confident in his position that he embarks on a trip back to the old country when he planned to set his mother up in a fine home in Venice and this absence would be in charge. Alice fest challenges to make sure that the officials who had his back, well, that they stayed in office, the local elections were to be held in April and component, was prepared to go to any lengths to keep the incumbents in office. Well, what's the way Al Capone? You would do this? Well, that would be by bringing some extra muscle. He brought his two older brothers, Ralph and frank over from New York. The brothers thought nothing of destroying balance and replacing them with votes for that own candidates. Everyone kind of just went along with whatever the Capones did. The police, the sheriff, even the state's attorney, they all went along with this apparently deciding that it was futile to try and pose them.

Speaker 1:          09:45          On the day of the election and Cicero tario Capone, gangsters used guns and fists to intimidate voters, escorting them to the ballot box and watching them drop their votes for the incumbent mayor directly into the box on his polar watches and election officials were held captive until after the ballot closed on honest citizens as well. Obviously they were outraged at this. Some of them even cools upon Chicago. Judge Edmond DG Iraqi to do something about the Cicero gang directly deputized 70 Chicago cops. He went into Cicero in plain clothes and unmarked black sedans. They seem spotted frank Capone on the street going in down Widleen his body with

Speaker 2:          10:20          bullets.

Speaker 1:          10:27          When our heard about his brothers sleeping, all of the sophistication that Tario had imbued him over the last year was ripped away. His savage nature was unleashed as he vowed to take revenge. It's a goal of torreos persuasive skill to keep it in check, but I he was not able to keep Capone out of a spotlight staying in the backgrounds having als mines. It cost them life of his brother. Sorry. No, he continued to preach nonviolence. You're resorting to brute force when all else fails, but the name of Al Capone, well that was synonymous with violence. This is something that's pretty well illustrated in contemporary culture. We've got a clip here, thanks to boardwalk empire

Speaker 1:          11:13          pretty nicely sums up how we see al Capone. Now try as he might to follow these leaders. Advice component was plagued by mayhem and a temporary found difficult to control. AL's based nature was combative rather than diplomatic and it resulted in an awful lot of bloodshed in the years that were to come. Alice pent up emotions over the death of his brother. Frank, we're given expression on the evening of May the eighth I'm 1924 his partner in a prostitution ring jacket music had been roughed up by an Irish target named Joe Howard fault, refusing him alone, composing immediately tracked down Howard in a bar and demanded to know what it's happens. Howard took one look and Capone calls him a Daigo pimp and then told them to get lost. At this point is Capone pulls out his pistol and shot Howard in the face and he did this in front of dozens of witnesses.

Speaker 1:          12:08          The more it never convicted out for this breeze is murder, but the press, they sat and he did the original story identifying him as our Brown, but when it was picked up by other papers, it was corrected to Alphonse component. This was really the beginning of his public persona and when he became famous for it, less than a year later in January of 1925 Johnny Tario was ambushed by rival gang members. He came within an inch of losing his life surviving and we need to have a nine month prison terms slapped on him for operating an illegal brewery. While so he decided that he'd had enough of the Chicago madness. By the end of that year, it completely handed the reins over to Capone and he disappeared.

Speaker 2:          12:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:49          He inherited the goals of mine from Johnny Tario that was fueled by a highly organized operation that operated largely behind the scenes. In fact, the duplicity was so complete that 99% of the citizens of Cicero never even saw a gangster, rather than I'll be used the government to control the area with noncompliant merchants being plagued with higher taxes and loss of parking in front of their stores, but they quickly got the message and they got into line

Speaker 1:          13:19          now component set his sights on the north side of Chicago to make some headway. He first had to subjugate the deadliest gang Chicago ever known. The generous they operated in the open, even having police protection. The Jenna's also had been major suppliers of alcohol to the Tario Capone [inaudible] and it's Capone heard even supported them in their battles with other gangs. But after crushing the rivalry, Banyan Gang, the Germans decided to take over the Capone empire. It would prove to be their undoing. The Jenna's selected a couple of Sicilians to assassinate Capone, however it recognizing components power and fearful. That's such an attempt would lead to that own demise. The Sicilian duo informed Capone of the Jenna's intentions, how convinced them to turn on the janitors and in short order, they had killed three of the Gen ed brothers, the remaining three brothers, while they fled to Sicily with the Jana as well.

Speaker 1:          14:10          They were out of the way to play it now, how to deal with the survivors of the O'bannon gang who had rated components, headquarters and number of times on one particular occasion there to use eight touring costs. They first shot blanks to newer people outside and then followed with a live ammunition like kill the Capone on the spot. There is, well, it didn't work though. Over 1000 rounds were fired. Miraculously. No one was killed. I was convinced that the brain's buying this attempted hit was Hymie Weiss leader of the Albanian gang. Anti immediately ordered the death of this man. They hit men, set themselves up across from Weiss's flower shop and waited and waited and waited. After a week they finally spotted Weiss walking towards his shop. They killed him and free of his body guards successfully stepping into the vacuum created by the killing of Hymie. Weiss was bugs. Moron who was eager to get rid of Capone as why is it been more, has plenty of guts but little common sense. He publicly denounced hipbone, especially for paddling bad women and bad alcohol constantly on the attack. Moran's troops launched in number of forays against Capone's businesses.

Speaker 1:          15:19          By February of 1929 campaign has had enough. He ordered a massive hit on Capone to take place on some Valentine's date because this guy is does policemen and did Moran's warehouse and caught the seven victims off guard facing them towards the wall as if they're going to frisk them. They then move them down with machine gun. Fire around was not among them this attack, but it was enough to scare him off. Having eliminates is all opposition on the north side of Chicago. Deponent now focused on the south after a number of killings. His rivals, well, they sued for peace, agreeing to give owl in large slice of their operation.

Speaker 1:          15:59          My March of 1929 Al Capone, he was the undisputed king of Chicago being portrayed to the public as the ultimate Gangsta. Yet at the same time he was being read the riot acts by his peers. The years the leaders of organized crime had been holding annual meetings to discuss matters of mutual concern. Now the matter of mutual concern, well, it was what to do with Al Capone. Al Had attracted a tremendous amount of unwanted attention with the St Valentine's Day massacre. He was bringing too much unwanted attention as the king as well. All the time had come for him to be neutralized. The commission decreed that Joseph, Elio and old enemy of Capone would be put in place in Chicago to keep our in check. The poem would also have to see it as gambling operations. To the commission. Capone was privately outraged that the condition was muzzling him in this way, but he was also smart enough to know that if he protested, he would quickly be eliminated.

Speaker 1:          16:51          He decided to take the advice of the commission and line no for awhile and just wash that away to safety line low than from inside a jail cell. Within 16 hours of coming out to the commission meeting component had been arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. Deponent trusted is $50,000 diamond pinky ring to his attorney with instructions to give it to his brother Ralph, who would become acting hedges until he returns. He then began a 12 month JL town when he emerged from his prison cell in March of 1930 the pine discovered that the climate's, it had changed. He had been listed as public enemy number one by the FBI. The federal government now considered him a menace to society and was prepared to do anything to put him behind bars for good. It was certain that Al was violating the Volstead act by selling liquor, but they were not able to prove it.

Speaker 1:          17:38          Not even Elliot Ness. Auntie's untouchables, were able to stop the pain. Finally, the FBI decided that their best chance at putting the phone away was to convicted of tax evasion, was used to being cheered when he attended public events, but now that the government was bringing income tax evasion charges against him crowds, they started booing. Yeah. What's worse is formerly failproof methods of fixing the outcomes of trials. They were having no effects. Owl did manage to bribe several jury members, but on the day of the trial, the judge switched the jury panel. From that moment on, Virginia's were sequestered and they were out of Al's reach after presenting a damaged case, which highlighted a life of lavish spending, yet virtually no tax payments. The prosecution concluded by reminding the jury that Capone was no Robin Hood. He spent wildly on himself and his cronies doing nothing to help the poor and the down and out.

Speaker 1:          18:30          The judge found him guilty on three counts of tax evasion and on October the 24th 1931 he was sentenced to 11 years in prison. This was the harshest sentence ever handed down for tax evasion Capone. Well, he felt that now his gangland associates would rally to his age, but he just didn't get it. Maybe it has advancing syphilis. It's something to do with this, but the reality was that had been artfully shunted aside at the Atlantic City meeting in 1929 now two years later, it was life was out in the open for all to see and he had a felony conviction to his name. He was anathema to his format gangland buddies. They ignored it. Deponent spent most of his time in an Atlanta prison and then spent the last three years of his sentence of Alcatraz. By then his syphilis, it's serious and eroded his mental faculties. By the time he died of cardiac arrest on January the 25th of 1947 doctors concluded that he had the mind of a 12 year old child and well, that was all for hours.
