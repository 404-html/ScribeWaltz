Speaker 1:          00:00          It was the height of the depression and America was in desperate need of a hero. They found it in the most unlikely of places. Butler, who looked about as beat up as the nation itself for a race horse, he didn't have much going for him. His legs were too short. Is An Equis too thick and you had a swing for lag that jutted out wildly? Well, first of all, we had a mind of his own when he felt like running ad run and when he did, and he simply wouldn't, it's hard to believe that this was say horse that lost his first 17 starts. We'd become a legends. The greatest resource in history and this episode of biographics not looking at a person, but indeed we're looking at the amazing story of Seabiscuit the horse that brought the nation together.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Seabiscuit was born home or accurately falls on May the 23rd 1933 in Lexington, Kentucky. He was the son of a nasty tempered rogue and namd hardtack and Denzel man named swing on seabiscuits. Father had greet speed, no doubt owing to his pedigree. His father, man of war was considered by most experts at the time to be the greatest race horse who ever was produced. Although his grandson would certainly go on to challenge that claim. The problem with hardtack was that he was uncontrollable. Even Hall of fame trainer, Sunny Jim Fitz Simmons couldn't tame him. See, this gets mother. It was the complete opposite of heart attack. She was a calm, gentle horse with thick knees and short legs swinging on. It wasn't very fast though, so she never raced the cold that she signed. It didn't look very promising. His legs were study. His knees were thick. Antinori sort of funny.

Speaker 1:          01:40          When he ran, even seabiscuits color was against him. He was a solid, muddy bay with new distinguishing white stripe or star on his face. So these sources, they were all loans by Ogden Mills, secretary of the US Treasury, as well as his sister, Mrs Hc fibs. They're racing staple was one of the finest in America with no expense being spared in the care and training of the horses. However, Mrs fibs insisted that only horses that would bring honor to the stable would be caps. The reason that hardtack and swing on still around was that they both had very strong pedigrees. I always hoped that that offspring would have amazing speed during his first year. You best get along with his mother was put into a 50 acre pasture with Nadine, other thoroughbred mares and then newborn false. So in every group of cults that are usually two that stand out, one is the hero, the better looking, more graceful and foster one and the other is the outcast and awkward warranty looking little fellow who looked as if he slipped in when no one was watching.

Speaker 1:          02:39          In this group, the hero is Granville Mans the outcast. Well that, we'll see this get, but something in cvs gets to downsize to keen observers. Several times a day the cults would race up and down the paddock with Seabiscuit always at the rear. Yeah. The gangly colts was never discouraged. The father and he was left behind. The harder he drove himself and the longer the race, the narrow he came to catching up with his big heads and short spindly legs. Seabiscuit spends more energy than other cults running. As a result of this. He had a launch wrap or something from the other cults and even developed a stronger and tougher leg muscles and by late that fall he was no longer running at the back of the pack. Emerging as a yearling on January the first 1934 see this gets looked more like a ragged range pony than a thoroughbred.

Speaker 1:          03:22          He fell to shout his winter coat and his legs and back where a few inches shorter than average. In fact, he was such an ugly duckling. The wind, Mrs Fibs came in April to inspect their horses. See, this guy was as in a way and an outlying bomb by now. They see this kid had found his running legs. He was challenging Grandville for the lead. It may not have had to have the physical attributes of the other horses, but it was full of stamina and determination. So by mid summer, these rivals, they were absolutely racing neck and neck and it was then that Seabiscuit develops or habits that would be the trademark that he'd carry for the rest of his life. Whenever they were vying for the lead, he would snort at Grandville. There's an attempt to do bully him and throw him on pace.

Speaker 2:          03:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:10          In June of 1934 Grandville and cbus gifts that they were ships to Sunny Jim Fitz Simmons recognized as perhaps the finest strainer in the country, but Simmons had developed a hatred for seabiscuits father hardtack after years of being unable to break him, and there's a vicious habits. It also given up on the swing on finding her to slow and lazy. This it did not bode well for Seabiscuit. If at Simmons looked upon as a curse from the very beginning, he put the majority of his energy into training Granville while forcing Seabiscuit to conform. See this get. Meanwhile, it was determines not to comply. He simply refused to go fast. Finally, an exasperated Fitzsimmons gave his jockey a wooden stake and told him, hits the biscuit just as many times as you can in a quarter mile. They run them against Faust, the fastest sprinter among the group and trying to escape these severe beating Seabiscuit exploded around the track leaving Faust foreign his wake.

Speaker 1:          05:02          He ran the quarter mile in 22 seconds and two fifths and if you don't know, this is an incredibly good time and amaze to Fitzsimmons, but it also confirmed in his mind that seabiscuits would only show his potential under severe punishments. When on January the 31st 1935 the horses under Fitzsimmons became two year olds Seabiscuit. It was tossed aside. It was put to work. I say Hack Raisa. On January the 19th he was entered into a shorter race, losing by four and a half lengths. During 1935 he ran a total of 35 races, losing the first 17 which was not exactly a brilliant start. It was only when his jockey stopped beating him and let him run his own race that he showed real promise. He wound up five races setting three track records in the process. Still that Simmons, he was desperate to get rid of him.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Convinced to that Seabiscuit was an inconsistent, no hope that on August the third 1936 the Fitzsimmons entered seabiscuits in the $6,000 claiming stakes at. Fortunately for him, this just happens to be one of those days when see this get decided to turn it on. He won by six full lengths up in the stands and all the time veteran cowboy and veteran trainer named Tom Smith, so heart and courage in seabiscuits. He decided that he had to have him a week later to see this gets, he was purchased by Charles Howard for $8,000 and hand it over to Tom Smith the training. The horse finally had a trainer who both respected him and saw his limitless potential. Seabiscuit was subjected to an intense conditioning campaign. There was that no one wants. It suddenly was pampered and grooms with a focus on foot care. In order to recover from the grueling schedule, you had been forced to India or under Fitz Simmons as a result of the care and attention that was lavished upon him.

Speaker 1:          06:43          See, this gets began performing more consistently on the practice track. Either became gentler and seem to develop a competitive spirit. He also developed a huge appetite eating anything that was put before him to keep his weight down. Grooms are instructed to muzzle him at night in order to prevent him from eating his straw bedding. A combination of patients, kindness and skillful training of Tom Smith initially to transform seabiscuits courage and intelligence into raw, unbridled speed, although is needed now is to match Seabiscuit with the right jockey. Smith found him in the form of Jack Red Polardy Feisty, 27 year olds, Canadian who'd been roaming around the West riding and boxing for over a decade is other thoroughbreds was as deep as Tom Smith. Yes. Although the was one of the better drug is on the Bush circuit had only won three state races in his life. When red first entered, cbus get stalled.

Speaker 1:          07:32          The horse was busy munching on Straw. See this get looked up, gave us snort and then ambled over to Paula and rubbed his muzzle against red shoulder as well. With that, one of history's greatest partnerships was born satisfied. He was ready how it ended Seabiscuit into a series of races in Detroit into races, the Detroit governors handicap and the Scarsdale handicap. He came at home first and I think $12,900 in prize money for his owner over the next two months. Their winnings accrued to a remarkable $40,000 a delighted Howard gave him a two month vacation and then the 1936 see this get to, he was sent by rail to California to compete in his last two races are three roles. The first it was the bay bridge handicap despite starting badly red and Seabiscuit soon found their stride and they won by five lengths in their last race of the year for Wells Fargo Handicap.

Speaker 1:          08:23          They led from the start cruising to an easy victory, but at the beginning of 1937 as kids was beginning to develop a reputation as an pumpin coming champion. The focus in the early part of the year was marches Santa Anita Cup, the biggest race on the west coast. Seabiscuit started the year well winning a warmup, raisins answer Niesr in January. Then in the San Antonio Handicap, he was bumped at the start and to pushed wide finishing a disappointing Beth and now, well, it was time for the big one, the $125,000 center and Nita Cup coming. The home straight Seabiscuit was half a length ahead of Rosemont the horse, which had one the week before it. San Antonio, but it's Red Polos who was blinded is right. I didn't know that Roselands was closing in and failed to Seabiscuit into the next year. Rosemont's won by a nose. This disappointment though, it was followed by three easy wins. Establishing seabiscuits gets reputation on the west coast as the breakout thoroughbred of the year.

Speaker 1:          09:18          By this time, Charles Howard, he was making some pretty great money off this investments, but he wanted more. He was determined that cbus get to be recognized as the greatest resource in the entire United States. That means breaking in to the far more prestigious east coast circuit. So between June the 26th and August the seventh he entered Seabiscuit into five east coast races. He won every single one of them. He finished 1937 with a record, 11 wins out of 15 races and was the biggest money on it in the country. It was also now the most famous horse in America with the press having a field day with his underdog story, the nation's most prestigious and quite an award. However, it did not go to Seabiscuit that year. The winner of the American horse of the year award was the darling of the East Coast Psat or admiral who had just won the coveted triple crown.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Interestingly, war admiral and see biscuits, they're actually blood relatives. See where the son and grandson of one of the greatest thoroughbreds in history, man of war, CPS gets farther. Heart attack was war admirals brother. In 1937 war admiral won every race he started including the triple crown. This prestigious honor is bestowed upon thoroughbreds that win three major races in succession. The Kentucky Derby Preakness stakes and Belmont stakes, but we're admirals. Victory of bell mums when it was bitter sweet and injury prevented him from racing again for several months or admiral was a natural competitor. The life of the activity of race day seem to fill him with nervous excitement. He was so competitive. It was difficult for handlers to hold him back when the saddling bell rang. His temperaments was fiery and skittish just like his brother Han Tak, but this personality that usually worked to his advantage, he never willingly walked into the gate and once the starters got him in, he would act up causing delays and full stops.

Speaker 1:          11:11          At the beginning of the 1938 war admirals, the best horse in the east and Seabiscuit was the best horse in the west race. Fans were anxious for the city of champions to meet. That's Charles. Howard knew that despite the public's fascination with is unlikely star if see this gives were to be taken seriously as a challenge to war admiral. We'd have to establish his own reputation in the east. Howard was a must promote them and it's capitalized on establishing racing rivalry between the east coast and the west coast. He was determined to prove that a horse coming out of California, it could be the equal of anything that ran into the east and it was at this point that be began issuing public challenges to Sam Riddle. The own revoir. Admiral riddle ignored him considering it demeaning for his champion thoroughbreds to meet a Western horse, but after months of incessant media chiding well, he finally agreed.

Speaker 1:          12:08          The question of it was the fastest horse in the United States would be decided by weight of a race to be held at the PIMLICO racetrack in Baltimore, Maryland. This would take place on November the first 1938 the distance was to be one and 16 miles result insisted, however, that the race begin with no gate or a walkup start in order to avoid war admirals, temperamental behavior in the gate. How it agreed to start the race where the starting bell, but he also had a condition. The track had to be fast or dry. Seabiscuits he did not run well in mud. If the track was to west because of rain, the race, it would be called off. Then things while they started to go wrong in the Seabiscuit camp, red polo fractured his leg while working with another horse and he wasn't able to race Paula as good friends and fellow top jockey.

Speaker 1:          12:51          George to the iceman wolf would ride Seabiscuit and stat. Up until that time, every match recent history had been won by the horse that was in the lead from the start throughout all of his races in 1937 a war admiral, a peasant never let another horse in front of him. Yeah. Seabiscuits. He was a come from behind winner or admirals trainer George Conway and Druggie Charlie, Kurt Singer, work confidence that that horse was faster than Seabiscuit. This men's, they concentrated on building war admiral stamina to endure the mile long distance. Meanwhile, Tom Smith was concentrating on the start of the race. He put together a starting bell that sounded like the starting Bella Pimlico when he rang the bell. Wolf cracks the whip on seabiscuits backside. This condition, cvs gets to run the ads top speed immediately. The rest of the century. It was a worldwide sensation. The racetrack was so crowded that 10,000 people crowded outside the gates sitting in trees and standing on car moves to try and to see the race across the United States.

Speaker 1:          13:48          40 million people tuned to their radios in. Many of them didn't care about horse racing previously, but now they were. Kings at here is three being made most of them while they were rooting for [inaudible], Johnny curtsying over on war, Admiral wore black and yellow silks and road the rail while George Wolfe with red and white silks sitting astride see this Skitch took the outside or admiral prepared for the race the way he always did raring up and tormenting his handlers. Meanwhile, Seabiscuit commonly headed for the post. The flag was raised in the horses lined up, but just as the start who was about to ring the bell will pulled Seabiscuit back. It was a tactic to make war admiral nervous when they're lined up a second time cards. Singapore, this horseback on the third try. Both horses lined up at exactly the same moment. The starter bell rang and they were off the two thoroughbreds pounded down the track, neck and neck.

Speaker 1:          14:34          It was commonly believed that war admiral would take the early lead so the crowds were astonished when Wolf cracks the whip and see this get edged in front around the first turn and see this get was still in the lead or veered left and took the rail from cad singer. Then he slowed cvs get right down in front of war admiral in order to conserve cuts, singer, now we they have to slow down himself or possible war admiral drew closer to see biscuits, but it was still, I had to buy a length and a half going into the backstretch. The distance widens by two lengths. Then Kurt Singer cracks the whip and in just a few strides, Warren admiral was even with Seabiscuit the crowd by this point, there were going absolutely wild horses challenge down the straight and neck and neck. Then we're having real took the lead but only for a moment to see biscuits sped up.

Speaker 1:          15:17          He was once again in front turning into the stretch. It was anybody's race rounds rounded the far town and we're headed for home. They were a couple of shoulder to shoulder, had to had ITI around the town as they headed for home. Wolf cracks the whip asking Seabiscuit for everything he has. He loosened the reigns and the horse answered, dropping his Jen is his pins back and to race towards the finish line. The crowd, they were astounded to see Seabiscuit breakaway by one, then two, then three lengths in the end, what it was, no contest. Seabiscuits was the winner by four lengths leaving war admiral in his dust. A Seabiscuit slowed to a gallop. Thousands of fans burst through the infield chasing their underdog hero in the winner's circle. Seabiscuit was donged with a blanket of yellow flowers or admirals bond. That's they're defeated champion and stepped away almost unnoticed.

Speaker 1:          16:03          Seabiscuit was now not only the national racing champion, but the fastest and most famous horse in the wells. He easily won horse of the year in 1938 however, the joy for cbus get it was short lived in the next race. He ruptured ligament in his leg. He spent most of 1939 healing and Howard ranch in California. They come back for both Seabiscuit and jockey read prologues still recovering from his own leg injury was to be the 1940 at Santa Anita handicap during the race. Seabiscuit got caught in a pocket which red tried desperately to get out of. Finally finding his gap. He yells, now pops, see this, get broke through, took the lead and definitely goes back.

Speaker 2:          16:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Following the sounds around the victory. Seabiscuit retired with a record of 33 victories from 89 races. He had downs. Charles Howard, $438,000 and American record at the time. See this get died suddenly of a heart attack on the the 17th 1947 three years later, Charles Howard source nor one the 1950s sensor. He's a handicap when it reports have suggested that perhaps it founds another cvs, get he answered so that will never be another see, discuss. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
