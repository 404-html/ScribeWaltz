Speaker 1:          00:00          Night of being photographed shirtless and alongside wild animals, rabbits. At the same time, Vladimir Putin, he's cultivated an image as an intimidating and fearless figure on the world stage. He's a martial arts expert, but fearless political actor and a former spy is resume holds a certain cachet in the west. As a former KGB agents, he's automatically associated with secrecy, intimidation, and the old fears Americans had of the Soviet Union for much of the 21st century policing instead of himself that he lives in long time as an ordinary person, ordinary Ms. all he wishes to be for decades, though he hasn't been anything but ordinary as he spent his life climbing the ranks of the Russian government's moving farther and farther away from his ordinary roots.

Speaker 1:          00:59          He was born in Saint Petersburg in 1957 in the midst of the Cold War. Putin, he had two older brothers, but unfortunately both died during childhood, so Puson, he was raised essentially as an only child. He was an atheist as a child, but today he's an eastern Orthodox Christian. During Putin's childhood, his mother stayed at home and his father, a veteran of world war two, worked in a factory as an interesting aside here, his grandfather was a cook. He works for Vladimir Lenin and even prepared meals for stolen a few times the pigeon family. They lived in a communal apartment shared by three families, a home where Putin says he used to hunt rats in the stairwell. Perhaps a precursor to you is later fascination with hunting Manz with wild animals in general.

Speaker 2:          01:44          No, no.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Growing up, it didn't prove himself to be anything particularly special in his early years, but then by the age of 12 he discovered athletic competition. It was in the midst of a competition that Putin began to set himself apart. Martial arts was his chosen sport, particularly sambo and judo. Though his mother did not initially approve of his participation in these sports boots and proved himself to be a worthy and skilled competitor in both. At one point, his coach even showed up at the pigs and home to speak with his mother about how much promise that image showed. Well, I was actually that the did the trick and his parents began to support his athletic pursuits. These in now holds a black belt in judo and just continued to compete in both sambo and judo, establishing himself as the first world leader to be at an advanced level in these sports.

Speaker 1:          02:32          He also remains the presidents at the same Dojo he practiced in while growing up though he established himself as athletically talented person, did not excel academically in school during his challenges. He attended a local school for his early years and then attended a magnet school focused on chemistry. He didn't push himself, but his teacher saw that he did have potential and they encouraged him to focus as much on his school work as he did on his martial arts practice. It was in the sixth grade when really began to push himself and that showed in his grades. He was welcomed to the Young Pioneers, the youth group that was run by the Communist Party. This was a serious mark of honor is pizza and had previously been one of only a few from the class who had not been welcomed into the organization now from 1970 to 1975 feet in, continued his studies at some Petersburg State University. While there he studied law and was required to join the communist party. He later left the posse denouncing communism in 1991. When he said of Marxism Leninism this, it became more and more obvious for me, more obvious that it was nothing more than a beautiful and harmful fairytale in Petersburg state university pten. Matt's Anatoly Sobchak who would become a key figure in Putin's political success. Self check was an assistant professor at the school, but he actually went on to co author the constitution of the Russian Federation and was also the first democratically elected mayor of some Peter's though.

Speaker 3:          03:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Who's in graduated from Saint Petersburg State University in 1975 and it was then that he joined the KGB. KGB was the Soviet Union Security Agency for much of the 20th century. It was created in 1954 and continued to operate until 1991 when the Soviet Union itself was dismantles. It translated to English. KGB stands for state security committee. It has a reputation for oppression and monitoring the actions and opinions of Soviet citizens. KGB. It was a truly frightening organization for democracy as an indication of the dangers of communism to Westerners, the organization rebellions and kept a close eye on anyone suspected to be an opposition to the Soviet regime who didn't started his career with the KGB in Leningrad boss. He was a to move to do Dresden, Germany before was transferred to Germany. Putin married to this very day. Putin keeps his home life are very private and information about his family is very closely guarded.

Speaker 1:          04:56          He and his wife lived. Millard were married from 1983 until the divorce in 2013, that divorce that was seemingly amicable with no specific reason given for it though Lynn Miller made references to Putin's dedication to his work and the time investment required to serve as a world leader. They have two daughters together, Maria and tax arena, both of whose lives remain incredibly secrets. They both used fake names to go and register for college and it's not entirely known in which country either of the daughters currently lives in 2016 European newspapers even described and Maria as a secret daughter noticing if she had not been willing to be photographed during the entire length of Putin's time and power for a former spy and they man with many, many enemies. It's sensible that his daughters have maintains this secret life who didn't indeed a status either private life in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected, so pretend he moved with his family to

Speaker 3:          05:58          Dresden where he served with the KGB for five years. He was fluent in German and still speaks this language to this day. Auntie stated that he actually feels more comfortable using German than English. Putin served in this dresden posts from 1985 to 1990, working as an undercover agents playing the part of a translator. The work, though not all of our peers in the dead is known. It was the spy after all, it wasn't particularly interesting. Much of it was simply amassing information on people, ensuring that they remain loyal to the Soviet. Some we're not passing any kind of revolution. In 1999, though the situation it became rather than more dicey for Soviet see were stationed in Dresden during one incident as it became more and more clear that he's German, he was falling out of Soviet control. Putin and his colleagues feared for their lives as crowds stormed the KGB headquarters in Dresden. Booty calls in the Soviet military for how the birds. He was told that nothing could be done for them and less Moscow gave the order something that Moscow never did. While Putin and his colleagues well, they survived that day, it has become increasingly clear that the situation was unstable during this time. Putin ends of the KGB. Agents began burning files so that when the day came that their headquarters was either taken or abandons or both, no files would be left in the hands of the enemy.

Speaker 1:          07:17          The Berlin Wall fell in November of 1989 and soon after Peyton and his family, they returned to Russia by this point piece in held. The rank of lieutenant colonel indicates beat, however the KGB was nearing the end of its existence and Putin was able to find work at the State University of some pieces. Doug. He was no ordinary professor. They ate. He was still working for the KGB, part of his job included keeping an eye out for students who showed promise as potential new kgb recruits through his job, but he was also able to reconnect with his former professor and Natalie. Subject. Subject, he was elected the mayor of Pittsburgh in 1991 and Putin joined his team as an advisor. He works for subject until 1996 when subject last reelection losing could've opted to continue working for his successor, but Putin believes that taking a job with subjects political opponents would be disloyal. Anti. Instead chose to move to Moscow to begin working with the Yeltsin administrator.

Speaker 1:          08:19          During Boris Yeltsin presidency, pten rose through the ranks first serving as deputy chief administrative or the Kremlin. Russia is fashion of the White House in 1999, he was named secretary of the Security Council and became Yeltsin's chief advisor on matters of foreign relations and intelligence, but it was then the Putin's Korea got a real real boost. Yeltsin decided he didn't want to keep his current prime minister, so he got rid of him. That was in August of 1999 and oh, he was the beneficiary of this decision as the eldest son named Vladimir Putin and do the post Yeltsin offered Putin the position of a prime minister with prospects somewhat foreshadowing the next step in Putin's Korea because it was only months after naming buton is prime minister Boris Yeltsin himself. Steps down and Vladimir Putin became the acting president of Russia and that was in December of 1999. Then three months later, in March of 2015, he was officially elected and became president of Russia in his own

Speaker 3:          09:16          right.

Speaker 1:          09:26          10 opponents run against him for president, but he won nationals for the first time in Russia's history. There was a peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected presidents who didn't. He used his first time to advocate for certain international policies including approval of the start, two arms treaty and improving relations with China was also initially supportive of the United States, his war on terror that fully the nine slash 11 terrorist attacks, but he did not support the United States. This invasion of Iraq during Putin's first summer in power tragedy struck Russia when the cask submarine sank in the barren sea in August. Please didn't. He was on vacation when the sinking your courage and he did not immediately returned home to address the sinking and the deaths of all 118 crew members who had been on board. Then when he was asked what went wrong with the cask, Putin replied starkly that it sank destroyers and angry Russians were attacking the president for his handling or like they're all over the cask disaster with some even accusing him of leaving sailors to die when a rescue might've still been possible. That despite all of this opinion, polls showed that overall his image did not sustain much damage from the tragedy. Indeed, four years later, the cask tragedy did not affect his reelection. At all in 2004, the Russians reelected him to a second term as president, and they were apparently really pleased with the job. He was doing his speech and received over 70 percent of the volume

Speaker 1:          10:53          during his first term in office who's head focused on economic reform, having denounced communism. He instead supported an economic system that was essentially capitalism with very strict regulations and oversight. After years of economic struggle, Russia was finally beginning to see a stabilizing and even growing economy under Putin. Some reports, but Russia's grief during his first term at seven percent annually. Indeed, he still remembered favorably for this growth, though it came with increased nationalization of industry and in part because of the mid two thousands, global financial crash, the grief did not last, but in the country. He's economy was in disarray for nearly the entire decade before pten. His rise to power and area of growth in which disposable income nearly doubles was reason for the people to think really positively of Pearson. Now Pearson did work on those economic policies we already mentioned is fast done, but he also made strides in foreign relations including making a historic trip to Israel.

Speaker 1:          11:47          This was the first ever trip by a Russian leader to the country. Conversations between Putin and Israeli, focused largely on security issues. The tread gotten as much attention to around the world as it came in the midst of strengthening ties between Russia and Israel. Though the two nations disagreed on topics such as the Russian side of missiles to Syria, the trip was also seen as a move by Putin to help secure Russia's position as a key diplomatic actor in any Middle East peace discussions or agreements. Now, security issues were present not just abroad, though then homeland security would become a major focus for Putin. Unfortunately, this is something that became really clear during the horrific tragedy of the Beslan school. In 2014 in September, terrorists held over 1000 people hostage at the Beslan school in North Asitia. Nearly 800 of these hostages. They were children for three days.

Speaker 1:          12:37          These terrorists demolishing Chechen, an independence from Russia helped these people hostage situation had a tragic ending when tanks, rockets, and other artillery we used by the Russian military to try to clear the school. Special Forces entered the school after hearing explosions from inside were the hostages were being caps, but their actions, they did not save lives. Quite the contrary in the siege of the school ever. 300 people died, nearly two thirds of whom were children the tragedy. It shook the world, and while the government's was cleared of any wrongdoing, initially, the European Court of human rights later stated that Russia had used excessive force and lacked caution, and they storm into the school just bawling his anger and discontentment that the government's handling of the tragedy in general, it did not affect the public's view of pewter and very much at all, quite the opposite. In fact, a poll taken off to the best of a masochist stated that 83 percent of Russians were still happy with him.

Speaker 1:          13:25          The vessel and tragedy did lead to changes in the halls of Russian power, though primarily giving more power to the Russian president. For instance, instead of electing governors in regions like north Asitia in Chechnya, the presidents would have the power to appoint governance in 2007, and during his second term, Putin was named Time Magazine's person of the year. The magazine called the final year of his second term is most successful yet, and it's the cover photo for the issue, a portrait of Putin, one the photographer, the world press photo award. During the shoot that you've discussed them, mutual admiration for the Beatles. This connection helped you tend to become more comfortable and it's for the photographer, the chance to get an award winning shot of the intimidating world leader. No matter how popular Putin was, though that Russian people could not elect him to a third time the Russian constitution simply for credit. However, pieces and found a way around this role just when his time in office was about to years

Speaker 3:          14:15          run out.

Speaker 1:          14:26          Presidential terms in Russia had been extended to six years, but this change did not benefit Putin. He was beholding to the previous constitutional rules. So how is it you got to stay in power while the man who was elected, Russia's next presidents was Dimitri Medvedev, and he was a protege of Putin's and benefited from Putin's rise to power. Neither he nor I wanted Putin's it'd be pushed off the international stage and so medvedev unnamed Putin as Russia's prime minister, a position he had previously held under Boris Yeltsin after 13 years in leadership at present would remain as the highest levels of Russia's governments. He and his supporters were able to keep them in power and stay in line with the law, although not exactly in line with its exact intent. During his third time as prime minister from 2008 to 2012, Putin focused on dealing with the economic crisis that swept the wells as well as Russia's population problems.

Speaker 1:          15:17          Russia is population was falling by 1 million people a year, a devastating number for a country whose population is only $150 million in 2010. The trend is reversed and Russia's population began to grow. The reversal is empowered credited to Putin's economic reforms. When people have more money, it is easier to support a larger family. One of Putin's economic reforms include in joining the World Trade Organization or WTO in 2012 negotiations for rushing to join. The WTO lasted nearly two decades as they had started. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia was granted entry into the WTO. Often negotiations reached a point in which granted Russia permission to phase in the opening of markets. Wireless aligns with other WTO trading requirements.

Speaker 1:          16:06          Now all his political party retains dominance and Putin was again the candidate for president in 2012. He did not escape politically unscathed from his maneuver to hold onto power buying. Sidestepping the term limits the elections in 2012 for that heavily protested with claims of fraud tainting Putin's election to a third time. The task, if the government is not only to pour honey into a cup, but sometimes do you give it a medicine bottle display? Those protests? Well, he was inaugurated in May of 2012, and this time his term would be six years. This means that Putin will be president of Russia until at least 2018 and with allegations of his interference in the United States elections is prominence in the world. My only turn you seems to road

Speaker 1:          16:53          wheaton has continued to be reelected, reappointed to positions at the highest level of Russian government's his time in office. It's not been without questions surrounding his shady actions. Among the high points or low points we should say, of intrigue surrounding Poussin. All the murders of Russian journalists, that's of generalists were any points of concern in Russia. Longed for Putin's rise to power, but the issue well, it began to get a lot of international attention during Putin's second time as presidents when journalists, a political sky was murdered. This journalist had been a strong critic of Putin and particularly the war in Chechnya. Even before her death, she was even poisoned but ultimately recovered her mother. It remains to this day on solved, but there is suspicion that Putin and his governance, well maybe they targeted taught well. Let's. Sky is also far from the only Putin opponents.

Speaker 1:          17:40          His death has occurred in suspicious circumstances in March of 2017. The Washington Post even published a list of 10 such deaths among deaths was a former deputy prime minister and Putin critic who was shot outside the Kremlin. He was a tycoon and his death was initially called a suicide, but now that's rather unsure is also a generalist who was kidnapped and shot in the woods and the former KGB agent. He was found to be poisoned by Russian agents. Then there's the generalist who died of a mysterious illness and he's medical records have been sealed. Sajan not failing on any intriguing. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:20          I get many of these deaths may never be proven beyond doubt to be the work of Putin's government. One thing is absolutely certain Vladimir Putin does not like to be viewed as weak. He has done all he can to prevent strength and show the world that he is strong and manly. Beyond is active participation in martial arts. He shows his power and dominance by hunting, tracking, and closing with wild animals. He's caught a huge fish including a 46 pounds pike and shot a crossbow. At a whale, normally to tranquilize it though, you also want to save to camera crew from a Siberian tiger that was about to attack them while on a tour of a wildlife sanctuary. Further, he's actually got close enough to hold a bas. Do you attach a tracking device to them for a research project? Now, polar bears might look cute in your mind.

Speaker 1:          19:03          I think this is particularly dangerous, but they're actually incredibly vicious creatures. Susan is also attached himself to an experiment, so flying machine to accompany birds on my graduation, and it's important to note that he always does these things carefully, making sure that that photographer is presence. The more I know about people, the more I like dogs. I like simple animals. What? He's not hanging out with wild animals who didn't make time for other adventurous and athletic activities. He dives into black seed and explores shipwrecks, plays hockey. You ride snowmobiles and motorcycles, and does even driven a Formula One racecar once during a visit to a Russian youth camp. Even challenged attendees to arm wrestle with him then nor contends with arm wrestling as a show of strength. He trying to bend a frying pan with his bare hands. Naturally though photography his own hands, you capture all of these incredible moments and the photos have been distributed, widely viewed around the world. You've probably seen several of them from his days at school cultivating an athletic reputation to his time as president and Prime Minister Putin has made it known that he isn't mad to be recognized

Speaker 1:          20:09          during this most recent time as president with a couple of years left go, Putin has found himself centered on the world stage. Russia has been involved in the Syrian civil war, supporting the governments of Bashar al. Al sat in early july of 2017, vladimir putin and Donald Trump announced a ceasefire in southwestern Syria and weeks later Russia announced that it had signed a deal with Syria allowing Russia to keep it sad base in the country for at least 50 more years in addition to Syria. PerhAps putin's most talked about involvement haS been the alleged interference of Russia in the u. S election from hacking allegations do you questions of elicit meetings and deals with members of trump's inner circle. The u s ends the wells media. I've made putin and his political dealings, a household conversation topic, so let them be opposing. It began his life growing up in a communal apartments in the midst of Russia during the cold war, and that's become an internationally polarizing figure.

Speaker 1:          21:00          He's been strong and unapologetic in his foreign policy and use of force and questions while they're around his treatments of political opponents and critical Journalists. Putin, he's unwilling to sit back, be a shrinking violet on the world stage, ensuring Russia remains a world power with a great deal of influence. He has done overtly, can't cultivate an image of strength both for Russia as a country and for himself personally, showing no signs of stopping is adventurous and dad have a lifestyle even as he enters his sixties. Vladimir putin, he has undoubtedly made a place for himself in world history and within eligible for reelection in 2018.
