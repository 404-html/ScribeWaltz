Christopher was the second child's where the sisters Zandra having been born in 1917 however, the marriage, it was not a happy one and it's when the boy was just four years old. His parents separated for the next two years.

Speaker 1:          01:37          The children lived with our style and Wengen Switzerland. While father remained in the Belgravia house often two years, the marriage officially ended. One in Switzerland are still enrolled. Her son in a preschool called Miss Fisher's academy, which was located in terror attacks. It was here that Christopher was given his first acting role appearing as the lead character in the play Rumpelstiltskin. In 1928 a stolen the children returned to England. Christopher was put into Agnes private school in Queen's gate. London in 1929 is still married a banker by the name of hardcore George, Syncrude. Rose Lee's step father happens to be the uncle of a young writer named Ian Fleming who would go on to create not only James Bonds but also bonds, arch nemesis, scaramanga or the man with the golden gun who would the would famously play on film a half century later following the marriage, the family moved to full on at the age of nine, Christopher was enrolled at summer fields, a boarding school in Oxford.

Speaker 1:          02:32          They enjoyed his time at some airfields and quickly made friends and proved himself to be a gifted and studious people. Among his closest friends at summer fields was Patrick McNee who would also carve a career as an axa and find fame as secret agents. John Steed in the Avengers, the ends, McKinney both enjoyed acting and it appeared in a number of school. Plays together some of the fields once a feeding school to Eton College and in 1935 Christopher sent the scholarship exam and was interviewed by the school. How are they as math disability let him down and he missed out on a scholarship by one place. If he was to attend eaten, his family would have to pay his way. Despite his mother's urgings, his stepfather was unwilling to foot the bill, so I ended up at Wellington College in Berkshire. It was at Wellington. There's lead proved himself to be a brilliant linguist. He mastered French, Spanish, Italian, and German, and he's gained a passing knowledge of Swedish, Greek, and Russian. Yet despite his academic prowess, he chafed under the harsh discipline that was meted out at the school. He hated the irregular parades and weapons training that became more and more regular as talk of war became more frequent in political circles. So it was with some relief that he had to leave Wellington when his stepfather went bankrupt in 1939

Speaker 1:          03:52          the 17 year old's education was over. It was now expected to make his own way in the worlds, but he entered the job markets just as the summer holidays were beginning and they wouldn't know prospects. After a month of fruitless job hunting, he was allowance to join his sister who was on holiday on the French Riviera. While there the heard news that the last public execution in France was to take place in Paris along with thousands of others. He took the trip to witness the grease from events from Paris. He traveled to mentor in Southern France. There he stayed with an exile Russian principally family with ties to his mother. He enjoyed his time there and wanted to stay, but with Europe about to erupt into warfare. It was decided that it would be better off back in the relative safety of London for a short time. He worked as a clinic and a shipping line office.

Speaker 1:          04:35          When war broke out in September of 1939 league was eager to do his part too young to join the regular army. He teamed up with some friends and traveled to Finland with plans to fight aside the fins in their struggle against Russia. The British teens may have had a lot of fighting spirit, but none of them knew how to ski, which rendered them virtually useless in the snow covered battles terrain. They were politely thanks for their assistance and then strongly encouraged to to returns to England back in London. Lee resumed his work as an office guy in 1940 at the age of 18 he joined the home guard. It was around this time that his father Jeffrey died, though we had great respect for his father's wartime endeavors. Christopher had no desire to follow his footsteps into the regular army knowing that conscription was not far away. He decided to enter the armed services on his times. Consequently, he volunteered to fight in the Royal Air Force

Speaker 1:          05:36          following his initial training. They were stations to southern Rhodesia on the brink of his first solo flying mission. He complains of blackouts and blurred vision. He was diagnosed with a failed optic nerve and told that he would never fly again for a number of months. He was transferred around the RAF service in Africa, but given nothing meaningful to do. Then out of frustration, he applied to ref intelligence service gaining entry to the service. He was posted as a water to the Salisbury prison in Rhodesia. From that he was moved to the Suez Canal zone where he was put to work and intelligence gathering activities during the north African campaign. He was deeply involved as part of number 260 Squadron Raf nearly losing his life when an airfield was destroyed by a German bombing rate in the winter of 1943 and he was part of an office swap and he was succonded to the army.

Speaker 1:          06:23          He spent the next year serving with the gawkers of the eighth Indian Infantry Division. He saw action in the battle of Monte Cassino almost losing his life when a plane crashed on takeoff. Towards the end of 1944 he was promoted to flight leftenants and it's posted to air force HQ when the ends of hostilities finally came in April of 1945 he was given a position in the central registry of war criminals of security suspects. He had become essentially a Nazi hunter. Her work was top secret and we have a few specifics about what he did in a later interview. However, he did see this. We were given dossiers of what they're done and told to find them, interrogate them as much as we could then hand them over to the appropriate authority. We saw these concentration camps. Some had been cleaned up, some are not.

Speaker 1:          07:18          They left the army in 1946 after what he had experienced over the previous few years. He could no longer bring himself to work in an office. You had the opportunity to teach classics at university, but didn't fancy that prospect either. Unsure what to make of his post military life. The 24 year old founders himself dining at the Italian embassy in London with his cousin, the Italian ambassador to England, Niccolo Karen Deni. Also if the Blue Karen Deni looked at me and said, have you ever thought of being an actor taking a little off guard by this? Be Replies, no way, don't think so. Karen Deany then replies, perhaps when you go away you might want to think about it. Let's think about it. He did. He decided that he quite likes the idea and mentioned it to his mother. The Countess has, however, was vehemently opposed. A career in acting was beneath this status.

Speaker 1:          08:05          She implored and besides it six feet, five he was too tall. It was also to foreign looking and it was hardly a steady line of work, but the more she railed against the acting idea, the more her son became determined to make a success of it. Towards the end of 1946 he joins the rank of company of Youth and the next few years he busied himself learning the craft of acting. He swept to the first stage [inaudible] prompts cards for the actors on the stage and eventually got tiny parts himself. Then came small roles in films. It's high. Did indeed work against him with casting directors struggling to find a place fan. However, the roles did come. Director's managed to find creative ways to hide his height such as having him sit during his scenes. Some of his roles in these early years where and creditors, while others ended up on the cutting room floor, but they all added to the skills that he would display when the big roles eventually came around.

Speaker 1:          09:07          In 1957 Lee was hired by hammer film productions for his biggest part, yet he was to play the monster created by Baron von Frankenstein, who was to be played by his good friend Peter Cushing. The movie goals of a castle of Frankenstein founds any immediate audience among the lovers of horror who clamored for more hammer decided to satisfy the demand with a cinematic take on the Bram Stoker Classic Dracula with the d and the lead role. The movie released in 1958 was a huge hit within these sinister, yes charming take on the fanged account forever embedding itself in the Public Consciousness Dracula. That was the movie that turns the struggling 36 year old journeyman actor into a star he laid to recalls. It's brought me a name, a fan club, and a secondhand car for all of which I was grateful. The Dracula movie was both a blessing and a curse.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Philly. It's inevitably at typecast him and tied him to a peer and a succession of sequels, each one worse than the last. When he tried to bring the series to an ends, he was in his own words, black males by hammer executives who would remind him how many people and he would put out on the street if the next movie it was not made. Lee Played The parts of Dracula 10 times and increasingly grew tired of the shadow that it cost over is Korea. It took eight years for the Second Dracula to be released. By which time the first movie had made a tremendous impact all over the world. Yes, when Lee was handed the script for the SQL, he was horrified, not spoiling the murderous things that his character was asked to do, but by the terrible dialogue that he had been given. As a result, he refused to do the lines, which is why Dracula does not say a single word. In 1965 is Dracula prince of darkness, and he was also concerned that the character of Dracula, it was getting further and further away from water. Bram stoker had in mind when he wrote the book.

Speaker 1:          11:02          According to the man himself, Lee's real career as a serious actor started when he was cast as the mucky to sad and a tale of two cities in 1958 this was in fact his 43rd movie. Other the serious roles follows, but he was unable to escape the horror genre for over a decade. Appearing in a slew of largely forgettable blood and guts flicks both for hammer studios and other production companies. In 1962 Leo auditioned for a role in the World War II. You classic the longest date. It is ironic that despite his distinguished service for his country during the actual war, he was turned down because it was felt that audiences wouldn't accept him as a military type from 1965 until 1969 leave, despite his obvious English bearing start in a series of movies in which he played the villainess Oriental Fu Manchu. His skill as an accident along with long hours in the makeup chair allows him to breathe life into the role of the criminal masterminds.

Speaker 1:          11:56          In 1917 Lee picks up a single day's work as the narrator in a film about the market you decide in titled Eugenie. It was only when the movie was released that he realized he was appearing in a soft porn film loaded with sex scenes that were shot when he wasn't around. He was embarrassed and he was angry, but he couldn't really do much about it. Leed credits his role as Sherlock Holmes is smarter older brother Minecraft in the 1970s movie, the private life of Sherlock Holmes as the role that allows him to finally break free from being typecast as the horror guy. Three years later, he played Lord Summer Aisle in what is considered the best movie ever made that wicker man, but he was so taken with the book of well upon which the movie is based that he offered his services free of charge. The film has become a cult classic and it is considered one of the best British movies ever made in the mid 1970 [inaudible] and Lee appeared as cob to rush for in the three musketeers and did sequel.

Speaker 1:          12:46          The four musketeers. During the fight scene, he received a knee injury which would play again for the rest of his life back in the early sixties Lee's stamp cards in the in Fleming who had made it big as an author but offered him the role of the villainous title character in the movie adaptation of is James Bond's novel. Doctor. No. Lee accepted the role on the spot. However, Fleming had and clearly with the producers and they had already chosen their man. It doesn't. Years later, they finally got his chance when he landed the role of Francisco Scaramanga in the 10th bond film, the man with the Golden Gun, Lee breathe life into this character as well, who Fleming had written as a rather bland bad guy lacking any real depth. The writer was delighted with the portrayal claiming that Lee had created the sinister counterpart to James Bond.

Speaker 1:          13:39          By 1977 Lee had established a reputation as a fine actor who could take on any role and to make it his own. Still. He was concerned that if he remains in England, he would eventually be lured back into the dark tunnel of horror movies. Avoiding that fate was the prime motivation for his move to the United States in 1977 his first American role, it was a departure from anything that had gone before the modern day disaster. Apple 77 the following year, he went even further beyond his comfort zone and appeared as the guest host on NBC live comedy show Saturday night live. He remembered the experience as the most terrifying hour and a half of his life that night though he impressed many people including budding director Steven Spielberg, who promptly signed him up for his next project, the period comedy in 1941 they had the chance to follow up with another comedy, a spoof of airports.

Speaker 1:          14:29          77 gold airplane. Bowtie turned the role down and do went to Leslie Nielsen. Lee would later refer to this decision as a big mistake through the 1980s and nineties near peers in a broad spectrum of movies, genres from dramas to comedies and even musicals. He also made regular appearances on the small screen for both British and American television audiences in 1998 and he was, controversially is Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan in the movie Jenna, it was to be his most demanding role and the one that carried the most responsibility for 10 weeks. He acted the part of the father of the Pakistani nation on location as thousands of local scrutinized his every move. The vast majority of them were won over by the consummate actor, amazed and delighted with his ability to become Gina.

Ah, it's best they would basically lists out a quiet grown with this revelation. The set went quiet.
