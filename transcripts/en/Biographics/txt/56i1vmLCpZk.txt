Speaker 1:          00:00          In the 1970s one six foot nine inch tall man named Edmund Kemper, towered over his peers and most considered him to be a gentle giant. No one in his life could have imagined that he would murder six teenage girls hitchhiking through Santa Cruz, California, or that he would finally turn his rage on his own. Mother, no one in campus life have a got any bad vibes. Cindy didn't show him any signs that there was anything wrong, actually bad, a genius level Iq ends. He was the kind of person you could imagine having a fascinating conversation with over a cup of coffee. He was so likable indeed that no one would have ever guessed that he could be capable of killing a total of 10 people and defiling their corpses. He covered his tracks so thoroughly that he would never have been caught either until he picked up a pay phone and turned himself in. Today on biographics, we're talking about gentlemen Dicamba, the coed killer.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Edelman's Kemper was born in 1948 in Burbank, California. He was a very sensitive and intelligent boy. Like many families at that time. Ed's parents raised chickens and grew their own vegetables in the backyard as idolized his father and he loved to spend time with the chickens and the other farm animals as if they were as pets. He gave them all names and played games with them in the backyard. His mother was always quick to reprimands and discipline him, so he was always a very well behaved child. He has two sisters, one older and one younger who received more love and attention from them about that. Ed was still in primary school when it's fall of the chops to have the chickens heads off in front of him. Later, of course, his mother would cook for birds for dinner. When you refuse to eat is pat says herons challenge and the same over at the dining table, forcing him to eat the chicken through his tears that night he got on his bike and he wrote as far away as he could, but he would find that there was no escape.

Speaker 1:          01:59          His father would slowly force him to get over his sensitivity of watching animals killed. As time went on, he grew numb to the blood and the headings and he learned to accept it. This is just a part of life adds. Later went on to kill a cat. He couldn't understand why the adults in his life were telling him the killing farm animals was acceptable, but killing a dog or a cat with symphony, not his parents got a divorce when he was nine years old, but his mother was so bitter that she began to take all of our hatred out on Ed. She's ads that all men were worthless and she began to treat add far worse than his sisters simply because he was a boy. She moved to Montana and she got remarried. The second marriage, it didn't work out. He threatens his mother went through a string of boyfriends that never lost it very long as a male role model, as a child being raised by now, single mother, they did not have a lot of toys, so they would use their imagination instead.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Add rattled lots of books from the library and is included in his reading horrific stories from history, from the vikings to the Holocaust. He suggested that he and his younger sisters could play a game called of a gas chamber. They tied each other up in a chair just to see you get themselves out of the bondage the quickest, pretending that they were stuck in a room that was filling up with deadly gas is another insist is had bedrooms upstairs and Edwin's had slept in a bedroom upstairs as well, but his mother decided to move his bedroom down to the basement. She was convinced that he would hurt his sisters instead of a bad, he have to sleep on a cot where the sleeping bag with only a single light bulb hanging from a string. It was damp, cold and frightening with only the rats to keep him company at night. According to him, he interpreted that his mother has a deeper meaning behind our actions. He said, why am I going to the basement? I'm going to hell that going to heaven.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Ed was incredibly tall for his age, so everyone assumes that he was older than he actually was. He started driving when he was only 10 years old. This was totally illegal of course, but his mother must have allowed him to use the family car. One day he drove himself to a carnival and there was an attraction where people could slide their head into a real guillotine and pretend to have the heads cut off and soar. It has a strange contradiction that people were laughing and squealing and the face of death just for the thrill of it, even though it was all just pretends. Ed Kemper, he got excited and found himself wishing that it was actually real. It was in this moment and that is delusions began to get far worse and he actually began having difficulty deciphering what was real and what was fantasy. A 13 years old life at home with his mother became so toxic that he ran away from home to try and live with his father runs his new step mother in Los Angeles, but the reunion, which only last a couple of months because he sent ed to live with his parents on there, 17 acre farm.

Speaker 1:          04:43          His grandparents lived in a remote and occasion on the top of a mountain surrounded by their massive farm farmlands. He was completely isolated from the outside world. Yeah. His grandmother was just as domineering and abusive as his mother and his grandfather. You have dementia since they lived on so much lands, his grandparents were to allow him to use a rifle to hunt rabbits, squirrels, and raccoons. His grandmother would carry the guns with her whenever she left the house for a year and a half, things were going fine until edge. Went back to see his mother for the first time in almost two years, she knew exactly which buttons to press to make them feel worthless. Being around his mother triggered his delusions to come back and any progress he made and his mental health. It was lost. Upon returning to his grandparents' farm, he slipped back into a delusional mental state.

Speaker 1:          05:26          He presented to leave the house and then he shot his grandmother in the back of the head with his rifle. Then he killed his grandfather saying this. He did not want him to live through the pain of knowing that his wife was murdered during a later interview at Camp said, but it was a good thing that he was so isolated from society on the farm because he was so angry at the world in that moment that he knows he would have become a mass murderer when his delusion was over reality set in and they'd sore. His grandparents were bleeding on the floor. He could've driven far away from the scene and no one would have known about their deaths for an incredibly long time. But the first thing he did was called his mother. He told her what had happened and she told him to call the sheriff and turn himself in. So he did. When police showed up to arrest him, he went willingly. When he was asked for an explanation, he owns it. I wanted to see what it would be like to kill grandma

Speaker 1:          06:20          since he was 15 when he killed his grandparents said, can put, was still considered a minor and he went to a mental hospital without having to serve any jail time. Doctors gave him multiple tests and they discovered that he had a genius level Iq and he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and can put, hey actually love living at the hospital because he was finally getting the help that he so deeply needed. He took the proper medication and there was a lot of structure and stability in his life, his mind, it began to heal and he was fully in touch with reality for the first time in a long time. He was even given a job shadowing one of the doctors because they believed that he could get better runs, that he would still have a bright future ahead of him. This meant he was able to remain calm and give the answers that the doctors wanted to hear.

Speaker 1:          07:02          When they interviewed him, they weren't convinced that he had made a full recovery and they set him free. After four years while he was in custody, he told his doctors all about the abuse that he had endured from his mother as a child and he begged for them not to send him back to live with that. It's doctors promised him that this would not happen and they agreed that living with her were there any mannequins mental health was, but the judge ultimately have the final say and he bought, had Camba back into his mother's custody. Now that he was a full grown adults, he grew to be a six foot nine inch tall man. He was so huge this you have to dock in order to get into a room. He spent his childhood being raised by conservative adults since all of his teenage years were spent in a mental hospital so that Ken Burns, he was shocked to be thrust into the free love movement and the Hippie Cultural Revolution that was happening in California.

Speaker 1:          07:49          He felt very awkward and uncomfortable and could barely hold a conversation with a girl. He was 21 years old when he first went out on a date. He took a girl to Denny's and a John Wayne Movie Bus and all felt incredibly awkward. He didn't smoke, party, didn't listen to music or go to parties like most kids of his age. In the 1960s and seventies his mother had raised him saying that all men were awful people and she worked at the University of California Santa Cruz with female students. In many ways. His mother was a third wave feminists to truly did despise men. Having this shoved in his face on a regular basis made Kemper project is hate towards his mother, onto other women. He had fantasies about being with women, but he didn't have fantasies about being in a relationship.

Speaker 1:          08:35          It's kind of been decided that he wanted to become a police officer because there was a lot of structure and order in that profession and it would be a good and steady job. Oddly enough, there wasn't. His juvenile record that stopped him from becoming an officer is rac ought had been expunged, so it was as if fitted never happened at all. It was actually his height that stopped him since there was a limit on how tall a police officer be. He decided that if he couldn't get a job as an officer, he still wanted to be friends with cops and he started hanging out with the police that have arc or the jury room. He founds a job for the California highway departments after getting out of prison and for a short while he had his own apartment since and independence in life away from his mother, but when he fell into financial hardship, he was stuck living with her again.

Speaker 1:          09:14          They would often get into intense arguments that made the situation worse on a daily basis at drove and drove and drove. He took out by habits of picking up hitchhikers and giving them rides. This was very common back in the 1960s and seventies and college students held up signs saying the location of where they wanted to go in his mind. Yet this fantasy of killing a young woman that he would pick up, he would practice picking up both men and FEMA hitchhikers and letting them go free. He did this over 150 times just as practice runs, say that he could feel prepared for any scenario at the bar. He was listening very closely to what police officers were saying about their new cases and they mentioned the facts and this teenage girls runaway over time. I need to show up sometime later. In his mind, he was living out a fantasy where he would pick up a girl so that he could rape and murder her.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Through all of these practice conversations, he figured out what to do in order to make people feel more at ease. He also concocted a plan to drop a chap stick into the passenger door so of his victims trying to escape. They could no longer open the door from the inside. His fantasy was finally realized on May the seventh 1972 when you picked up to 18 year old girls named Mary and Pascoe and Anita New Chasa are in Berkeley, California. They asked for a ride to Stanford University. He drove them to a secluded area in the woods and locked in eater in the trunk. He stabbed, strangled Maryann before opening the trunk and killing a needs in the same way. Often they would dad, you raped them and stuff that bodies into the trunk of his Ford Galaxy on the drive home. A police officer pulled him over. He was able to remain calm as if nothing has happened.

Speaker 1:          10:44          The officer told him that his tail light was out and he went on his way. He laid to dismembered their bodies, put them into bags and dumped these bags, models, pause in order to throw the police off. Universities in the local area began to tell the students not to accept rides from strangers. They also told everyone that if they had no choice but to accept a ride to only get into cars with a campus sticker on it. Ironically, as Canva actually did have one of these stickers from UC Santa Cruz since his mother worked for the college on September the 14th 1972 he picked up a 15 year old girl named Eiko Coo who needed a ride to a ballet class and he kills her in the same fashion. On January the seventh of 1973 he killed Cyndi shawl instead of disposing of Cindy's remains like he had done with the others.

Speaker 1:          11:24          He buried in the yard facing towards his mother's bedroom window. Cindy's had was actually sitting in the trunk of his car when he went to his state mandated therapy session. His psychiatrist was convinced that he was better and they released him from the court order to continue therapy even though he kills months apart. Ed Kemper continued to give rides to young women on a regular basis just so that he could get information about what the public was saying about him. These women were so unaware that had Kemper was a murderer, that they would even have a conversation with him about this coed killer speculating about his motivations. He would hang out at the jury room, bars up, learn new information about the case. He also wants you to a lot of crime shows on TV in order to understand every possible way that they might catch up to him.

Speaker 1:          12:05          For example, he had the edge to go to the funerals of his victims and pay his respects, especially when he sold the detectives, so waste drop to the funeral of a homicide victim. He knew not to give in to these natural impulses. On February the fifth 1973 you got us into a very intense argument with his mother and he went out and killed two more girls, the Thorpe and Alison Lube. He finally made the connection that the anger he felt towards his mother was the trigger that set him off on this killing spree. He knew that if he wanted the killings to stop, he would need to kill his mother, but this plan would be put on hold. When the police showed up at the camp, the residents

Speaker 1:          12:44          a few days on the, yeah, the police received a tip that Ed Canva had purchased a gun, the Chopin who could see that his personal record had been expunged and that he had committed a murder when he was under 18 the shop owner reported it to the police and gave them add Kemper's name and address. When the police showed up, they recognized Ed Kemper from the boss, so they assured him that it was just a formality and led them to his closet where he kept several guns. Sitting next to those weapons was a woman's pennys into box filled with mementos from his victims, but for the police officers took notice. He quickly distracted them and led them out to his car where he had more hidden weapons. They did not suspect him of being the murderer, but he was very paranoid and he was convinced that they were onto him for an entire week.

Speaker 1:          13:22          He plant his mother's murder. When she came home, it was late and night and edge Kemper [inaudible] stumbled through the front door at four o'clock in the morning. It was at this point that he smashed her head in with a Claw Hammer, even decapitated her sexually violated her face and ripped out of vocal chords, shoving them in the garbage disposal. Then he placed her head on the mantle piece and started throwing dancer [inaudible]. When his rage subsided, he realized that he had to make it look like a breakin. Otherwise the police might suspect him. He called up his mother's best friend, Sally hairless, and said that he had made a dinner for them both. When she arrived, he strangled her. He then stuffed their bodies into a closet and left a note for the police. After killing his mother, the torment stops. He packed his bags and drove far, far away.

Speaker 1:          14:02          He was able to actually start speaking to women without fantasizing about killing them because the source of his anger, it was gone, but he realized he couldn't live with the guilt any longer and he actually wanted to stop hiding and pay for his crimes. If found the nearest payphone to call and confess that he was the coed killer, he waited patiently there for them to arrive on the ride back. He gave the police officer's every little detail of his crimes and the police officer's felt sick from listening to him, but he was in custody at that openly admitted that he could not control these delusions that had taken over his mind. He begged for a lobotomy so that he never had the urge to kill anyone. Never again. That's, that never happens. He was sentenced to 10 counts of first degree murder. He is still alive today that he's currently spending life in prison and his time behind bars.

Speaker 1:          14:48          He has shown a sense of remorse for his crimes and he gladly assisted in the research on the psychology of serial killers only agreeing to video into audio interviews. He also began to teach classes and computer literacy to fellow inmates and he has since spoken very eloquently mean has even started reading audio books for the blind since he was always so polite and on his best behavior. He was allowed to leave prison and to live in a reform hospital. Psychiatrist. See, listen to the tapes of Ed camp, but describing his life. Believe that his mother must have had borderline personality disorder or it's, if it were not for all of the abuse that he endured, he would never have become a serial killer. Other say that he was just born a sociopath and that killing it meant nothing to him. They believe that any sign of guilt or remorse is simply just for show because it was so good at studying real human emotion.

Speaker 1:          15:33          No matter what the truth behind Ed camp, his mental state may be, none of it justifies what happened to his victims and it will never bring back the lives of the women that he kills. If we can learn anything from the story of Ed Kemper, it's that we never truly know what goes on inside the minds of the people that we see every day. You just might never know that that kind man next door, there's a serial killer, so I really hope you enjoyed the video.
