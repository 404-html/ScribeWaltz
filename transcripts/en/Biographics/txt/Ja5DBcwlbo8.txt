Speaker 1:          00:00          His computer generated voice has become familiar to generations of people instantly garnering recognition as the words of a genius. His name is answered in the same breath as Einstein and Galileo and he had a few people can understand the complexities of his theories. What they do know though is that Stephen Hawking overcame physical obstacles that would have defeated many people and he did that in order to pursue his passions. In the process, he became an inspiration to millions and added greatly to our understanding of the universe. In this week's biographics, we undertake a brief history of Stephen Hawking and just before we get started with the video to that, do you want to say it but it's brought to you by the great courses plus the great courses plus is an on demand video learning service has got lectures from top Ivy League professors as well as experts from other places like the Smithsonian National Geographic excetera. It's like a university education, but at your own pace. There are no tests, no schedules, and it's incredibly easy to access.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Steven William Hawking was born at the height of the Second World War on January the eighth 1842 in Oxford, England. It was exactly 300 years after the death of the father of astronomy. Galileo Galilei. Both of his parents were graduates of Oxford University. There's father frank was a medical researcher while his mother Isabel worked as a medical research secretary. They were a middle class family with both parents being thought of in their community as rather old brain boxes. Steven began his schooling at Byron. How School? Then high gate, the school used a new progressive method of teaching to which Steven did not take. He stayed here for three years though and by the age of eight he could still not read at the war's end. Frank was offered a job at the National Institute of Medical Research and the family moved to St Albans. Yeah. Frank wanted his son to attend the prestigious Westminster School.

Speaker 1:          02:16          How are the, Steven was sick on the day of the entrance exam and he ended up going to nearby St Albans school instead. Steven at this school he was seen as a nerdy outcast. He was small and skinny and he spoke with a list but that made it hard to understand what he was saying. For the first two years of his time there, he was very much a loner. In the third year, he managed to find a small group of like minded friends that are extra curricular activities included going on long bike rides and didn't venting board games. Steven, he proved to be the most inventive and creative of this group and we'd come up with the rules and organize the state of play in these games. Steven has two younger sisters and a brother who was adopted in 1955 however it is. Parents showed little interest in domestic affairs.

Speaker 1:          03:02          The walking, the house was filled with books and the parents were too busy feeding their minds. Often reading books during dinner rather than conversing with their children. Steven regularly had his friends over where they would busy themselves building model planes and electronic devices. From about the age of 12 onwards, that discussions extended from science to religion. They debated the big questions of life among themselves and it was at this time that Steven began forming his atheistic beliefs. Stephen's teachers, they soon identified a remarkable talent for mathematics and physics in him. He seems to intuitively know the answers without having to work through the problem. By the age of 14 he knew that he wanted to specialize in physics. He felt that he could provide an insight into the big questions that he and his friends had been grappling with. Where are we in a row from why we are here and where we're going?

Speaker 1:          04:01          At the age of 17 Stephen felt ready to take the entrance exam for university college at Oxford. The exam was extremely challenging consisting of five papers and the general knowledge exam. Walking came out with a score of 95% once again, the he found himself as an outsider at this prestigious place of learning. He had no friends and so he kept to himself. Furthermore, he found the lectures to be too basic for him, which they boredom. He stopped going to many of them and still easily pastors exams. The only lectures that he got any intellectual challenge from where those presented by his physics tutor, Robert Berman Hawking was well ahead of his fellow students despite being much younger than many of them. His knowledge was so advanced that he occasionally made corrections in the very textbooks that he was studying. At the end of his second year, he easily won the university physics prize.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Well, as Oxford, Stephen took up the sport of rowing. Rowing was and still is, a very serious business at Oxford University and Steven threw himself into it with complete commencements. He became a coxswain. The person who yells instructions to the rowers. He simply loved the thrill of going, doing his team to success. It was as involvement in the rowing team, which allowed Stevens a breakout of his isolation and develop some budding friendships. By the time that his old schoolmates from since albums turn diapers freshmen. They were surprised to discover that the awkward Biver they knew had become a confident young man who had found a comfortable niche for himself at Oxford. In fact, he became so immersed in the social life of his environment and that despite his innate ability, he began to fall back academically with his third year exams approaching. He quickly realized that he was not fully prepared.

Speaker 1:          05:42          He decided that his best about where's to focus solely on the theoretical problems that he could solve using his innate skill. The results of the exam had em teetering between a first and second class honors degree. He needed it to be first class in order to gain admittance to Cambridge where any plans to begin his work on his phd. The result depended on a final oral exam, which she haste gaining fest costs on us before heading off to Cambridge, Hawking's took a trip to Iran with the friends. He began Cambridge in October of 1962 while he had been expecting to work directly under the guidance of the famous astronomer Fred. How this was actually not to be the case. He was disappointed to find out that it's tuna was actually Dennis Schema. The reality of the situation was the, the organ was actually better off on the ski mom who had more time to go to students than Hoyle would have had hawking specialized in the study of cosmology. There was, now that he faced his first real intellectual challenge, he quickly realized that his mathematical knowledge was not deep enough for him to really get to grips with the complications of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

Speaker 1:          06:56          At about this time, hawking began to experience some physical abnormalities. His speech was starting to slur and he was prone to losing his balance when he returns home for the 1962 Christmas holidays. His parents were so concerned that they sent him to a specialist. A series of tests were undertaken and then it was simply a matter of waiting for the results. In the meantime, hawking attended in New Year's Eve party where he met a young lady by the name of Jane Wilde. Jane who was attracted to the eccentric? Yeah, intellectual and the two struck up an immediate attraction. Steven had already returned to Cambridge when the results of the test came through. He had developed a als which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a condition in which the body's cells to generate causing paralysis and muscle atrophy. Yes. While the body deteriorates, the brain is unaffected, so hawking now at the prospect of being trapped within a dysfunctional body.

Speaker 1:          07:51          The prognosis related to hawking was that he had just two years to live. The symptoms that he experienced and the first few months were weakness. Stammering while speaking and having trouble swallowing. Hawking later reflected on his feelings at the time, a disease which can never be hills. I'm in the clutches of the disease which is calling me closer to my death. The thought itself used to bring cramps or fear in the stomach. Why have I only then caught by Jess disease? Stephen's doctors and his parents advised him to continue his studies at Cambridge. They believe that staying focused on the goal of achieving his phd would help him to cope with the pain and frustration of dealing with this failing body, but Hawkings struggled with the idea that he was working so hard for a reward that he would probably not live to receive. What was the points is the question that kept dancing around in the back of his brain.

Speaker 1:          08:43          It has been reported that hawking fell into a deep depression at this time. He was spending his days drinking and listening to Wagner and a student flats. However, the man himself actually later denied this a session. He certainly went into a period of confusion and lack of focus, but he also did his best to continue with the studies. After a year, his symptoms had stabilized and his spirits began to pick up. It was also this time that he picked up his relationship with Jane Wilde. He became a great supporter and encourager of him. It was she who gave him a glimmer of hope for a brighter future. The two became engaged in October of 1964 Jane had committed herself to looking after Steven for the rest of his life, and they were married on July the 14th 1965 after two years of living with the disease, hawking was able to get around on a cane. Though this speech was becoming increasingly unintelligible, he was still searching for an area of focus for his thesis. Fred Hoyle, who is just pronounced his theories on the discovery of the universe, and hawking believed the coils theory was flawed, and he publicly challenged these theories. He then proceeded to write his thesis on the topic, and it was well received by the cosmology community. It was this that really established talking as a player of note in the field

Speaker 1:          10:01          after graduating from Cambridge with a phd in Applied Mathematics and theoretical physics applied for and received a fellowship. It's Cambridge is gone, villain keys college. This provided him with a secure job, which gave him further confidence in his future. Yes, his condition had now reached the stage where he could no longer. Right. So he had to rely on Jane to record his thoughts. Hawkings job at the college required him to supervise students for a few hours every day, providing him with plenty of time to pursue his research studies. He and Jane set up that home and a small house not far from the college. They enjoyed entertaining friends and the house was often filled with dinner guests. In December of 1965 hawking was invited to the United States to give an address or to Miami conference. However, his speech was so slurred that a friend had to read the address on his behalf.

Speaker 1:          10:48          The speech, though it was well received. Further cementing is growing reputation as an exciting new thinker in the world of cosmology. Mom Jane spends a lot of time and effort caring for her husbands. She had given up on our own career when the couple have had maths. She was in the midst of a degree in modern languages. She completed that degree in 1967 that year. She also gave birth to their first child. Robert. Two more children would follow Blue Lucy in 1970 and Timothy in 1979 the birth of his first child was a further motivated for Hawkings. He look positively toward the future despite the fact that he's already outlived his initial prognosis. He had a family now along with a promising career is a budding genius. In fact, some were even already calling him the success at Einstein.

Speaker 2:          11:30          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:36          the turning points in Hawking's Korea. Cause when he attended a lecture by mathematician Robert Penn rose in the address, Penrose expounded his theory of space time singularity in the center of a black hole. Okay. Latched on to the pen, raised singularity theory and applied it to the entire universe. If he could prove the mathematics behind it, he knew that this would be a momentous addition. Do you the understanding of the origins of the universe mathematics was hawking strong points. So he collaborated with Penrose who presented his calculations by way of visual representations in order to help hawking who was unable to recall the calculations himself. The Big Bang theory was predicated on the idea that the universe was not static, but actually it continually expanding. According to this theory, the universe began as a black hole. It was held together by gravity, Viagra at the center of the holy. It was extremely hot and does it cooled over billions of years. It started to expand with the protons, neutrons and electrons forming the stars and the galaxies which make up our visible universe. Hawking. He was not the originator of this new theory, but his work such as the essay singularities and the geometry of space time gave it a strong underpinning.

Speaker 1:          12:54          By the ends of the 1960s Hawking's, als had deteriorated to the point where he had become wheelchair bound. The intense speed of his mental cognition, however, caused him to move around with maximum speed in its we'll chat. It also caused him to quickly become impatient and irritable with those around him. Despite his raw temperaments, IEM actually became very popular with students and colleagues alike and the early 1970s hogging took on the task of reconciling the two opposing theories that had divided physics for years. Quantum mechanics and relativity. During his work, he discovered that black holes in it, radiation. He published this finding in an article in nature magazine. There was initially some push back to this, but eventually his finding was accepted. Then that came to be known as hawking radiation. The discovery of black hole radiation was a big deal and it led to publicity beyond the scientific community.

Speaker 1:          13:47          Working with now receiving general media attention giving rise to the fame, which would see him lauded as the wheelchair genius. In 1973 hawking published his first book, the large scale structure of space time. The following year or read 32 he became one of the youngest people to become a member of the Royal Society in 1974 B with salsa. We invited to spend a year at the California Institute of Technology. Yeah. He was able to make use of the very best equipment, including the jet propulsion laboratory that is attached to the institute during his year in America. He was able to work alongside famous American theoretical physicist, kept thorn. The Hawkins family thoroughly enjoyed their year in Sunny California. Over the years. Steven would frequently return to Caltech to make you sit there advanced facilities. At the end of that time in the u s the family returned to Cambridge. Where have they moved into a bigger house on the college grounds.

Speaker 1:          14:40          In 1976 the students in residents by the name of Don page joins the hawking households. Paige would walk walking to this office every morning and perform other caretaking jobs. Around this time, Jane began to feel confined by her life as a mother and a wife to a wheel chair, bound husbands with page now on hand to help out with Steven's Kashi embarks upon a phd in medieval Spanish poetry. Once she gained did, she began teaching at Cambridge University. The couple began experiencing marital problems from the mid 1970s one cause of their discord was the wildly divergent religious views that each health Jane was a committed Christian welp Steven. He was a confirmed atheist. The relationship remained strained until the divorce in 1995 in 1976 or hawking was invited to a number of conferences around the United States following which he ended up on TV. Talk shows though his speech was difficult to understand.

Speaker 1:          15:36          He did prove hips with American audiences. In 1979 hawking was appointed Lucchese and professor of mathematics at Cambridge. This position brought great prestige with the couple now being the center of the Cambridge social elite. Hawking enjoyed attending concerts and movies and despite his physical limitations, he was enjoying his life more than ever before. Still, he became disappointed at the back of facilities for handicapped people in the community and became an advocate for disabled facilities. In 1983 a BBC horizon documentary gave TV viewers and insight into the private life of the wheelchair genius. This went a long way in promoting his celebrity status. In 1984 he put out several feelers to publishing houses to write a definitive book of his theories for a lay audience. Bantam publishing offered him a $250,000 advance. It took four years. Do you produce the book, which is called a brief history of time.

Speaker 1:          16:29          It became an instant best seller and to date has sold more than 10 million copies. In July of 1985 hawking was in Geneva when he found himself unable to breathe. After arriving in the hospital, he underwent tracheotomy surgery. The surgery. It was a success, but the payoff was that he lost his voice. The challenge was now how to provide hawking with a way to communicate with the world, and this was solved by a computer programmer by the name of Walt. Walt halls has equalizer program allowed hawking to select words from a screen that would then be converted into a voice synthesizer

Speaker 1:          17:11          from the early 1980s onwards or walking had employed fulltime nurses by the end of the decade. He had become alarmingly close to one of them. A woman by the name of Alain Mason. She was a woman with a dominant since protective personality in early 1990 hawking told Jane that he was leaving the family home and moving in with Elaine Mason with herself, married to a family friend at that time, Hawking Institute of divorce proceedings to officially end his marriage to Jane. When the divorce came through in 1995 he and Elaine were married in the ensuing years that were rumors that Elaine was physically controlling and abusive to her husband's. After 11 years, the marriage ended in autobiography. Hawking referred to you his years with Elaine as passionate and tempestuous. In the 1990s hawking became interested in time travel. He was of the opinion that the only possible way for time travel to exist would be if it did not alter the status quo.

Speaker 1:          18:05          In other words, if a time travel machine could be created in the future, people would only be able to travel back until the time when that machine was created because prior to that time, the machine did not exist. Many people, they rejected Hawkings ideas on time travel and in order to prove his point in an irreverent way, he decided to hold a party, which was I even do anyone and serve free food and champagne. The catch was that he only advertise the events after it had occurred. So only time travelers would be aware of it. Um, surprisingly though no one turns up and the early two thousands hawking focused on publishing more popular books starting with 2000 and one's the universe in a nutshell. And in 2005 he put out a brief history of time, both of which were best sellers by then his iconic status. It was well established to being cemented with appearances on the Simpsons and star Trek. The next generation.

Speaker 1:          19:03          By 2005 Hawkings condition had deteriorated to the extent that he could only control his speech controls with movements of his cheek muscles. From 2009 he could no longer move his electric wheelchair himself and his breathing became increasingly difficult. The end came peacefully on the morning of March the 14th 2018 it was the 139th anniversary of the birth of Albert Einstein. The Stephen Hawking was a professor at one of the best universities in the world since he was a man who shared his knowledge with the world through books that can be understood by everyday folks and that's why I'm particularly pleased that the great courses plus is involved with today's video on their learning platform. You can learn from Ivy League professors and others as they give lectures online. These can be a great way to learn about some of the concepts that hawking works on, infusing lectures about black holes and quantum physics, but there's also plenty of other stuff on there from history to travel to help.

Speaker 1:          19:59          Basically it's really a university education, but it's at your own pace with no tests and no schedules and it's also very easy to access. You can do it on your PC, on your tablet, even on your phone. They've even recently added streaming so you can listen on the move. Something I particularly love, I just pop the audio in when I'm walking around or going for a jog. And on the platform there are currently 10,000 lectures that you can choose from. So yeah, it's all great stuff and the best way to find that out is to try for yourself. And you can do that for free by going to the great courses plus.com forward slash biographics or simply clicking the link in the description below. And doing that does help support this show getting more biographics out to you every week. So again, the great courses plus, it's just a great way to expand your knowledge on a whole range of subjects taught by the in the wells. And as always, I really hope you enjoyed the video.
