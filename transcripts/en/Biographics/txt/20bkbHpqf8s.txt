Only now, six years after his death, are we able to piece together a complete profile of the life and death of the man at the forefront of a violence, political movements that significantly impacted our worlds. And this week's biographics, we discover the truth about a summer bin Ladin

Speaker 1:          00:55          that's all in the bin. Ladin was born into a wealthy industrialist family in the city of radar. In 1957 his father, Mohammed bin Laden, was a builder and contractor who during his lifetime had 11 wives and at least 52 children. His mother was a petite Syrian women. Muhammad was an ambitious businessmen who had brought his family from Yemen to Saudi Arabia in the hopes of both advancing his own professional opportunities and providing opportunities for his son's things while they went well and the elder bin.

As he became more successful, Mohammed further strengthened his bond with the Saudi royal family. He used his money and influence Steve Bolster the image of the House of south in risen.

Speaker 1:          01:50          King Faisal decreed that all the nations construction contracts would be awarded to the bin. Ladin Corporation. Mom had been lodged and well, he died in a plane crash in 1967 the 10 year old a Sama was told at the time by king five sal that today I have lost my right hand, the construction corporation. It was then taken over by a summer's older brothers back in mid 1990s it was worth an extraordinary $36 billion the summer. He was then Greens to enter the family business after successfully completing high school with he further his education at King Abdulaziz University that he studied economics and management with an eye to a future in business. He also learns the behind the scenes dynamics of the family enterprise. Unlike a summer, most of his brothers chose to attend western universities where they were not constricted by Islamic tradition. This was particularly true with the Samas half-brother Saleem known for his good looks and discharge. Psyllium was educated in London and flew his own private plane in the late 1970s Isama now in his mid teens began to enjoy the excesses of wealth. He would regularly make the trip to Beirut Lebanon to take in the excitement of the city is fast paced nightlife. He spent hours frequenting nightclubs in casinos and often drank more than he should have. He also began enjoying the company of beautiful young women

Speaker 1:          03:16          around 1975 however, Osama bin Laden had a spiritual rebirth causing him to return to Islam with a third and devotion that altered his goals and lifestyle drastically it again when he decided to help with restoration work on t mosques. At the same time he began meeting with Islamic fundamentalists and reading more about the teachings of Islam. Within weeks he had disowned his former Luke's way of life and to become a devout Muslim. At the age of 20 assault, my entered an arranged marriage with a devout Syrian woman who was a distant cousin. Together they immerse themselves in Islamic fundamentalism, rejecting Western values and priorities and condemning it's greatest proponents of the United States. When Saudi Arabia, king five sal was killed by his derange nephew, been lardons anti American sentiments. They were reinforced. The king's nephew had been educated in the United States and to become a complete the westernized bid laws, and he was thrilled.

Speaker 1:          04:10          In 1979 when a fundamentalist religious leader known as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran who was seen as a puppet. For the United States. For the first time, Islamic fundamentalists so seized a Muslim country and established and Islamic state. Each gave undeniable proof that radical Islamic forces could prevail over Western decadence c. Then towards the end of 1979 the Soviet Union invaded the largely Muslim nation of Afghanistan, Soviet forces. They were ruthless pouring overwhelming fire power onto the Afghanistani resistance. They could also the president of Afghanistan and put their own governments in place. Middle Eastern Arab nations. They want understandably alarmed by this. They were all sympathetic to the Afghani cause, but knew that none of them had the ability to take on the Soviet war machine. Yet Islamic fundamentalists militants were determined to do something. Then I was doing the Soviets and restoring Islam in its purest sense, fit that definition of jihad or holy war. Thousands of young men by Islam rather than national boundaries traveled to Afghanistan to risk their lives for their beliefs. Among them was a Somac been modern. Wow.

Speaker 1:          05:28          The savings, the invasion of Afghanistan. It was the impetus that took a Sama bin Ladin out of his comfortable life of privilege and into his reincarnation. As a freedom fighter? Yes, yes. Unlike many others, he did not unthinkingly grab an AK 47 and rush off to the desert to join the guerrilla army. His first stop, it was in Pakistan where he set up a recruitment station to bring Muslims from surrounding Arab nations to the cause of jihad. It seemed, became a clear that his business backgrounds and money, we're going to be eight huge assets. He organized to training camps where the recruits learns the art of Strategic Warfare Been Mosin. It knew that the thousands of eager young men he was gathering together and needed a support network, so he also began recruiting doctors, bomb experts, military strategists and engineers from all over the Arab wells is families building backgrounds impelled him to build the infrastructure that would be needed to defeat the Soviets.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Many would come to fight sooner. It found themselves digging trenches, paving roads and it's building hospitals and depots. During the 1980s binladin was instrumental in bringing together in Afghanistan Nan's nearby areas of Pakistan, more than 25,000 Muslim fighters from at least 35 countries around them as live well's. Yet support also came from the most unlikely places. The United States. The U S was fixated on stopping Soviet expansion and so we're willing to support Islamic efforts to remove the communist invaders from Afghanistan despite their hatred of the United States. That jihadists, they gladly accepted they're backing after all. It meant money, weapons and suppliers. Still they made sure that America state well clear of their operations. One Islamic intelligence officer noted that no American instructor was ever involved in giving training on any kinds of weapon or equipment to the merger has been or how you fight it's been laws on.

Speaker 1:          07:12          It was instrumental in securing it from the United States. Stingers, which way? Heat seeking ground to air missiles with the ability to bring down a Soviet fighter plane with the aid of American Stinger's been lardons men could bring down at least 270 aircraft through their fixation on defeating the Soviet spy, whatever means necessary. Vus. They were creating a monster as well as bringing money, resources, and organizational skills or the jihadist cause they didn't. Martin, he fought alongside his fellow jihadists. One of his trips recalls he was a hero to us because he was on the front line always moving ahead of everybody else. He not only gave us money, but he also gave us himself. He came down from his palace to live with the Afghan peasants and the Arab fighters he cooked with them, ate with them, dug trenches with them. That was bin Ladin this way. Ben Loves him. He was not afraid of death, can fence. There was a special place in the hereafter for those who participated in Jihad. Hey often stated that one day of fighting in Afghanistan was like a thousand days of praying and an ordinary mosque. As a result, he was more than willing to become a martyr for the cause.

Speaker 1:          08:27          In 1989 after a painful decade, the Soviets finally withdrew from Afghanistan. Osama bin Ladin Return Saudi Arabia with the reputation of jihadist heroic. He was hugely popular among the common people and the ruling families or friendship with him as a way to quell a criticism from Islamic fundamentalists who saw them as two western been laws and well, he milked his hero status for absolutely everything it was worth. He spoke a mosques and other places often drawing large crowds of young men who were inspired to help create an Islamic fundamentalist world. His speeches filled with venom against the United States were often tapes with over a million copies circulating around the Muslim world display. Returning to the rich embrace of his family. The summit did not avail himself of the lavish lifestyle that was available to him. He moved into a modest apartment with his wife and children and did his best to live according to the strict teachings of Islam and yes, there was a fire still smoldering inside of him that far.

Speaker 1:          09:20          It was inflamed in 1990 when Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein invaded the neighboring nation of Kuwait with Saudi Arabia looking to be his next target panic. It rose in Saudi Arabia. Well been, wasn't he stepped up? It's, he offered his assistance. His experience in Afghanistan had allowed him to map out a battle strategy that would be able to save his country. He was determined to that any Iraqi aggression be mass by Muslim forces alone. It's cool on the West for help would be he argued contrary to Islamic teaching and demoralizing to the nation bin. Ladin warns the Saudi government that assistance from the u s would mean that Islamic fundamentalists would withdraw support, but Saudi Arabia as minister of Defense, Prince Sultan knew that even been lardons forces could not defend this country from the air, naval and chemical attacks as well as biological weapons that Saddam Hussein, how did this disposal on one occasion been lots and even burst into the principal's office and yells, there is no need for American troops.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Yes, we're in the prince asked him how he could save the people from an hierarchy, chemical weapon attack. You could only reply. We will defeat them with our faith. The Saudi government is rather and surprising and he did turn to the United States for help. The results was the Gulf War. The US led western assault on Iraq. Saddam was pushed back until negate it. However, the outrage of bin Ladin is fundamentalist followers. US military forces remained in the region in case the dog made any further aggressive moves. The House of Saudi he would not long before seen association with Bin Ladin as an asset. I've got nervous at a Samas hero status and huge popularity they wanted to to restrain him from making negative public comments about their reliance on the west, threatening to remove the lucrative public contracts that had made his family so wealthy.

Speaker 2:          11:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:08          The relationship between [inaudible] and the house of Saudi, it quickly deteriorated to the point that in 1991 but he was expelled from the country. Three years later, his citizenship was revoked. He fled to sit down with his immediate family, which now included three wives and 15 children. They moved into a brick and stucco home in Khartoum where he lived a simple and deeply religious life in Sudan, been mods and quickly found support for his ideology, which was fiercely opposed to any collaboration with the West. His goal was to overthrow regimes that were friendly to the u s and establish in that place true Islamic states. The first step towards that end would be to strike at a u s targets throughout the world. By doing so, it was believed that the United States would be forced to withdraw from the Middle East. Even the governments that had been propped up or by could easily be toppled.

Speaker 1:          11:55          The nucleus of the terrorist organization that would bring about these changes was a group that bin Ladin helps develop and as you might know it, it was called al Qaida from their base in Sudan. Experienced al Qaeda leaders were sent to various parts of the world where there were large Muslim populations. Their mission was to incite and Islamic revolution and carry out acts of terrorism and his first year in Sudan, they love him. He became a disciple of Hassan Abdallah to Robbie, the Islamic spiritual leader of Sudan. Wasy Robbie helps a sama to deepen his spiritual development, been Larson in turn built up to Robbie's jihadist group Greek, the popular international organization or P I own. He also builds connections with various international finance institutions to channel money towards his growing terror networks. At the same time he could smuggle terrorists into the United States by arranging for them to be employees of companies that were owned by wealthy pro Islamic Middle East and businessmen. Meanwhile, Mincey dawn been laws and established a building company known as the owl Hirafu construction developments limited. Its sole purpose was to build an infrastructure in Sudan to move the equipment, vehicles and weaponry needed to expedite terrorist acts

Speaker 1:          13:12          by the mid 1990s bit laws in an established a worldwide reputation as a revolutionary with thousands of young jihadists idolizing him and dreaming of being just like him. The first bombing attack that was credited to been large and was the December 29th, 1992 attack on two hotels in Arden, Yemen. Both hotels were frequented by US military personnel in the area. Three people were killed and five more were wounded in the attack. This was part of a concerted efforts to oust the Americans from the Horn of Africa and assert fundamentalist Islam power in the region. The focus of the action was in Somalia where bin Laden organized fierce fighting against US forces who were there for humanitarian purposes, been laws and counted the withdrawal of US troops from Mogadishu as among his most significant victories against the u s then following his actions in Somalia Been Ladin turned his attention to Europe is first step was to bolster the Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Balkins.

Speaker 1:          14:05          Before setting his sights on Western Europe and the United States Muslim communities in these places, wet saturated with pro Islamic anti western propaganda been laws in also relied heavily on email and the Internet to get the word out. In 1995 Alica eater turned its attention back to the Middle Eastern nations, but if the leaved where roadblocks to the establishment of Islamic fundamentalist regimes throughout the Muslim world, but London saw Egypt and Saudi Arabia as the two biggest obstacles to his course in Saudi Arabia, he became obsessed with overthrowing the house of salt. In November of 1995 he orchestrated the bombing of a u s military training center in Riyadh killing seven people, thousands of south. They were outraged at the attack, convinced the bin. Ladin was behind it. A few days after the attack for mercenaries from Yemen opens fire with Ak 40 sevens outside of his residence in Sudan, bin Laden's bodyguards returns firing within minutes.

Speaker 1:          14:57          Three of the assailants and two bodyguards with debt from that day on some of the bin Laden's House and street were transformed into an armed camp. It wasn't just the house of salad that we're offering though. In 1996 a US special forces operation was launched to capture bin Laden with the aid of American friendly Muslim nations. From then on, he refused to venture out of C. Dot. But then both Saudi Arabia and the u s turned up the screws threatening economic sanctions on the Sudan unless they handed the nodding over. He was quickly asked to leave and he and his wife and children edit for Afghanistan in May of 1996 safely ensconced in Afghanistan. [inaudible] now fully embraced the role of international leader of the Islamic extremist movements just stay alive though me just surround himself with many body guards. He established a three room operations space in a cave that had been carved out to the side of a mountain that was equipped with basic furnishings, is only connections to the outside world where it's satellite phone and two laptops. Then in 1998 been lots turn internists, destructive attention back to Africa. It's plan was the bomb two US embassies in different African countries would always the seventh simultaneous attacks in Kenya and Tanzania kills hundreds of people. Although he denied responsibility. The international community where unanimous, that's bin Ladin was behind the attacks. As a result of the u s stepped up its attempts to take him out with an air strike on October the 20th known as Operation Infinite reach. It destroyed it. Three terrorist training camps in the Afghani mountains, but bin Ladin, he remained at large.

Speaker 1:          16:35          A year later, he was connected to an attack on the u s Navy destroyer, USS Cole. There should that stop to refuel in the port of od in Yemen when the terrorists blasted this killing 17 sailors less than a month after that two planes smashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. In New York city striking a devastating blow with the very symbol of American business and achievement. Within moments, it had been transformed into a full blown war zone. About 45 minutes later, the terror struck again a high drag down our liner that it departed from Virginia with spear headed into the Pentagon, the nation's military headquarters, the horrific, shocking attack. The deadliest since Pearl Harbor was a major wake up call for the United States, or $25 million reward was offered for bin Laden and anti terrorist task forces were set up despite a full on effort to bring him to justice. Bin Laden was able to remain at large plotting further attacks for another decade. Sometime in the mid two thousands he slipped into Pakistan for a while and he stayed in rural mountain villages protected by local tribal leaders. He then moved to the bottom bad compounds with three of his wives. He now at five and 13 of his children and it was that that the Americans finally got them. Yeah.
