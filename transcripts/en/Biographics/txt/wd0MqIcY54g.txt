And then with the Nazi regime crumbling around him, you simply disappeared. What did he and this week's bond graphics, we take a look at the life and the disappearance of Heinrich Muller.

Speaker 1:          00:51          I'd recommended was born to Catholic parents in Munich, Germany on April the 28th, 1900.

He was awarded the Iron Cross first and second class while serving on the western front after sustaining a leg injury in a plane accident. He was awarded the retired Bavarians badge is mental whole during his short period of service. Also included the Bavarian military cross second class with swords. It was quite an accomplishment for an 18 year old

Speaker 1:          01:53          after leaving the German army, Miller founds employment as a junior assistant for the Munich police force. After a period of time, he passed his entrance exam to become a police officer by now. He had reached his full height at five foot seven inches tall and he had a strong athletic builds and Willa kept his dark brown hair cropped very short on the sides. He had a small mouth and was rarely seemed to smile. While his extremely intense day, I would often a nerve those in his company. The first world war injury voted ended. His war, Korea caused him to walk with a constant level. Will have married a girl named Sophie Dictionary in Nineteen Twenty Four. Sophie's father was the publisher of a right wing newspaper room, was opposed to the new National Socialist Party and its leader at of Hitler. Mila was to stick to his faith throughout his career, despite the Nazi parties antipathy towards the church three years into the marriage, his son reinhard was born.

Speaker 1:          02:42          The marriage was to last for some 30 years with the second child, girl named Elizabeth. Born on September the ninth, 1936. The child was said to be not quite right, which led to a strain in the marriage. Subsequently engaged in an affair with his private secretary, Barbara Hellmouth and the marriage. It was essentially over over a 10 year period, mother rose in the ranks to become police secretary in 1929 by now. He was serving in the section six of the Bavarian state police. This unit was mainly concerned with seeking out and keeping a lid on communist activity in and around Munich. By the time he had reached the age of 30, Mila had to become a rabid anticommunist. Thanks. In part to his having been a witness to communist hostage murders during the Bavarian state republic during the German revolution of 1918 to 1919, his energetic performance of his duties and willingness to follow orders without question earmarked him as a man with a future in the new Germany during his service with the Bavarian state police mother ran in circles that included Nazi leaders, Reinhardt, Heidrick, and Heinrich Himmler. However, this time mullah no doubt under the influence of his father in law was decidedly anti Nazi when the Nazis overthrew the Bavarian government on March the ninth, 19, 33. Well, it was in favor of picking up arms to actively resist hitless forces

Speaker 1:          04:07          with the barrier and its police force under the control of the Nazis will approved to be a valuable asset for the new regime. Has Knowledge of communist activities, but in high demands and t advanced in rank to become a criminal investigator. In November of 1933, he was a bit of a workaholic and exhibited a high degree of self discipline and ruthlessness. His early experiences in the army had instilled in him they military compliance to orders that was highly appreciated by the Nazi leaders, is natural antipathy towards the Nazi party capital from becoming a member until he was compelled to do so in 1930, nine years earlier, referred to Hitler as an immigrant unemployed house painter. As a result of his auntie nancy sentiments. He was kept under constant surveillance by the party in 1937 report referred to him as ruthless and continually tries to demonstrate his efficiency but claims all the glory for himself.

Speaker 1:          04:58          However, the truth of the Iraqi security office Reinhardt Heidrick, so a lack of blind devotion to the Nazi party. There's an asset he was increasingly impressed by Mala having kept a close eye on his police career in mullet. He saw a man who was completely focused on the minute detail of his job description without a concern for the bigger picture. From 1933 onward, began doing work for the Nazi party under the direction of Heidrick. He would be given accounts and reports detailing Nazi atrocities and turns them into dry administrative reports. In 1934, he joined the secret service or the SS in 1933 when Hitler became chancellor of Germany, Hermann goring, Hitler's second in command became interior minister of Russia. This button in commands of the largest police force in Germany. Guerin created the Gestapo by amalgamating the various branches of the Prussian police forces. The name was an abbreviation of gooey Hina, starts Palencia or secret police.

Speaker 1:          05:58          On April the 20th, 19, 34 SS leader, Heinrich Himmler became head of the Gestapo. On that same day, Hitler appointed him chief of police for all states apart from Prussia two days days up him that handed the leadership of the Gestapo to Reinhardt Heidrick, who still retained his position as head of the SS. On June the 17th, 1936 hipper appointed him as chief of old German police, including those in Prussia. This movie gave him low operational control over all of Germany's detective forces. The Gestapo had now become a national agency as opposed to simply a Prussian state agency. Endless even created the criminal police or criminal police, merging it with the Gestapo to form the CFO or secret police, heidrick retains control, making Heinrich Muller and his operational chief in the wake of Hipaa. Nineteen 38 onslaughts of Austria. Mila was also made inspector of security police for Australia.

Speaker 1:          07:01          It was Miller who gave the orders that resulted in the arrest of up to 30,000 Jews on the night of November the ninth to the 10th, 1938, a date that history remembers as the Kristallnacht or the night of broken glass as a subordinate of Heidrick. He also did most of the administrative work in preparing for the immigration of all Jews from Europe under the auspices of the central office for Jewish emigration. Three years later on September the 27th, 19, 39, the security and police agencies all over the country were brought together to form the right name, security office or R, m s a, which was under the control of Heidrick. The Gestapo was now officially department for of the RMS RMSC, heinrich muller. He was named the Gestapo chief will have finally joined the Nazi party in November of 1939 after being pressured to do you say by Heidrick. From this time onward, he became known as Gestapo Miller to differentiate him from another Nazi official who bowl the same name.

Speaker 1:          08:10          On August the 11th, 19, 39. Adult fitness stated the following to the League of Nations High Commissioner. If that is the slightest provocation, I will shatter Poland without warning and just so many pieces that there will be nothing left to pick up. What he needed. Next was that provocation which will allow him to unleashes war machine and set the world on the road to war to create it. He turned to the Gestapo as a result, heidrick and works together to bring about the Polish provocation that Hitler had warned about. The plot to create the reuse of a Polish propagation was called Operation Tannenberg. They decided to create a series of fake border attacks in which Germans living on the Polish border would be the victims of attacks by Polish insurgents literate. Heidrick settled on the border area near the town of Grievance. Yeah. Well, situated, isolated German outposts that would make logical targets for attack.

Speaker 1:          09:05          It was decided that fake attacks would be made on a forestry station, a customs house, and a radio station. SS soldiers were recruited into the scheme and dressed as petition surgeons and as Polish army personnel. More SS troops were then clad in German army uniforms. A last minute touched to the plan was that some of the polls would be killed in the attack so that their bodies can be presented to the welds. Media concentration camp inmates were brought into play. The part of these poles who were about to be put to death operation Tannenberg was stationed to go into action at 4:30 AM on August the 26th. Then we're to be three successive code words and the various units. Where do you cross the border? Once the last code word was issued after the release of the second code word, some units became confused and headed for the border prematurely, but then he changed his mind.

Speaker 1:          09:55          The attack would be delayed. Mental motorbikes were sent out to bring back the attacking fake polls. Hitler held back because of British guarantees. Deponent, after consultation with Heidrick and Mila, it was decided that the plan would be revised. It was also felt that a real Polish insurgent would be needed so that he could be put to death and paraded to the world's newspapers, Melissa, through his files and came up with the name of Franz [inaudible], who was a prominent Polish sympathizer on August the 30th, Melissa, and his men to pick up on the Iraq. The attacks were carried out on the evening of August, the 31st starting at 8:00 PM. A drug, friends, honey alk was dragged out and propped up against the radio station entrance. It was then shot in the head. Photos were taken and delivered back to mother and Heidrick, but they were deemed as not being good enough to be used for media propaganda purposes. Still, the fake attacks serve that purpose. The following day, September the first 19, 39 adult Hitler referred to them as justification for his attack on the Poland. Two days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany and the Second World War was underway.

Speaker 1:          11:04          Heinrich Muller was now in charge of the most ruthless arm of the Nazi party. His brief was to stamp out all manner of oppression to the regime he immediately set about in his methodically efficient manner, so you create an instrument of state sponsored terror. The Gestapo were given the job of investigating every act of treason, espionage, and sabotage perpetrated against the state law that had been passed in 1936, gave them free reign to operate without any restraints. This law gave the organization exemption from any responsibility to the administrative courts so long as the Gestapo were acting in harmony with the will of the Nazi leadership than they weren't acting lawfully. The aspects of the Gestapo is activities that was most open to abuse was called the soft, which translates to protective custody. It gave them the authority to imprison anyone without having gone through any court proceedings.

Speaker 1:          11:56          As a result, thousands of people were beaten mercilessly with many of them simply disappearing. This gave the Gestapo a fearsome reputation throughout the labs. Fear in fact became the gestapos greatest weapon. Mila was a highly skilled interrogated himself. He would draw interrogations out for hours on end is making full use of his incredible memory to trip up his subjects. We only have one surviving accounts of an interrogation conducted by Moda, his opening words to his subjects, a British officer where you are in the hands of the Gestapo. Don't imagine that we shall show you the slightest consideration with the onset of war. The Gestapo numbers web bolstered substantially by 1942. Mother was in charge of around 46,000 offices as German conquest. It's mounted the operations of the Gestapo extended to occupied territories. Its duties were extended to putting down resistance movements. To do this effectively with only 46,000 men will have cultivated the perception among the population that the state was constantly watching, that nobody was safe.

Speaker 1:          13:02          The miss sight of like a staff, a unit would instill terror in people. The general feeling was that if you did anything against the Nazi stage, the Gestapo, they would eventually track you down and then your life simply wouldn't be worth living. In order to cultivate the fear that was needed to control the people, I was happy to leak the details of the sorts of torture that his underlings were inflicting upon those taken into custody. The more gruesome the story, the better. He also organized for the occasional show trials to be held in public where the People's court would vehemently denounced, convict, and then condemn a prisoner to the firing squad. Mother's favorite people's got judge was the notorious redlands fries. They're the custodian, had offices at every concentration camp. Personnel from the Gestapo were also used to make up the Einsatzgruppen or death squad. Suit carried out mass killings.

Speaker 1:          13:59          The Gestapo were largely responsible for putting into action hitless plan for the elimination of the Jewish people from Europe. To accomplish this, the office of resettlement native to become the office of Jewish affairs was created. It was headed by adult Eichmann who was Miller's immediate subordinate. Together the two men implemented a mass, deportation and exterminations that Nazi concentration camps throughout occupied Europe. On march the second 19, 44 signs the infamous bullets decree which ordered that escaped allied prisoners were to be transported to the meth house in Goossen concentration camp and summarily executed. This was in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention in the wake of the July, the 20th, 1944 plot to kill Hitler. It was Miller who authorized the use of torture to interrogate those involved in fact his zeal in the aftermath of the attack and in the knight's cross to the war service with swords under his oversight, more than 7,000 people were arrested with 4,980 either committing suicide or being executed. Mullins duties included overseeing counter espionage operations between 1942 and 1945. These were focused on the Soviet Union. Much success was achieved in feeding false information to the Russians and even in turning a number of Soviet agents.

Speaker 1:          15:22          Well, it may have never been a dyed in the wool Nazi, but he believed the German victory was inevitable. Even in the last days. He thought that a final German victory in the den could turn the tide of the war as the Russians and the Americans closed in on Berlin in April of 1945. Below was among those secrets in the underground bunker that was now home to the rep in the final days to discover that Hermann goring had secretly undertaken peace negotiation with the allies enraged the Phyrra ordered Miller to interrogate Waffen ss general an about what? A new of gatherings, underhanded dealings. This interrogation, his last official duty resulted in the execution of felon on April the 30th that'll fella and his wife Eva Braun, committed suicide the next day. May. The first molar was quoted by Hitler's personal pilot is saying we know are some methods exactly. I haven't the faintest intention of being taken prisoner by the Russians that evening have disappeared from the bunker. Just happened to. It remains one of the great mysteries of the Nazi era. For almost 70 years, he remains the most senior Nazi official to remain unaccounted. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          16:36          On June the 18th, 1945, the allied counter intelligence war rim released a statement that concluded that it seems clear from most reports that molo remained in Berlin after the collapse over the next few weeks, several high ranking Gestapo officers were arrested, but the man at the head of the terror organization was nowhere to be found with Heinrich Muller being a common German name. The ally has found many molars but never the right one. This led to many false alerts and frustrating dead ends, so the United States counter intelligence services were determined to keep tracking down. There were reports that he had taken on the name of Schwartz or Schwartzer and traveled south in the company of a fellow Gestapo officer, but this ended up as yet another dead end. By the mid 19 forties, the general consensus was that Heinrich Muller had died.

Speaker 1:          17:29          The dramatic may 19, 60 capture of adults come in by. The Israelis reawakened interest in the search for the Nazis in general and Heinrich Muller in particular. I commit himself, added to the interest by stating at his trial that he was of the opinion that Mona was still alive in July 19, 60. The West German police were brought in to open an into motos whereabouts it was suspected that wherever he was little I was corresponding with his family, former secretary or mistress. All of the things people were therefore put under surveillance. The West Germans developed three major leads in the case, each one confirming the belief that he had met his end in Berlin in 1945. This eventually led to the exclamation of a grave in a cemetery in West Berlin despite the fact that the gravestone read our loving father, Heinrich Mila born April the 28th, 1900, died in Berlin, may 19, 45.

Speaker 1:          18:20          The grave did not contain Mila's body. The American CIA began to such familiar. It's around the same time as this west German investigation. It was prompted by the defection of a Polish intelligence officer who reveals information about a handful of escaped Nazis, including the defects are informed, the CIA that Miller had been taken into custody by the Soviets and was working in Moscow. In counter intelligence, the CIA attempted to corroborate the Polish defect is inflammation with limited success throughout the remainder of the 19 sixties that were various reports of my love living in South American countries such as Argentina or Chile. Still no concrete needs emerge though. Finally, in 2013, it appeared that conclusive evidence that emerged proving that Heinrich Muller did in fact, Diane Berlin in 1945 research on the part of the memorial for German resistance concluded that he was buried in a mass grave with around 2,400 other people in Berlin.

Speaker 1:          19:16          The conclusion is based on a report of a barrier commander which detailed to the discovery of the body complete with Mona's military identification papers in his pocket, so it would appear that the most elusive of the Nazi hierarchy, it's not simply the new of after role.
