Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's the 21st century, how would Hughes, John D Rockefeller and Steve Jobs all rolled into one dynamic package. His hunger for global change mirrors the sense of adventure of the great explorers of the past is ideas considered crazy by everyone around him have opens up a new frontiers as he continues to improve the welds with the aid of technological advancement. His goal to make the earth a better place to live on has expanded to encompass the entire universe, including the possibility of supporting human life on Mars and this episode of Biographics, we get up close and personal with the man who was the model for Marvel's iron man movie franchise character Tony Stark. Of course, the man we're talking about and must be Elon Musk.

Speaker 1:          00:58          They little mosque was born on June the 28th of 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. His Canadian born mother was a dietician with his father being a mechanical and electrical engineer. The boy has a natural leaning towards technology buying his first computer, a commodore Vic 20 with money. He had saved 20 it was just 10 years old. By the age of 12 he had created his own video game blaster, which he sold for $500 as a preteen, had already taught himself computer programming. Musk's life came to a crossroads in his late teens when he was faced with compulsory military service in South Africa. While he had no problem with the thought of serving his country in uniform, he was repulsed by the idea of being a part of a system that suppressed the country's indigenous black people. His desire was to get to America the land of opportunity, especially in regards to his growing fascination with all things related to computer technology to do so. However, he figured he would have to use Canada as a stepping stone. His mother, it was still a Canadian citizen and so steps were taken for Elon to acquire Canadian citizenship for himself.

Speaker 2:          02:00          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:07          After graduating from Pretoria boys high school and the emigrated to Canada in June of 1989 age just 17 he had hardly any money, men's new real connections turning up on the doorsteps of distant relatives of his mother and to being put to work on their farm, as well as tending vegetables and shoveling grain. He got a job at a lumber mill, cleaning out boilers. Then he managed to secure a job as an intern, Clark. It's a local bank. In 1990 he moved to Kingston, Ontario, where he began the science degree at the Queen's University. Two years later, he was able to achieve his goal of living in the United States, transferring his studies to the University of Pennsylvania. Within that two more years, he graduated with double degrees in science and business. It was around this time that must came across a copy of Douglas Adams, his book, hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

Speaker 1:          02:52          The book revolves around a supercomputer which is built to figure out the ultimate answer to the question of life, the universe, and after 7.5 million years of computing, it spits out the onset, the number 42 along with that onset, the computer which can talk, add some sage advice telling the inquirer. The problem with you, to be quite honest with you is that you never really know what the question is for mosque reading. That was a light bulb moment. He later recalled is highlighters and important points, which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer. Why the time he emerged from university. MUSC wasn't entirely sure what the questions were, but he knew that they were tied up in three key areas. The Internet, clean energy, and the outer space. In 1995 MUSC enrolled himself in a phd program for Energy Physics at Stanford University. Yes. After an attendance of just two days, he decided to drop out in order to launch his first business. His love for physics. It never wavered, but he saw greater opportunities in the burgeoning internet revolution or waiting to make society better and himself rich shot.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Mosque realized that as more and more companies established an online presence, they would need to have that printed materials converted into digital documents. If he could fill that need, he would be onto a winner. Ilan teamed up with his younger brother, Kimbal team develop content publishing software design for news and media companies at a time when many venture capitalists, so it never even heard of the Internet. It's was a major risk. The products that the mosque brothers came up with, well, that was called Zip two. It started life as a tool that would help people to search for maps and directions on the Internet with people. Also being able to post information through something similar to a micro blogging system, things that were tough for mask in these early days. He had no money, not even enough to rent an office and an apartment at the same time.

Speaker 1:          04:50          So in order to combat this, he rented an office where he slept on a futon and took care of his personal hygiene down with the local y starting with small newspapers. Moscow was able to quickly grow his client base agreements were made with large media companies including the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times in order to allow those companies to use zip to, to make their content readily available to readers via the Internet. The program was used by many similar companies along with ecommerce sites as a platform for their web presence. By 1999 visit to corporation was providing web hosting, web development and maintenance services for close to 200 websites. They came to the attention of the online city guide citysearch who were interested in a merger. This deal, it didn't work out, but another one did often just four years of operation. The Zip to cooperation with sold to Compaq computers for $307 million in cash and to further 34 million in stock options.

Speaker 2:          05:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:55          At the age of just 28 Elon Musk, he was a multimillionaire, but he was just getting started. And even before the ink was dry on the zip to deal, he had thrown himself into his next venture and that was x.com Musk's vision was to create the world's first online bank and he invested $10 million to kick it off. The goal is to offer every service that you had gas from a conventional bank, but with the added benefit that you could send and receive money securely using only your email address. x.com was an immediate success. After just a year of operation. It was merged with a money transfer system called infinity. The combined businesses were renamed paypal in 2001 now working with confederacy founders, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin. The business dropped the idea of a fully functional online bank and focused on the feature that seemed to grab everyone's attention, the ability to send money to and from anyone who had the same app.

Speaker 1:          06:47          At this early stage. The system, it relied on a windows based handheld device. During the first months of the merger from January, 1999 through October of 2000 Musk was CEO of [inaudible] dot com during this time, he set up this viral system that grew it into the world's largest email payment processor and new customers. They were offered a $20 cash cards along with an additional $10 for referring a friends within two months. More than a hundred thousand new customers had come on board, but not always well within the company's management. The problem was Musk's management style, which can best be described as dictatorial, both feel unloved and found it difficult to work with them. They were especially frustrated. It doesn't need to micromanage everything, just need sands divisions of rose over which technologies to use and how to brand and the company. As a result of such divisions. Thiel ends Levchin organized a coup against CEO Musk. When he was meeting with prospective customers overseas. He returns to the country to discover that he had been fired, the CEO by the board and replaced by Peter Teal. Shortly thereafter. The name of the company was changed to paypal and this time with a second capital p. From that it grew exponentially leading to a buyout by Ebay in 2002 the cost of the sale was a staggering one point $5 billion. As the largest shareholder, Musk walked away with a cool $165 million.

Speaker 2:          08:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:13          Even before people were sold, Musk was onto his next business venture. Ever since he was a child, he had been fascinated by space exploration. He had always been an avid science fiction reader bands. Now we had the money to turn science fiction into reality. He was convinced that the earth was destined to collapse as a life sustaining planet. The sooner we started working on the technology required for interplanetary travel and sustaining life beyond earth, the better. In discussions with a friend one day, Musk complains that despite the vast improvements in the technology industry, the space industry has lagged. Got For behinds. Since man had set foot on the moon way back in 1969 it's a peer to him, but no meaningful progress had been made. He was determined to change that and his third company space exploration or space x was to be his platform to do it.

Speaker 1:          08:59          A major goal of space x is to create a space vehicle that can take people, equipment and other necessary resources to Mars and builds a transportation infrastructure that will allow humans to become a multiplanetary species. When Moscot loves the world in on his vision, he was immediately subjected to ridicule industry experts, dismissed him as a rich board playboy claiming that his physics degree in previous business ventures, I'll be made him qualified. Do you conceptualize, develop and build rockets? However, they were underestimating mosque who was not only a quick study, but who also brought on board the best engineers from top aerospace companies such as Boeing, Twa and NASA Musk. He was disappointed that NASA seems disinterested in space exploration. He wants it to peak the public's interest in order to encourage NASA to increase their allocated funds to a project to land the device on Mars and then build a bubble by over us.

Speaker 1:          09:49          He also wanted to introduce a cheaper and safer alternative to space shuttle travel. He was struck by the fact that the Russians were able to produce rockets that were cheaper and safer than anything that the Americans could come out with. He traveled to Russia in an attempt to, to purchase a refurbished ICBM, but the deal became too complicated. MUSC next set his sights on creating and successfully launching a reusable rocket, which he called a Falcon one. The idea was that it could fly off to space, return to Earth, and then we launched back to space again. The first scheduled launch for Falcon one was in 2005 yeah, three years later after multiple failed attempts. How can one, we're still to have its first successful flight. Finally, on its fourth attempt, Falcon one successfully launched on the back of this success. Space x was able to secure a one point $6 billion contract from NASA involving 12 for future flights on their rocket. Falcon nine to the International Space Station at Musc is estimated that space x is efforts can minimize the u s government's expenses by around $1 billion every year.

Speaker 2:          10:57          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Musk has always been fascinated by cars and specifically by the dream of creating a breed of electric cars that totally transform the driving experience. While he was still a sophomore at university, he had become aware of the wells depleting resources. What was needed was an alternative source of fuel, one that would not produce carbon emissions that were damaging the environment. It was from these ideas that Musk decided to pursue a electric cars or year after launching space acts. Musk was introduced to Al Chacone and Tom Gauge of AC propulsion, the company behinds and all electric con known as the t zero Musk was interested in mass producing the t zero but you konijn gauge showed no interest. They did however, introduce mask to a group of men who were dedicated to finding a more environmentally friendly vehicle. In July of 2003 Musk teamed up with three of them in rides, mock tarponing, Gans Martin Eberhard to form the for Tesla cooperation.

Speaker 1:          11:49          This company was named and recognition of the father of AC induction motors, Nikola Tesla. From the very beginning, Tesla faced an uphill battle. The contraceptive in electric car was years away from capturing the public attention and it's just as was the case with space x. The question was loudly asked how a visionary with no experience in the car industry could successfully establish a new company and a new product and stand against the industry giants. What's more they were attempting to do something that those industry giants, it's simply been unable to do. In fact, Robert [inaudible], CEO of General Motors stated that lithium ion technology for cars was at least 10 years into the future as a result of the lack of industry enthusiasm. Very few investors wanted anything to do with Tesla. In fact, Moscow to funds the majority of the operations of the company itself. The goal of having the furnace road stone rolling off the assembly line by 2007 never materialized as costs just continued to mouse just as with x.com years earlier, tensions arose among the management's mosque who was chairman of the board, has no faith in Martin Eberhard.

Speaker 1:          12:50          The presidents of the company. Before long they got her heart had been ousted and MUSC put himself in full control. He was now the CEO of two startups and even for a dynamo like Musk, this was still too much. It's still, but he had to make both companies work. His master plan at for Tesla was to build a luxury electric sportscar along with eight line of more affordable cars with electric power and zero emissions. In 2008 the first roadster was shipped out. This $110,000 electric sportscar could run for 200 miles on a single charge and was capable of going from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than four seconds. The more affordable electric car was called the Tesla model s it's released, began in June of 2012 sales took off and there are currently 500 rolling off the production line every week, as well as being the CEO of Tesla mosque is also the chairman of the board of directors of another environmental company, so the city will not the founder of this company.

Speaker 1:          13:43          He is very involved in achieving the company's mission to deliver complete solar energy systems, do the end users without any of the upfront fees. It also promised reduced utility bills for all of its customers by offering free installation and zero down payments to homeowners. MUSC has made it easier for consumers to afford solar energy and this revolutionized the way that the solar industry has run. So the city has enjoyed tremendous growth and success with clients that include Ebay, Walmart in the u s military. This has made it to the number one solar power service provider in the United States.

Speaker 1:          14:24          As it being an industry leader in space travel, electric cars and solar power is not enough. In August of 2013 MUSC proposed a completely new mode of personal transport. He called it the hyperloop. The concept will allow people to travel between large cities at the speed of sound allowing passengers to get from San Francisco to Los Angeles in about 30 minutes. It involves a vacuum sealed pod that rides on top of electromagnetic waves very simply. This is of similar to the way a surfer's board rides ocean waves. The partners will glide across the track at speeds of many hundreds of miles per hour. This eliminates the problem, the friction created by wheels on the tracks the same month that Musk unveiled plans for the hyperloop, the crown sourcing and collaboration platform. Jumpstart Fund was established comprised of more than a hundred engineers, developers, and investors. The creeps up on the hyperloop as their first project. In 2014 they formed a hyperloop transportation technologies and undertook a feasibility study.

Speaker 1:          15:21          In 2015 MUSC ran the student competition to design and build hyperloop pods. I space x sponsored mile long track was built in order to run the pods on. On July the 20th 2017 Musk announced that he had gained verbal government's approval to build a hyperloop track between New York City and to Washington d c Elon Musk is one guy who it is a challenge to keep up with. In the 12 months from December, 2015 to December, 2016 he still wanted it. No less than three companies open AI and not for profit. Artificial intelligence research company near Relink Cane, euro technology startup with the aim of integrating the human brain with AI and is the boring company which aims to bring down the cost of tunnel boring by 10 fold.

Speaker 2:          16:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:11          Elon Musk has been married two times. He met his first wife, Justine Wilson, while they were both students at Queen's University in Ontario. They tie the knots into thousands. Justine is a fantasy novelist who described her life with Elon as a dream lifestyle. There was empty at the court. Her husband was so focused on his work. That's even when he was at home, his mind, it didn't seem to be that the marriage ended in 2008 in a very messy public divorce in on and Justine have five children together, a set of twins and a set of triplets. Moscot met his second wife to do the Riley has a London nightclub. They were married just six weeks after he filed for divorce from Justine. The wedding took place. It's Skeeto Carlson in Scotland. He was 39 and she was 23 things apparently didn't go well with MUSC announcing their separation just two years later on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          16:55          It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever. You will make someone very happy. One day, the couple they got back together in 2014 but the divorce was finalized towards the end of 2016 when it comes to the future of Elon Musk, the best advice is to watch this space has never backed down from his ambition to travel to Mars, and it's possibly even retire there one day. Until that happens, we can be assured that he will continue to revolutionize the way that the world consumes energy benefits from technology and travels into space.
