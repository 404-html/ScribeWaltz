Speaker 2:          00:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22          Here's the only person who's baby picture was flown into space and whose body has been preserved for decades after his death. He pushed his version of communism so far and for so long that he was able to overthrow the governments of the largest country in the world. To some, he's a hero to others. He is one of the most evil villains in history and today's biographics graphics video. We're talking about Vladimir Lenin, the man behind the Bolshevik revolution and the founder of the Soviet Union

Speaker 1:          00:56          via was 1870 and Vladimir Ilyich, Oregon [inaudible] was born in a Russian provincial town called Sim bisque. He would later grew up to be known by his alias Vladimir Lenin. Am I going to explain that later in the video? Most revolutionaries, they've got this tragic backstory. If a young life of hardship rising from the lower classes to demand better treatments for the down trodden and many people are taught that this is the case with Lennon as well. They try to say that his parents were descended from surfs and theirs have to study hard to break into the middle class, but the truth is that then ins patterns, they were actually financially comfortable and by all accounts he had a happy childhood. His mother, Maria, she was descended from a wealthy Jewish family who is Swiss German, so she taught him French and German at home. His father was the director of public schools for the entire province.

Speaker 1:          01:45          They were considered to be hereditary nobility, yams. They were far more educated than the average Russian. This place does. Parents in a group cools the intelligentsia who would debate over philosophy and politics in their spare time. Many of the members of the intelligentsia became politicians. You helped shape the new laws of the nation while others devoted their life to pushing for a Russian revolution. Vladimir and his older brother, Alexander, they wouldn't no exception. His brother loves studying science in high school, but there were no opportunities to become a scientist in this small Russian village. So Alexandra and moved to Saint Petersburg to attend university. During this time, he joined a political study groupings. They began to discuss the failures of the Romanov Empire and they believe that the only way to say of Russia would be to remove them from power. When he was 21 years olds, Alexander joined a terrorist group who attempted to assassinate saw Nicholas the second with a homemade bomb, the terrorists, they were caught and Alexandra and his friends, they were hanged for that crime.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Vladimir Lenin was 17 at the time that his brother died and he was just about to graduate from high school. Even though we had gone through such a shocking tragedy, he still managed to become the Valedictorian of his graduating class. He went to law school with the intention of becoming a lawyer, but just a few months into his first semester, he joined the demonstration of students who were protesting against the school rules. Soon as the Russian police were already watching Lennon closely to see if he was also a terrorist like his brother. The school saw his participation in these demonstrations as a sign that he might cause a lot of trouble in the future, so he was expelled and he decided to educate himself instead.

Speaker 1:          03:25          The Song Nicholas, the seconds he released the peasant class from their surf status, meaning that they no longer have to be indentured servants to wealthy landowners. While this helps relieve the difficulties of a lot of people, it wasn't really a perfect solution to the problems that this hasn't passed. We're facing people. They were still in debt since many struggles to just make ends meet. The vast majority of people, they were illiterate and Russia was decades behind in progress compared to the western world. Many members of the intelligentsia, they were unhappy with the way things were going and wanted their country to move forward with progress just like the rest of the human race. Man. He studied Laura at school, but he realized that with his bad nerves and his family's bad reputation from his brother being a terrorist, it would be impossible for him to get a job as a lawyer.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Vladimir Lenin, he began his self education by reading Karl Marx and other revolutionary writers. He joined the Marxist Study Group were intellectuals, Matt and discussed philosophy and the possibility of a Russian revolution. It was around this time that a major famine spread throughout the lands near his home records of the 1891 famine. They vary drastically. Some say that the way 300,000 deaths, while others say it was closer to 5 million people, then he was fine. Of course it's family. They were well off as you had plenty of money to buy food, but he also didn't nothing to aid the people who were dying around him. He was actually kind of happy about this, saying that the worst things got in Russia, the better it would ultimately become. He knew that people needed to start dying in the thousands before people would be angry enough to want to revolution call Mark's right that he believes an industrialized society would be the most likely to create a revolution because he believes that they'd want to rise up against commercialism.

Speaker 1:          05:07          Vladimir Lenin rewrote a lot of what Mark's was actually saying. Lenin wrote the idea that the revolutionary intelligentsia will guide the uneducated peasants, even though the philosophy was labeled as Marxism all throughout the reign of the Soviet Union, it is now called Leninism because it really was his own personal ideas and not those of Karl Marx. Lenin joined a socialist group that gained access to a factory there. They started handing out fliers to factory workers. They weren't trying to make people angry about their work situations and wanted them to demand shorter hours and higher pay. They were caught though because they accidentally allowed a police informant joining the group and they were all arrested at this time, any form of revolutionary activity. It was taken very seriously and they all had to serve jail time. He was 26 years old at the time. You went to prison, but there was nothing like what weird.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Imagine a Russian prison to be. Since he descended from a Nobel blood line, he was given a very comfortable place to live where he could wear whatever clothes he wants, his as well as read books, and he also received a daily visits from his family and friends. He was even allowed to continue writing his revolutionary pamphlets and essays while he was behind bars for that very activity. After just 14 months in jail, he was exiled to Siberia for three more years. In a way though, this was actually a good move for him. He was given a government pension that covered his living expenses. This meant he spent most of his time meeting and writing about the revolution, which is what he would be doing anyway, so for him this time in Siberia, it was more like a very long writer's retreat and he was actually very productive during his time away.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Indeed, his girlfriend was also arrested and sent to Siberia as well. They got married there so that they could live in exile together. So Vladimir Lenin, he's raising these revolutionary ideas in Siberia and he's sending them back to a socialist friends who are publishing his essays in a secret newspaper. He made up a variety of different pen names so that it seems like multiple intellectuals were all pushing for the same revolution, but really it was just him. The bad name here eventually stuck with was Vladimir Lenin, which is what he is remembered us today after being released from his time at Exxon, he was 30 years old and he and his wife moved to Munich, Germany, where they could print revolutionary newspapers in Russian without getting into trouble with the German police. He would then have the papers smuggled into Russia with the help of fellow revolutionaries who carried them in their luggage.

Speaker 1:          07:21          One of these co-conspirators was a young man named Joseph Stalin who was equally passionate about the coming revolution and would eventually take Lennon's place. Now, just before we get into the next spot of Lennon's life, I do want to mention today's sponsor war thunder. Thunder is a realistic free to play vehicle combat game.

Speaker 1:          08:53          Rolling.

Speaker 2:          08:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:08          and most tellings of the Russian revolution. Vladimir London's rise to power always seems very straight forward. He is always depicted as a well-respected intellectual. He was able to rise to power or missed immediately, but that's pretty far from the truth has revolution. It was a long process, but he never gave up trying to sliver his way into a place of power. Vladimir Lenin, he had a real talent for stirring up trouble. Even among the intelligentsia, he would call anyone who disagreed with him. His enemies sends the sniveling bourgeoisie, even though they were all middle class socialists. He had absolutely no patience for anyone who did not agree with him, 100% during one of their meetings to discuss their strategies about the revolution. He insulted some of the Socialists so strongly that they got up and left while they were gone. He declared that his ideals were the Bolsheviks or the majority while everyone else was the Menshevik of Air Corps minority party.

Speaker 1:          10:00          That a Bolshevik get stock from that point on. So in 1904 let it, and he gets a bit stressed out from all of this debating and discussing his philosophy as well as handing out pamphlets and stuff like that. Since he got rather real, he decided to take it be a long hiking holiday and the Swiss Alps with his wife, but the Bolsheviks, they continued that own revolutionary work while he was gone in 1905 there was a peaceful protest in Saint Petersburg and front of the Winter Palace. People held up signs, pleading for better working conditions, all the ones, it was an eight hour work day. They even saying God saved the Sata show that love and support for the royal family, but instead of listening to their requests saw Nicholas the second ordered his guards to shoot at the crowd. Thousands of people died and it became known as bloody Sunday people.

Speaker 1:          10:42          They were outraged in the, began protesting for workers' rights all across Russia. When Lenin had the new c abruptly ended his vacation in Switzerland and decided to come back to Russia. He finally had the opportunity that had been waiting for. He began to preach to people that they needed to organize and take action against the sob. He got that little too excited about the idea of a bloody revolution and rotel. They should pour hot acid onto the royal gardens. Got into specific details of how to murder someone, which was something that no other revolution rewriter had done before. However, there was still not enough revolutionaries willing to fight and kill people on Lennon's behalf. Many of the Bolshevik revolution raise, they were exiled to Siberia and Lennon fled to Switzerland's before he could be arrested too. Then world war one rolls around and that basically puts a damper on everyone's a revolutionary plans.

Speaker 1:          11:29          Sonic lists. The second d left some Petersburg to join his man on the front lines. This all also left his wife Alexandra in the care of their spiritual advisor. Grigori rasp. Putin. Yep. Oh, this men believed that he was the second coming of Christ. Didn't believe that he had magical healing powers given to him by God. Many of the decisions that recipes in made were harshly criticized, like putting is unqualified friends in powerful positions. If you want to learn more about Ras Poussin the way we did a video about him, find a link to that below Lennon and still continue to write about his revolutionary ideas from Switzerland's and encouraged soldiers do tell him that guns against their officers during the war was almost no one was actually reading the underground newspapers is except for the handful of active Bolsheviks. The vast majority of the Russian people were eager to defend their country, but the war, it was still a disaster.

Speaker 1:          12:17          Millions of people died. Inflation ruined Russia's economy and women were standing in long bread lines. Saw Nicholas the second renames and peaches bag to Petrograd Grad as a symbol of his devotion to the Russian people for years, people that criticized the names and Petersburg because it sounded too German nuns Petrograd whois much more Russian sounding saw. Nicholas believed this would somehow prove his loyalty, but the gesture, it just wasn't enough for the first time. Thousands of Russian people were trained in the military and they knew how to use guns, soldiers and police officers. Well, just as angry as the rest and people were swarming the palace to take over from the sauce all on their own Lennon when he had nothing to do with it. It wasn't even that he was still in Switzerland and he was panicking because the revolution, it was starting without him. The political parties were split into two groups.

Speaker 1:          13:04          The provisional government's which was made up of the representative school, the Duma and the workers, Soviets who were controlled by the trade unions and made up of the peasants soldiers and factory work is letting him knew that he was no match for the provisional government's leader, Alexander Kerensky. He was a seasoned lawyer and is a master of public speaking. Kaminsky resonated with the tumor and since Lennon was not actually a lawyer, he knew that he would lose in a political debate against him, so therefore they then focus his efforts. I'm trying to manipulate the lesser educated workers. Soviets instead, what are you arrived at the train station then his friends with that degrees. MNC hardly said hello before standing on a pedestal to shout at the crowns that they had to done an awful job with a revolution and that it wasn't going to be over until they took down the provisional government's almost.

Speaker 1:          13:48          No one actually agreed with them and they just carried on going about their business even as felt Bolsheviks and they're longer wanted to print his essays because it was such an unpopular opinion. The provisional government was leading Russia back to war against Germany and World War One. It was still going on, but soldiers, they were not happy to serve. It was the reason why that overthrowing the siren in the first place. People wanted the war to be over and either abandoned their posts on the battlefield or can keep you refuse to go in the first place. Then he tried to stand up again and lead these crowds of peasants, but someone from the provisional government shouted that he was a German spy. This made the crown 10 against demons. He had to run away. Alexander Kerensky could see that he was going to cause a lot of trouble for the authority of the provisional government, so he outlawed the existence of the Bolshevik party Lenin.

Speaker 1:          14:34          At this point, he needed to escape. He was on a bad wig, shaved his bids, and Gus on the next train to Finland's Vladimir Lenin. He spent a very long time hiding on a finish farm, continuing to write his ideas and send them back to Russia. Since no one was actually listening to him or agreeing with his ideas, he decided to take Russia by force. One night in October of 1917 he snuck back into Russia and met up with his comrades in Petrograd. By this time, he had convinced more members of the Worker's Party to join us site. He convinced his Bolshevik followers of the red guards to break into the Windsor Palace for a cuter top. They captured members of the provisional government's at gun points. The dream that they were arrested, taken to jail, and Vladimir Lenin became the new leader of Russia without ever being voted in

Speaker 1:          15:22          Bladimir and address the crowd of Russian peasants. That morning after storming the winter palace and introduced himself as the new dictator and as the leader of the Soviet Union, Lenin promised them exactly what they wanted and he did it in the simplest words possible peace, bread, and land. One of his first acts as leader was to bends the war with Germany. People were happy because that's exactly what they wanted all along right from the beginning, he isolated himself at the Kremlin in Moscow so that he could continue writing the Bolshevik party. They wasted no time in spreading propaganda that Vladimir Lenin was like a kind old grandfather who only wanted the best for the Russian people and that they didn't have to worry about anything anymore. Everything was going to be fine. Old granddaddy Lennon was going to take care of you. In reality, though, he was blood thirsty and he wanted his revolution to be as violent as possible.

Speaker 1:          16:11          He told tenants to kill their landlords and encouraged violence against the upper classes. He gave out the orders. Who has read a gone to remove the Romanov royal family from the palace. At that time, the number of men who joined in Lennon's red guard had grown to 200,000 and he had a small army to stand behind him. Many of the Russian people, they protested because they love the Romanovs, especially the young children at first. Then in lied saying that they would be kept somewhere safe, but once he realized that they were too much of a threat to his power, he ordered their execution. Since the family was being held in Siberia, it took a very long time for the public to learn about their deaths. At first, people will leave. There was just saw Nicholas, he was killed and that the women and children were spared.

Speaker 1:          16:51          It would take years for the public to learn the truth of his brutality. He proclaims that every Russian citizens should have good rations, but in order to do that, the farms would have to be controlled by the governments. Farmers Web not allowed to keep or sell the food they grew and all of the crop swept spread out among the entire nation. People could no longer choose their jobs and were given employments in newly constructed factory is based on the needs of the country. Now, some people were happy about this and it gave them a sense of security. Indeed, statues of Lenin were erected around Petra grandsons. Many people called him a hero. Now not everyone was drinking Landon's Koolaid, though plenty of people were furious with him for ordering the death of the innocent Rehmann off children. In 1918 a woman named Fanya Kaplan attempted to assassinate London.

Speaker 1:          17:34          She shot him twice at close range. Now he was seriously injured, but he still managed to survive. Poplin was arrested and she refused to give up the name of any of our co conspirators. She was executed in September of that same, yeah, then it would recover from his injuries in the hospital, but from that day forward he showed no mercy to anyone who expressed even the smallest opposition to this rule. Even though he always encouraged the peasant class to stand up for their rights and rebel against that government. It was no longer okay to do so. Once that was his government, anytime peasants or farmers trying to protest against his new rules, they were killed without mercy. Those who oppose London didn't go down without a fight. Though. In 1918 a group called the white army battled against the Red Army and a civil war fighting to take down the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          18:20          However, the white army was not organized very well and they lost the war. In 1928 farmers were angry that their green was being stolen from them for the greater good of the communist nation. This began what is known as the tumble of rebellion, but they were all gassed by the Red Army runs. Their crops were taken away from their dead hands. At least 50,000 people were in town, mostly women, children and the elderly. Some of them sent to campsis hostages. There were several other incidents like this and any rebellion among the Russian people. It was quickly squashed. Even after trying to make as political philosophy work through threats of death and destruction, Lennon knew wind call quince when millions of people were on the brink of dying from drought and famine. He does something he did to temporarily stop communism and allowed farmers to keep the food that they planted and sell the access food for profit. You know, that's something called capitalism. And surprisingly, this was a huge success. People were no longer starving and the economy improved once things had stabilized again, Lenny went back to forcing food rations. Unfortunately, not every leader who followed in London's footsteps knew when to take a break from communism during a time of famine. Lennon success of Joseph Stalin would be remembered as one of the worst dictators who ever lived for this very reason.

Speaker 2:          19:30          Right

Speaker 1:          19:36          when he was in his 50s Vladimir Lennon's health began to decline and he had multiple strokes. But even when he was in poor health, he was trying to write in his journal to give commands from his bed. When he dies in 1924 people were shocked as they were not expecting him to die. So young hundreds of thousands of people showed up to his funeral, even though it was below freezing temperatures, people were sobbing, upset. This, the one man who truly cared about them was gone. He did manage to make some improvements in the economy and so there was so much pro Lennon propaganda that had been circulated. The people believe that he truly was their savior. Five days after learning passed away, the city of Petrograd was renamed Leningrad in his honor. His body was embalmed so that people could continue to visit him and pay their respects.

Speaker 1:          20:16          That Amir Lennon's reputation, it only became more powerful after his death. He was like a legend who manage to change, not just Russia, but several other countries throughout the world. Communist leaders looked at him for inspiration on how to run their own dictatorships. The USSR, it continued for decades after his death and despite all of its setbacks, the system led to more progress than Russia had seen an hundreds of years before Lennon. The country was very far behind. The rest of the Western world in terms of industrialization, education and modernization. If it were not for all of the reforms made by the Soviet Union, they may have never gotten so far with the space race against the United States, and they still might be lagging behind. Today, in 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed and all of the statues of Lennon, they were torn down. Instead of seeing him as a hero, he has now remembered as a villain.

Speaker 1:          21:05          Lennon grants became Saint Petersburg. Once again, there is no telling how far the nation would have progressed if it were not for the creation of the Soviet Union. But one thing is for sure, without Vladimir Lenin, the world would be a very different place today. So I really hope you enjoyed the video.
