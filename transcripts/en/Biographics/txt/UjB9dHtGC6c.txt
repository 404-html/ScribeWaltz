Ferdinand's Magellan was one of the leading explorers of the age of discovery, often being cited as the first man to circumnavigate the globe. He actually fell just short of that milestone being hacked to death by the natives on the Mariana's islands. Yet his vision and tenacity, despite tremendous odds, opens up the westward route to Asia and established. His legacy is one of history's great adventurers. In today's biographics, we uncover the life and the tragic death of Ferdinand Magellan.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Fascinans Magellan was born around 1480 in the north of Portugal. His family were part Portuguese aristocracy. His father read Omega Hayes was an official in the city of [inaudible] wild, the family of his mother ILDs in a mosquito. We're well connected to the Portuguese royal court. Both parents though they died when Ferdinand was about 10 years of age and he was taken into the royal court is a page boy. Ferdinand's was a page to Queen Leonor wife of King John. The seconds who reigns from 1481 to 1495 he was then 60 to buy his brother, King Manuel the first at the beginning of the 16th century. Just as far as an end was coming of age. Portugal was the most nautically advanced country in Europe. She had the best build ships and the most experienced sailors on the high seas. These advances and allowed the Portuguese to take the lead and exploring the African west coast.

Speaker 1:          01:45          However, the Italian states had already established land based trade routes to the East shutting Portugal out of this lucrative markets. Portuguese businessmen and explorers sought ways to develop their own route to the forest that would bypass the established land based route. And so the rush was on to find eight Seabourn route to the eastern markets. Portuguese explorer Vasco together made a huge breakthrough when he sailed down the African coast and around the Cape of Good Hope and then to the southern tip of India. Over the ensuing decade, the Portuguese established trade relations with the Indian kingdoms. You're in Ferdinand's formative years exploration and trade opportunities. They were constant topics of interest among the Portuguese and ability. The crown was fully invested in this and they were prepared to finance explorations

Speaker 1:          02:35          around 1505 Ferdinand's now in his mid twenties in listed as a member of a 22 ship escort for Francisco Down Meda, the first viceroy of Portuguese India. It is also probable that he traveled to such places like Malaysia and the African territory of Mozambique. In the midst of this flourishing and to cultural trait, he would have been exposed to a dizzying array of cultures, languages, foods, and trade goods. Magellan. He remained in employ of the Portuguese navy for eight years. He was involved in a number of battles. The first being the battle of Canon or in 1506 in this encounter, the Portuguese fleets of less than 10 shifts to feed it in excess of more than 200 much smaller Indian vessels. Magellan, though he was wounded in this encounter in February, 1509 [inaudible] participated in the battle of day you against the Ottoman Turks and southwestern India, which was another Portuguese victory.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Yeah. Later he was president when the Indian city of Goa was overrun having negated the Muslim push into Asia. The Portuguese turned their attention to Malaysia and the city of Malarkey. This island city. It was an international port that served as a gateway to the lucrative spice markets to the south. The Portuguese wanted control over the city and they sent an invasion force to achieve that. In 1511 Magellan, he was one of the invaders who soon conquered the island. Towards the end of 1511 Magellan was awarded for his services with an award of Richards from an exploratory mission to the spice islands of Indonesia. He was also given them ballet slave who he named Henri k. This man was to act as a translator on Magellan's. Later voyage to the Indian Ocean Magellan.

Speaker 1:          04:11          He returns to Portugal in 1513 he'd spent eight years on the seas of the indies. He was out into to a country that was deeply involved both militarily and commercially in the African continent conflicts where I'm going with both the North African pirates and the Muslims who inhabited the consonants. Surely after returning to portrait goal, Magellan joins an expedition against a revolt in the Moroccan city of ours or more. We're okay. I'd been a possession of the Portuguese since 1486 as a result, each of its cities were obligated to pay an annual tribute. However, in 1513 the ruler of Azamara man by the name of Mou lays him on refuse to pay. He then led a revolt against the Portuguese with the goal of pushing the invader out of his country. The king determined to put down the rebellion with overwhelming force in order to teach his subjects the lesson.

Speaker 1:          04:56          He sends an army of 15,000 men under the leadership of the Duke of brick ends up this false. It's soon quashed the uprising within a few years. However, the Portuguese found that the costs involved in keeping us more in order, well more than the revenue generated from the city and it was abandoned during the battle of as in more Magellan, he was thrown from his horse receiving a leg wound that would leave him with a limp for the remainder of his life. This was not the only all happy experience that he had in Morocco as a prominent member of the Victoria saw me. He was awarded some of the spoils of victory, but before long he was accused of carrying on illegal trade with locals by selling some of those spoils back to the Moroccans that a profit, the accusation. It was thoroughly investigated by Magellan's military superiors and he was found not guilty. Still the episode. It certainly left a stain on his sofa. Exemplary record. It seems to have lost him considerable favor with the king whose sister he had served as a page boy in his youth on his returned to Lisbon. Magellan requested an increase in his pension on the strength of a service in Morocco, but this was denied by the king. When you requested permission to accompany several Portuguese military expeditions Magellan, he was again turned down. It was pretty apparent to him that he had lost the trust of demonic

Speaker 1:          06:09          with the king leaving him out in the cold and Magellan now set about formulating plans for his own voyage of expiration. His intention was to find a faster route to the spice islands by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. He was unaware of the size of the Pacific Ocean or the length of the South American continent sins, so imagine that this would be quicker and easier than sailing all the way down to the southern tip of Africa to get to the Indian Ocean. Magellan took his plan to the king requesting financing for the expedition. He used the fact that the Spanish were likely to reach the space islands before women's claimed jurisdiction over its valuable space. Straight as a bit of leverage, however, it King Manuel, he was not moved and he turned down Magellan's request. He did, however, give permission to seek funding from other rulers. Magellan's had his sights on the Spanish crown is the backer for his expedition.

Speaker 1:          06:55          He traveled to Seville where he met up with other Portuguese mariners and navigators. Together they formed a plan to take to the Spanish crown. The expedition would be presented as the opportunity to achieve the Westwood route to the indies that Columbus had failed to achieve in the 1490s there's new routes. It would also avoid competition with the Portuguese who were committed to their well established but much longer route through the Indian Ocean as icing on the cake. Magellan contented that's on the basis of his cartography calculations. The spice islands would be found a lie within territory that was in the possession of the Spanish. The proposal, it was attractive to the Spanish King Charles, the first Magellan and his cartographer refill the Arrow when they joined captains of the expedition. They were also made knights of the order of Santiago and given a 10 year monopoly on all trade in the area through their route, along with 5% of all revenues received from the root.

Speaker 1:          07:41          As a bonus, they would each be given a governorship on the islands. The Spanish crown puts up the money for the purchase of ships and crew and supplies. This, it was a stunning success for Magellan. Yup. Despite the financing and prospects conferred by the king, he soon ran into difficulties. Spanish sailors were incense. The two Portuguese Marin has had been placed at the head of the expedition. When they heard of all the lucrative benefits that the two would receive, they were angry is still members of the Spanish course. I'm able to stomach the king's generosity to these foreigners that attempt to do subvert the expedition. They're leasing a funds was held up resulting in a flow on effect, so that made it virtually impossible for the two captains to make the preparations. Meanwhile, King Manuel the first back in Portugal heard about the Spanish financing of the voyage.

Speaker 1:          08:23          This apparently caused him to feel regret that he had turned down the request. By Magellan. He sat about trying to sabotage the Spanish expedition as well as sending an envoy to the Spanish court for that express purpose. Brahms developed two between Magellan and Fatty Arrow. In fact of the relationship between the became so strained that finally Arrow who has his captaincy revoked Indeed's, he was totally kicked off the expedition. More personnel problems followed. The Spanish prevented Magellan for bringing Portuguese sailors on board despite the fact that many of the men that Magellan wanted were experienced in sailing the parts of the ocean that he was headed to in the ends of the majority of the group were Spanish, showed that there was representation from a number of other lands including North Africa. Magellan's slave on Rico also sailed with his master.

Speaker 1:          09:10          Finally, Magellan had five ships ready to sail. These were the Tryna Dan's upon which he sailed the Victoria, the Concepcion, the Santo, Antonio, and the Santiago. In total there were 273 men. Everything we know about Magellan's voyage comes from the journal that was kept by a crew member by the name of Antonio. Bigger, fatter. They sailed out of Seville harbor on Saint Lawrence Day, August the 10th 1519 during his time in Seville, Magellan had met and married a teenage girl by the name of Beatrice Barbosa, who was the daughter of a Portuguese friends not long thereafter, Beatrice gave birth to their first and only child, a son named Rodrigo. When he sailed out of Seville. This was the last time he would ever see them. The fleet sailed down the Guadalquivir river. Finally, on September the 20th they headed out into the Atlantic Ocean. The first stop was tenor reef in the Canary Islands.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Getting there was plain sailing, but the next leg of the journey from tenor reef southwest across the equator was beset by wild storms. The chronic color picker fatter describes many occasions when the men thought that they were done for us. Terrible storm winds battered the ship. He puts that deliverance down to the divine inheritance of Saint Anselm who showed his presence by a light at the tip of the mast. What he was actually saying was sent Alamos fire and electrical charge that is often seen on the top of mosques and thunderstorms. Having navigated the stormy seas Magellan's set the course for Brazil, which was a possession of the Portuguese, but they have not yet established any substantial settlements that Magellan's five ships reached the Brazilian coast in early November and then move south until they reached the Bay of Rio de Janeiro. Upon reaching South American, Magellan had to face the reality of the geography that it only previously guest apps.

Speaker 1:          10:43          He had assured the Spanish king this. He would discover a street through this consonants that would allow them to pass into the south seas and then make a direct runs the east indies. What he found was that the South American coast ran for far longer than it ever imagines and there was no promise that it finds a straight to cut through it. The realization that they might be forced to add an unknown length of time to their journey by circumnavigating South America caused to tension among the crew from Rio de Janeiro. The fleet traveled south to the Rio de la Plata estuary that they stopped to allow the men to explore in Edmond. Yeah. They came across a tribe of natives described by pig of Fetzer is cannibalistic giants. According to his journal accounts, the crew managed to coax four of the natives, a board, one of the ships, while distracting them with trinkets pickup at a rights.

Speaker 1:          11:25          The captain had the fetters put on the feet of both of them and when they saw the bolts across the fat as being struck with a hammer to reverse and prevent them from being opens. These giants were afraid, but the captain made signs to them that they should suspect nothing. Nevertheless perceiving the trick. This had been played on them. They began to blow and foam at the mouth like bulls loudly calling their devil to help them. Magellan put the other two in irons, but then decided to release them. The actions of the sailors appear excessively aggressive towards the native people. Rio De la Plata, this sled it to devolve into outright combat. Magellan lost his first man. When a sailor was hit in the torso by a poisoned Arrow Magellan. He made a speedy access, but rather than head back out to the open seas, it was decided to head into the river in the belief that it could just be the street that would allow them to cross the continent.

Speaker 1:          12:11          It didn't take them long. However, to realize that the waters, they were traveling in fresh water and so could not have come from the ocean on the other side of the continent. When Magellan realized his mistake, he turned south coming to the port of San Julian in Argentina just prior to Easter of 1520 he decided to they up there over the winter. The rest who would not be without incidence I mutiny was incited by two Spanish. Captain would resented serving under a Portuguese man from the stars. Magellan had the loyalty of the majority of the men and the dissenters. They were sidelined and dismissed during the layer over the Santiago headed off on a reconnaissance mission to the south. It became shipwrecked in the Santa Cruz River. The ship was lost along with one of the crew members. Now, just before we continue with Magellan's journey, let me take a moment to tell you about Squarespace who make these longer videos possible.

Let's get back to Magellan.

Speaker 1:          14:21          Magellan was now down to four ships out to pick it up. The crew from the Santiago, they carried on down the South American coast to Cape Verdean. As there they found a straight between the consonants or mainland's and the islands of Tierra del Fuego. It was the straits. They were looking forward to take them across the far Roshan and his would come to be known as the Straits of Magellan. One ship was sent forth to see whether the salt water would turn to fresh water as they progress through the straits. It didn't and it's the entire fleet. They had it inland's before long. They came to a fork in the waters. Magellan sent the Concepcion and the Santo Antonio were along the southeast channel. While his ship, the Trinidads in the Victoria, they headed south west. During this exploration, many of the crew of the sound to Antonio mutinied since the ship headed back for Spain, the remaining three ships, they figured that the Westwood Channel was the one to follow and so they headed down, it's on November the 30th 1529 by December the first they had made it to the South Sea witch Magenta and rechristened the Pacific Ocean getting through the streets.

Speaker 1:          15:17          It was an impressive feat of maritime skill with many treacherous areas. Haven't been navigators, Mama gentlemen was ecstatic to have found the passage had been seeking. He was also very aware that he was running desperately low on supplies. Stopping to forage on the coast was an option, but this brought with it the risk of further conflicts with the native people. As a result of the decision was made to push on directly into the ocean. Despite the lack of food, they had no idea what they were in for. It would be another 12 weeks before land would be cited. The food situation soon became desperate with pig [inaudible] are recording. We only eight older biscuit reduced to powder and full of grubs and we drank water that had turned to yellow and smelled when even the biscuits were gone. They caught and date wraps and then they were reduced to chewing on leather cloth and Sawdust scoby.

Speaker 1:          16:03          It became rampant since the death toll began to mount among the first to die with the two giants who had been captured a few months earlier, at least 30 of the crew followed them. Finally in January of 1521 and group of uninhabited small islands were scientists finding no food there. They push it on until they came to the island of Guam at the beginning of March on this inhabited islands, they finally found food and supplies from Guam, the fleet headed southwest of the Marianas Islands, which we know today as the Philippines. Magellan was keen to establish friendly relationships with the native people that thanks to the age of his translator on Rica. He was able to establish diplomatic relations through the giving of gifts, the demonstration of arms and tours of his ships,

Speaker 1:          16:47          the people of the Masala islands on which the fees had lands. It encouraged them to move on to what appeared to be the Capitol Island of Subu. This they did, but I'm sure if the reception they would receive, Magellan ordered the artillery to be fired as they enter the port. This period unnecessary as the people, they were friendly but and formed the opinion that the chief of the island's Rasha whom Oban was the king of oldest surrounding islands. So in securing this friendship, he imagines that he now had the allegiance of all of the other islands. In this though he was mistaken. Each islands operated as an independent sovereignty. Still Magellan headed for the islands of Makaton believing this here too. He would get a positive welcome. However, the chief of maketime not lap who refuse to submit to the strange foreigners Magellan was offended and withdrew back to Sebu VA.

Speaker 1:          17:30          He prepared his men to attack the inhabitants possibly on the intelligence if Rhonda, whom I bond. He was convinced that he would not encounter a launch force of resistance. He, while he was wrong, when Magellan, it is false of 60 men waited to show her on Makaton. They were confronted by between one thousand five hundred and three thousand warriors armed with and Arrows, the seders at the benefits of Muskets, but these were cumbersome, slow to load and unreliable hoping to cause confusion. Magellan's sent some of his men to burn the hearts of the natives. However, they were intercepted and killed Magellan's attacking forces. They were unable to gain any grounds. Being forced to fight from the short according to pick a fatter. The natives focus their attention on Magellan, the man who was the leader of the invaders, he describes the end of his captain as such. So many of them challenge down on us that they shut the captain through the right leg with a poison dairy and that's a county ordinance to retire slowly.

Speaker 1:          18:22          But the men took the flight except six to eight of us who remained with the captain. The natives, Sean Tony has our legs for the latter were bad and so many where the spears and stones that they held at us that we could offer no resistance. The natives continue to pursue us and picking up the same spare four or six times, held it at us again and again recognizing the captain and so many tons upon him that they knocked his helmet on his head twice, but he always stood firmly like a good night and Indian held a bamboo spear into the captains face, but the latter immediately killed him with a lunch which she left and the Indians body then drying to lay hand on sword. He could draw it out, but halfway because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spirit. When the native saw that they all held themselves as upon him, one of them wounded him in the left leg with a large cutlass that calls the captain to full face downward when they immediately rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses until they killed off mirror our light, our compass, and our true guide.

Speaker 1:          19:17          When they wounded him, he turns back many times to see whether we were all in the boats therap on holding him dead. We wounded retreated as best we could to the boats which were already pulling off the ship, made a speedy departure to Sebago need to find that Roger Hemovon was no longer friendly. He had around 30 of the sailors poisoned during a feast. After that, the surviving set sail for the spice islands. The goal of reaching those islands when it was finally mess bus Magellan, his page, the ultimate price in its achievements, more than 90% of his men had also perished on the voyage. The captains of the two remaining ships disagreed about the re time. As a result, they parted ways with the Trinidad sailing back across the Pacific while the Victoria took the Portuguese rouge around the Cape of Good Hope. As it turned out to the Trinidad was stopped by Portuguese officials with its crew being arrested.

Speaker 1:          20:04          Victoria arrived back in Seville, Spain on September the sixth 1522 the ship was and down with spices, but the crew were near death from starvation and the ship, but it was about to fall apart. Only 18 men were on board from a total of 237 who had set sail from that port three years out of the APP. But those 18 men, while they had the distinction of being the first to second navigate the globe. So I really hope you found this video interesting.
