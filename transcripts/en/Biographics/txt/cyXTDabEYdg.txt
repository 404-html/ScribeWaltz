It became famous after battling alongside Joan of arc and the name of God, and he was well loved by the French people. No one could have imagined that just a few years later he would be sentenced to death for summoning a demon and murdering over a hundred children for hundreds of years. He was considered to be one of the first serial killers in recorded history. However, some modern day historians believe that he was frames and they aren't trying to exonerate him. So did he really kill innocent children as part of a satanic sacrifice or is he one of the most misunderstood figures in all of history?

Speaker 2:          01:05          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:07          shoulder when he was born in his family castle, the Sham Tassa. So law in 1405 when he was a child shoulder raise parents, they passed away and he was raised by his grandfather. Jacques to crawl. Gilles Ray was born during the hundred years war, which was a conflict between the noble families of England and France. It began in 1337 and ended in 1453 meaning that the war went on for 116 years. Multiple generations grew up in nonstop warfare, kidnapping, death, and torture just became a part of normal life. Considering how dangerous it wasn't that time it became mandatory for all men in noble families to be trained in combat and warfare. At 16 years old, children a rescued the Duke of Brittany who had been kidnapped and taken prisoner as a reward for saving the Duke. The king awarded Jill Deray land grants that allowed him to acquire massive properties for free.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Since he was 12 years old, Jill's grandfather, Joan, was already trying to arrange a marriage for the bike. His first attempt was with a young heiress who was only four years olds off to trying and failing to arrange a marriage for his grandson a few times. Jolanda [inaudible] was able to broker and agreements with the noble families and Brittany. Since Jill save that Duke's life when he was in his early twenties [inaudible] ray married Catherine to through La Dochester Brittany. She was the heiress to one of the biggest fortunes in all of France back then. Women could not own or handle money, so estates were controlled by fathers and husbands. So as to the air of one of the biggest fortunes in France from the deray family, Marion Catherine Dubois made them one of the richest couples in the entire country.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Many everyone has heard the story of Joe Navarro, but it's important to remind you of a tail because her feet shows so many parallels to shield array. The French city of only all had been surrounded and captured by the English. Joan of arc was just a 17 year old peasant girl when she appeared before King Charles the seventh and requested to use his army to defeat the English and free only on, it's hard to imagine how such a young woman without any Nobel status could have had an audience with the king, let alone get him to agree to handover and army. But apparently she was very convincing. Joan claimed that Michael the Archangel, appeared to her in a vision and that God was on his side. She also claimed that she could miraculously heal her wounds. She demonstrated before the court even the deepest wounds would heal with the power of God.

Speaker 1:          03:38          She claims that he was helping her attain supernatural powers in order to become invincible. Some documents actually claimed that the king was actually terrified of Joan and that he was practically forced to say yes. Shoulder a was 25 years old at the time he became the marshal of the army and Joan Devoxx righthand man in just nine days. The two of them led the Ami to victory for France and they became national heroes and holy figures in society. The fact that they fought in the name of God and the Archangel Michael was enough to reinvigorate French citizens, Catholic faith, as you might imagine, it was extremely humiliating for the English to know that they were defeated by a teenage girl when she was just 19 years old. Gen Ivanka was captured by the Bug Indian party who agree with the French nobleman spying for the English. She was taken to court in England and in 1431 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft and memory lived on in the hearts of the French people and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic church.

Speaker 1:          04:44          The Burgundian party managed to kill up, hasn't gone like Joan of arc, but it was far more difficult to capture a well-protected noble person like shoulder ray. He became the marshal of France and he was even more rich and powerful and it wasn't before because he also received awards for winning the see Giovanni aunt. He was also able to strike business deals with other nobles who wanted to work with him. His court grew to be even more luxurious than the king of France and the wealthy leaders of the Catholic church. He decided to retire from fighting. At this point, he was still very young and had all the money in the worlds to do essentially whatever he wanted with. Just like today when people get a windfall of money at a very early age, they sometimes make some stupid decisions on how to spend it. Sports cars and designer watches hadn't been invented yet, but he did invest in several different estates.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Since this was investing in real estate, his family found these kinds of purchases to be acceptable, but it started to get into too crazy. When Jill deray began producing plays, he spent a small fortune on theatrical reenactments of his battles during the hundred years war today, producing multimillion dollar Broadway plays and movies are completely normal but mag. Then he was completely unheard off his play, how to vote 150 speaking roles and over 500 extras who acted as in the battle. 600 different costumes were commissioned for the performance and Taylor's around all the on while working around the clock to make them. He also gave his staff and even the audience and unlimited buffet of free food, which pretty much guarantee that everyone in town would show up to the formats and his own way. He was actually creating jobs and making people happy by entertaining and feeding the peasant class.

Speaker 1:          06:20          But from the perspective of his family, this was horrifying. Has inlaws is in Brittany, spent multiple generations saving and investing so that they had a family legacy and it was sickening to them that this young man was practically burning cash and a garbage fire, but of course it was yielder raise money and he had every right to spend it. However you wanted shoulder rate began paying for his own personal chapel on his estate. This might seem strange, but it wasn't actually that uncommon for members of the European ability to have their own church back in the day. This way, he could still attends mass and do it from the comfort of his own home. It was called Chapel of the holy innocence named after a Vus in the book of Matthew. In this Vus, King Herod orders a mass killing of all children under two years old. It's prevent a prophecy from coming true that a child would grow up to overthrow him.

Speaker 1:          07:07          From a modern perspective, it seems rather creepy. That shields array, which wants a church named after a story about the murder of thousands of children. But some historians say that it's exactly the opposite. In the 14 hundreds the story actually became popular among the French Catholic community. People when they hear a comparison to the tragedy of these dying children in the Bible to the hundred years war, because the entire generations of people who grew up without knowing a time of peace, it was finally the coming in vogue to be a pacifist. By naming his personal church, the chapel of the holy innocence, he was actually making a political statement that he wanted the hundred years war to be over. Considering that many of the noble families profited from constant warfare into capturing territory's. This was even more reason for is in most to be angry with him.

Speaker 1:          07:54          The Duke of Brittany appears before the pipe claiming that the shoulder ray had an addiction to spending money. He requested that the pope would deny his application to have the chapel of the innocence accepted as an official part of the Catholic diocese that you coped. There's a rejection would be enough to stop childer ray from completing the chapel, but he went ahead and built it anyway, even though his judge did not have a real Catholic priests that to say mass shoulder rate didn't let that stop him. He has Taylor's custom meg lavish and colorful costumes for him to wear and he officiated mass himself. This was considered to be extremely blast from us since he was making it very public statement that he knew that he had just as much power as the king and the Catholic Church and there was pretty much nothing they could do to stop him.

Speaker 1:          08:37          His family met with the king asking for a royal decree to stop anyone from entering into a contract with Jill duray. They claimed they were afraid he would spend all of his money and that there would be nothing left in his estate. Thinking agreed to announced the Duke of Brittany to take control over. [inaudible] is a state that you have Brittany making financial decisions on his behalf and he completely cuts off shoulder ray from all of his money often looking over his financial records. The Duke told Jill to ray that he had spent everything he owns and that he was now in debt, so therefore began sending his properties one by one. Lisa shoulder rate nuns. There's one of his favorite castles that the DEU could apparently sold, was actually being gone by a Catholic clergyman named Joel, and if they're wrong and no one was actually living there at all, he was incredibly angry about this.

Speaker 1:          09:22          He wasn't going to stand for the Duke, trying to make him both penniless and homeless. He wanted to go back inside, so he beats and kidnaps Jonah for wrong in order to get the new keys to the castle, get nothing, get a clergyman. It was a very serious crime. He did eventually let the man go, but in the eyes of the Nobel community, it was extremely shocking that shoulder a would do such a thing. It was becoming clear to both the king and the pub. The Jill [inaudible] was not going to go down without a fight. He was so powerful. He could get away with just about anything and stay out of jail. The French people loved him for being a hero and for his generosity to the peasant classes if he wanted to. He even have the ability to raise his own army. This was a very scary thing for the powers that be and they need to stop it now, just before we get into the dark about of this story where he apparently started killing people, I do want to tell you about today's sponsor and I know they're having the sponsor in the middle of the video is not the most awesome thing, but these videos are very long and given the length that we put out, I really hope you do appreciate the need to put the sponsorships in the middle, but I will keep it super brief.

Speaker 1:          11:22          shoulder raise. Family began circulating rumors that he had gone mad and that he was experimenting with Alchemy. Even if this was true, alchemy was very misunderstood. This wasn't a form of witchcraft. It was actually a very early form of chemistry. Years later. Other monikers like Queen Elizabeth the first would hire alchemists as well, but according to this rumor, he was taking those outcomist practices one step too far, taking them into the coals and that it actually sold his soul to the devil. He partnered with an Italian man named Francois [inaudible]. He was really meant to also be an alchemist. Some even say that the two men were in a forbidden romantic relationship and that they both attempted to summon a demon named baron. They said the baron would be able to make goals up here. How to thin app off to trying three times and failing Francois per last.

Speaker 1:          12:09          He apparently told shoulder ray theirs. If they wanted to make the spell work, they would need to be human sacrifice. As the story goes. Shoulder Ray Lewis children to his counsel with the goal of killing them in a ritualistic sacrifice in the 15th century, children would walk the streets alone and go missing all the time. We now know that young kids should never walk up city streets unsupervised, but at that time parents wanted someone else to blame. When that child disappeared back then, it was impossible for people to fathom that even Catholic priests were actually Peter Fallacy where responsible for many of the disappearances for the citizens of a deeply religious Catholic nation, it was actually easier for people to believe that one devil worshiping serial killing alchemist was responsible for the deaths of all the missing children in France. According to the storage builder, Ray would bring in young boys to the console with the promises of making them his page or his squire on and to have their son walk with one of the most famous nights in the country and they wouldn't think twice about letting their son leave with a stranger on a horse.

Speaker 1:          13:08          The boy, however, I'd never come back. The coal claims that he would decapitate the children collect their heads on stakes and Oscar's house guests, which one they thought was the most beautiful. He agree with Todd of collecting heads and began sacrificing these children on a satanic alter, allowing the rotting bodies to pile up and sometimes burning the corpses in the fireplace. After he was accused of worshiping Satan and killing children or shoulder ray and all his servants denied the claims. His friends also came forward and testified on his behalf saying that this was all a lion, that they never saw anything at all like that in his castle, but that testimonies, they were left out of the trial after enduring physical torture. They finally signed confessions to a story that had been written about that crimes, the Oms, these signs, confessions. There was never any physical proof that any of this actually ever happens.

Speaker 1:          13:55          In 1440 childer ray was convicted of witchcraft and Mehta. He was executed on October the 16th of that year. The Duke of Brittany gains control over all of his money and land and divided as among his family. The king even gave them permission to take possession of any former lands that had been sold to pay for Joel to raise depths. The Catholic Church also got a huge chunk of money from this donation. Some say that Jill to raise his body was burned after hanging, which was the procedure for anyone accused of witchcraft. However, the Gutenberg project, which studies various witchcraft cases throughout history says that they found evidence that he was actually given a Christian burial. This was kept a secret because it would prove that the cloud, she completely made up the accusations of witchcraft and devil worship. This story, it was so shocking and salacious among the French people.

Speaker 1:          14:40          It was hard to believe that anyone could make up such a story about anyone to then it felt like they were duped into trusting a wolf in sheep's clothing. The story was told over and over again and it just became a part of French folklore. The story sends the message that with enough money and enough power, they are a stock cracy. You can get away with anything and that the common people must seek justice for inequality. Hanging shoulder ray became like a victory for the people and the peasant classes and many people still believe to this very day that the story they've been told is the truth.

Speaker 1:          15:19          While it's true that shoulder ray confessed to the murders, it was only after torturing him and threatening to excommunicate them from France. They never discovered any bodies of children on his property, even if they were burned, that would still be bone fragments somewhere that all of the evidence, it was circumstantial and it would never hold up in a court of law. Today in 1992 the New York Times reported about the possibility of reopening the case of shoulder re. Many French historians got very defensive about the case, saying that he was truly an awful serial killer and that it's not possible that anyone would be falsely accused of something so horrific. For years, a woman named Margo Kgb collected nearly every book that had been published with information about shoulder rape. She went as far as to translate the original trial documents from Latin and read all of the biographies in both French and English.

Speaker 1:          16:06          She even discovered that the transcripts were also altered after the trauma was over changing children. Ray's testimony to sound even more over the top, adding even more gruesome details to his supposed confession about slaughtering children. Juby wrote her own biography on shoulder ray and held a public retrial on his behalf. She proved that if the same trial happened today, they would never be enough evidence to convict him of Metta. For some, this was enough to efficiently exonerate him. For others, they will never be able to let go of the idea that [inaudible] was one of the worst serial killers who have lived.
