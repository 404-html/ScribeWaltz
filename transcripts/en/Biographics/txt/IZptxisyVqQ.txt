Speaker 1:          00:00          What if I told you that the world's first computer program that was born over 200 years ago, and what if that programmer was a sheep lady? Ava Lovelace was her name. Man's a genius was nearly lost. The history daughters, the famous romantic poet, Lord Byron Ada, was almost relegated as a footnote and her father's biography in the 19th century. At the height of the industrial revolution, she was pushed into the male dominion of mathematics and science by her zealot mother medsource by the father of the computer. She emerged as a woman far ahead of her time and her ability to see what could potentially be not as your typical aristocratic lady. Part of [inaudible] story holds a shadowy secret and on her deathbed, her last wish speaks volumes. Today on biographics, we explore the enchantress of number Ada Lovelace.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Ada Lovelace was born or Gusta eight a Byron in London on December the 10th 1815 to the philandering romantic poet, Lord Byron, and strictly religious Annabella Milbanke Eto was Lord Byron's only legitimate child. Lord and Lady Byron were members of high British society, the social status, and they shed virtually nothing in common. Annabella was analytical and it's conformist. While Lord Byron the cat, little for numbers and logic, true. He was a celebrated and the door poets, yet it's bad behavior raised more than a few eyebrows. He was known to drink from a human skull owner pat to bear and to engage in numerous love affairs with both men and women. One notorious scans are involved in the fat with his own half sister. Let's go on to lover one set of Lord Byron. He was mad, bad and dangerous to know and not surprisingly Annabella and Lord Byron's marriage did not last beyond a year and a contemptuous splits when Ada was only five weeks old.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Lord Byron left the home. He wrote her. This parting is my face like my mother's, my Fairchild Ada sole daughter of my house and Heart, deeply bitter and resentful. Lady Annabella covered his portrait with a large curtain and four bead Ada from ever looking at it for months after Lord Byron left his infant daughter. He left England for good, never to return when Ada was eight years old, speed died of an illness in Greece while fighting in the war of independence. He was 36 years old, although I never met her father. She remained fascinated with him and just poetry over the course of her life. Out of the was determined to steer her daughter away from developing her father's volatile at poetic and sanity as she called us. She truly believed Lord Byron was mentally ill almost to the brink of fanaticism. Annabella saw to it that Ada received an education rigorous and and science.

Speaker 1:          03:00          This was a rather unusual course of study for girls in British Victorian society. Even if Annabella herself was gifted in math, but I referred to her as the princess of parallelograms. Popular opinion of the time favored one of adas later tutors and brilliant mathematician or Gustus Morgan who believed women wearing capable of excelling in the discipline. On the one hand, Morgan acknowledged a disabilities. Yeah, it's in a letter to her mother. He wrote the very great tension of the minds, which they require as beyond the strength of a woman's physical power of application. Basically what he said was that women weren't capable because they were not as strong as men. Well, [inaudible], she was going to prove that wrong. As a young girl and into our teen years, eight it was mostly isolators and did not spend a great deal of time with our mother. Still Annabella was committed to her daughter's education until wellbeing.

Speaker 1:          03:51          She employed some of the greatest intellectual minds to tutor Ada, including William King, physician, William Friends, a social reformer, and Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer, mathematician, and the first woman to be admitted to the Royal Astronomical Society. Eight or in Somerville became close friends. In addition to Algebra and geometry, Ada was taught lessons in history, literature, languages, geography, music, sewing. I'm shorthands. These were all common subject areas, but it mother pound something else. That was far, far more bizarre in an effort to protect her daughter from developing her father's impulses. Ada had to lie still for long periods of time. This was a lesson in self control and it was a bright students and showed promise from math and science. At the age of 12 after a long tour of Europe, she became obsessed with birds and with flight. She researched what she referred to you as fly ology man's imaginatively and methodically.

Speaker 1:          04:48          You conceptualize the flying machine that could flap it's wings. She rides where mother, I've got a scheme to make a thing in the form of a horse with a steam engine in the inside, so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings fixed on the outside of the horse in such a manner to carry it up into the air while a person sits on its back. For her design, she considered the type of material, paper, silk or feathers, navigational equipment or compass and steam the source of power in between throwing herself into intellectual pursuits, eight of battles, sickness. She frequently, it complains of headaches that obscured her vision. In 1829 she contracted measles or common childhood affliction in the 18 hundreds the illness resulted in continuous bed rest for a year and she was disabled temporarily. In 1831 at the age of 16 she was finally able to walk again with the aid of crutches by the age of 17 eight is feeling better and in keeping with the customs of our social class. She was presented at court and it became a popular bell of the season she danced with and charms the various attendees with her brilliant mind.

Speaker 1:          06:02          The industrial revolution was in full force by the time Ed was a teenager. It was a glorious time in history for the advancement of technology and the perfect time for the inquisitive Ada to be coming of age. Make no mistake. She had the makings of a phenom. She had inherent abilities combined with rigorous education. She also had access to intellects, investors and influential people empower all because of her position in society. All of this was the perfect storm and meeting the famed inventive Charles Babbage was eight as a lightening bolts in 1833 of the 17 year old Dado was among a select group to attend a coveted party hosted by Babbage known by many today has the father of the computer I guest wrote at the time one of the three qualifications for those who sought to be invited where intellects, beauty or rank Ada with those requirements while she fit right in at the soiree, Babbage unveiled a small part of his latest machine, a massive mechanical calculator known as the difference engine.

Speaker 1:          06:59          The design for Babbage's engine was revolutionary and it's fully constructed. It was perform the work of an army of men crunching numbers. The machine would be powered by steam and would methodically perform complex calculations using only edition by breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces known as the method of finite differences, then is which printouts that you values into a table. Babbage's machine had enormous potential in the 19th century since tables were used in many areas, including navigation, astronomy, and engineering. With this powerful calculator. Human error would be erased. The engine was accurate within 31 decimal places so many guests that night. Babbage's invention was a hunk of metal and less or more than a party favor but not to ada to Morgan's wife was there and later wrote of the night when most of the guests looked on with the expression that savages show on seeing a looking glass. Miss Byron youngest, she was understood it's working and saw the great beauty of the invention. Babbage must have been impressed with eight as intellect and enthusiasm for the machine from that night on. He remains her mentor and Lifelong friends.

Speaker 1:          08:15          Babbage's difference engine would not come to be after a disagreement with his engineer, Joseph Clemens. In those days by law, the engineer owns the drawings and after they're falling out, he could not get them back. Consequently, the British government also withdrew their funding for the projects. This forced manage back to his original concept, but he came up with an even better idea in 1834 a far more complex machine that he called the analytical engine. The analytical engine is considered to be the world's very first programmable general purpose computer. The basic structure of the engine is essentially the same as modern day computers. Of course, Babbage's machine was massive in scale. His entry level machines would have been 40 feet long by 15 feet high, but he's talked about others that were 10 times that size, nothing like this had ever been conceived or attempted before. In fact, in his lifetime, only a small trial engine was constructed.

Speaker 1:          09:08          This analytical engine, it consisted of four components, the mill, which calculated units, the store where the data was held for processing as the reader and printer, the input and output devices. It was truly groundbreaking and would largely become adas legacy. Since eight or in Babbage's first meeting, she became his protege. He was the teacher and she was the pupil. After Babbage showed or the plans for the analytical engine, she eagerly went on a tour of cotton mills in the north of England to see the most technologically advanced machine of the day. The Jacquard loom the limb automated. It's the weaving of patterned silk and it was controlled by a series of punch cards. It was fascinating and it was also controversial. The cotton mill with a jacquard loom didn't need skilled workers to weave intricate patterns while groups such as the blood, I'd swear protesting against these machines on account of replacing workers jobs.

Speaker 1:          09:58          Ada was thinking something else entirely. She was deeply interested in the genius behind the punch cards and wanted to know how men were translating the complicated patterns into something simple. She saw the similarities. Do you have a loved and machine and later wrote the analytical engine weaves Algebraic patterns. Just as the Chicago loom weaves flowers and leaves for the next 10 years in between getting married and having three children, eight have focused all her energy into learning everything she could about the analytical engine she wrote. I think I am more determined than ever in my future plans and I have quite made up. My mind's that nothing must be suffered to interfere with them. I intend to make such arrangements in town as well, secure me a couple of hours daily with very few exceptions. For my studies. After attending one of Babbage's rare lectures, a military engineer in future Italian prime minister, Luigi man of Breyer wrote an impressive article sketcher of the analytical engine invented by Charles Babbage Squire.

Speaker 1:          10:55          The paper was extremely detailed and mathematical and there was also written in French. Ada decided to translate the paper and since she knew the engines so well she could add her own thoughts to us any years later. Babbage claim to have told data to translate it and write her own accounts and she responded by saying she hadn't thought of it either way, she went about the task like a devil possessed and when she was finished her notes with three times as long as the original paper eight or published or completed article in scientific memoirs and English Scientific Journal published by Richard Taylor in 1843 a. Dot. Only used her initials on the paper. Aal Standing for Augusta, Ada Lovelace. The parts of the paper that gives wait ages creditors first computer programmer comes in section g and it's eight a wrote of how the engine could be programs with a code to calculate Bernoulli numbers.

Speaker 1:          11:42          This was an algorithm to be carried out by a machine and thus the first computer program along with numbers eight Ada describes how codes could be created for the device so it could handle letters and symbols. She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions or looping a process. Computer programs still used today. Hey are also offered other other concepts in her paper such as her thoughts on artificial intelligence. She wrote, the analytical engine has no pretentions want to have to originate anything. It can do whatever. We know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Her notes worked significance and that they captured aiders vision for the analytical engine and this is where she exceeds her mentor and her understanding of its full potential. Babbage's historian wrote eight or saw something that Babbage in some sense fail to see in Babbage's weld his engines.

Speaker 1:          12:35          We're bound by number. What lovely saw was that number could represent entities other than quantity. Looking back from the present high ground of modern computing. If we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada. In that 1843 paper. Babbage was impressed with Ada and wrote, the more I read your notes, the more surprised I am Andrew guys and not having earlier explored. So richer vein of the noblest metal. The next obvious step for the analytical engine would have been Babbage's and adas crowning moments, but it would not come to pass. Babbage was known to be a difficult man and he argued with politicians, so for his machines, the relationship with parliaments was particularly salad. After Babbage fail to deliver his government funded difference engine, the loss of money in those days was the equivalent to two Royal Navy warships. Ada had a plan to promote the engine, but it was a sensitive subjects. One she breached in a letter dated August the 14th 1843 she asked about Ej if she could take over him for promoting the analytical engine while he stepped aside and focus only on building it. She ended up with you will won them over this last query, but I strongly advise you not to reject us. Vantage though he said no, refusing all of her conditions that interest would not give up control and he likely saw her asking as an audacious move.

Speaker 3:          13:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:02          Depending on the lens you use to evaluate data, she can be hailed as a genius, say Victorian High Society Lady, a mother and wife, a Gambler, adulterous or drug addicts and truth. She may have been all of those things. She was like most of us complex and contradictory as one would expect a to married and had children. She went William King, not William King who was a tutor in 1835 at the age of 19 he was 30 king seem to be a precise, conscientious and decent man if somewhat stiff. Three years after they tied the knots, king became the Earl of Lovelace. Ada took the title account tests of Lovelace. They had three children together. Byron born may of 1836 and Isabella called Annabella born in September of 1837 and Ralph Gordon born in July of 1839 four at a time between 1835 and 1839 eight or focused most of our energy running the large households.

Speaker 1:          14:52          She found herself time for horse riding, learning the harp and studying mathematics after their third child was born, eight or 10 tev retention back to maths and the sciences and was Tuesday. It's by Augustus to Morgan and her husband. King were supportive socially. The couple had many prominent friends and acquaintances including the writer Charles Dickens. In addition to you headaches and since the measles suffered in childhood, Ada had recurrent health problems as an adult. After about of color in 1837 she had problems with asthma and her digestive system. She was prescribed a powerfully addictive painkiller and opiates, which was to be taken with wine. The drug altered her personality and she reported hallucinations and mood swings. In 1841 ada and Maduro relieve the daughter of Lord Byron's half sister or Gustus Lee were told why Adas mother, that Lord Byron was also Madora his father in February eight a road to another.

Speaker 1:          15:43          I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years, felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it in proper in me to hinted to you that I in any way suspect it. She did not blame the incestuous relationship on her father, but instead blamed or Gusta Lee. I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was in the 1840 [inaudible] has self flirted with scandals first with relaxed relationships with men who went. Also husbands, which led to rumors. She was having affairs and then an old family vice surfaced. Haters. Life took a shadowy turn in 1851 when she began gambling on horses. Perhaps she was trying in vain to raise funds for her beloved analytical engine, but no one really knows. Hey Deb, she did not act alone. She was part of a gambling ring and in the spring season, hot bats went horribly wrong.

Speaker 1:          16:32          It has been said, I ate a may have devised a mathematical scheme. Do you predict the winning horses? If so, though it didn't work in a fails, battered the EPSOM Debbie Ada ended up owing the equivalent of roughly half a million pounds to get out of her dad. She pawned off some of the family jewels in 1852 80 became gravely ill man. She took to her bed. She died painfully and slowly. A future in cancer on November the 27th 1852 at the age of 36 the exact age her father had been a few months before she died. She made an unknown confession to our husbands that made him leave her bad side, her final wish. Where's an act of defiance against her mother. Ada wants to be buried next to the man who loomed large in her life, but she never knew her father age. His body was taken miles away from our home to the buyer and family volts inside the Church and sit and Mary Magdalene and the small English town of [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          17:23          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          17:31          that's brain of mine is something more than merely mortal. As time will show eight his contributions were buried for 100 years, discovered by a scientist, Alan Turing in the 1940s during the second world war during with something of a kindred spirit who was also interested in the same things. She was machines that could act upon instruction. His work ultimately led to the effort to build a machine with the code name, the bomb that deciphered encrypted messages sent by hit. This armed forces tierings work had begun before reading eight his notes on the analytical engine, yet he was greatly influenced by them. She, along with Babbage, essentially paved the way for tiering who is considered today as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Consequently, as notes surfaced for the weld and BV Bowden's Book Faster Than Thought a symposium on digital computing machines from 1953 then during the 1970s in the u s department of Defense develops a high order computer programming language to supersede the hundreds of different ones then in use by the military.

Speaker 1:          18:33          This programming language was named Ada. They is still used around the world today and the operation of real time systems in the aviation health care, transportation, financial infrastructure and space industries in the present day in international celebration takes place on the second Tuesday of October. That would be Ada Lovelace day founded in 2009 by sue Sharmane Anderson. It's aim is to recognize the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering and maths. It also has the goal of increasing the profile of women in these areas and in doing so, creating new role models who will encourage more girls into these sectors. Ada is everywhere in our modern digital wells, immortalized on the internet forever in news articles, blog posts, memes, quotable quotes. There's even some controversy of whether or not she deserves the claim of first computer programmer, but there is no denying her vision surpassed any of her contemporaries including Babbage in all his 11 volumes of published writings he never wrote of the aspirations for computing like Ada has, those who have learned to walk on the threshold of unknown worlds by means of what's are commonly termed par excellence.

Speaker 1:          19:37          The exact sciences may then with the fairways, wings of imagination, hope to saw further into the unexplored mist which we live.
