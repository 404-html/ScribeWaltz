Speaker 1:          00:00          When we think about the civil rights movement in the United States, most people immediately think of Martin Luther King Jr and almost everyone can recite the beginning of his either dream speech, but the story of another human rights activists, Malcolm X is often sensitive in history costs. He is misunderstood as somebody preached hate and violence against white people and some believe that if young people watched his speeches, it could actually be rather dangerous because of that, his memory is often swept under the rug while everyone knows him by name. Not Enough people know the true story of Malcolm x. He was one of the most influential Americans who ever lived and his legacy, it's still that goes on to this very day. Without him, the u s and maybe even the entire world's would be a really different place in today's buying graphics. We're going to talk about the incredible life of Malcolm x.

Speaker 1:          00:56          A boy named Malcolm little was born on May the 19th 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. He was one of seven children belonging to Louise and Earl little Malkin's. Barron's taught their children all about the history of slavery and the importance of rising above their circumstances. Now can any siblings, they were all extremely well behaved even from a young age because they knew that they were trying to represent their race in a positive light. His father oh believes in the teachings of a man called Marcus Garvey black nationalist leader who preached that African Americans should be self sufficient when it came to running their own farms and their own businesses. Oh, was a baptist minister who pushed for desegregation between white and black people. Because of this, the family received death threats from the KKK on a daily basis, so they were constantly moving just to stay alive. In 1929 oh little bought his family a four Acre farm in Lansing, Michigan, which had a very good neighborhood with great schools.

Speaker 1:          01:50          The only issue was that they were the only black family in town. Now, hey isn't something that children are born with. So Americans, classmates in kindergarten treated him just like everyone else. Malcolm's favorite game was Robin hoods and he always invited his friends over to run through the fields and the forests of his family farm pretending to steal from the rich and give to the poor. Eventually the racist members of the community. They caught wind of this black family living a comfortable middle class life and while I didn't like it, the neighbors complained saying that black people should not be allowed to own so much land even though there was no law saying that they couldn't live there. The local council voted on the issue and degreed that the little family had to move all this all refuse to leave saying that his family had every right to stay, that Lansing Michigan was home to an offshoot of the KKK called the Black Legion is that of wearing silly white robes with pointed hoods.

Speaker 1:          02:38          They dressed up and even sillier pirate costumes. You really couldn't make these things up one night, the list of family or work to an explosion. As these white supremacists held bombs of their house earlier, newies had to wake up the children and get them to safety. Despite the explosions, which could certainly be heard for miles local firefighters. They never showed up to help and the house it burned to the grounds. In the morning, I'll this or confronted the local police. He accused them of being members of the Black Legion. The police responded by arresting and vast and saying that he burned down the house to receive an insurance settlement. The charges, they were late to drop even after this, they refuse to leave because they wanted to be an example of the black family who stood their ground and didn't give up without a fight. Unfortunately, their strength and resolve it was not enough to convince the citizens of Lansing that they were worthy of living there.

Speaker 1:          03:25          When Malcolm was just six years old, L's body was found crushed on the tracks of a street car, the car, enough rules in accidents. The police said that he committed suicide and his autobiography of Malcolm x explains that his father had sustained injuries and all consistent with the street car accidents. Despite the coroner statements to the Insurance Company that tells l policy refuse to pay. Louise. Due to that contention that ELLs death was a suicide, Malcolm's mother had a very difficult time raising eight children alone. She sold many of their belongings into which, so for people in town in order to make an income, she rented their lands, other local farmers, but there was never enough money to go around. She was a proud woman, though she lived by our principals and she never asked for a handout from anyone. The family, they seem not to go on welfare, but as the years went on, the weight of the responsibility continue to tear away.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Atta Louise knew that the white people in town, they hated her and that the men responsible for her husband's death. They were I think twice by, she was constantly afraid that someone would come off to and to children even though her fears were completely justified. She was diagnosed as paranoid and that local police committed her to a mental institution. Malcolm was 13 when his mother was taken away and he and his six siblings were split up and sent to orphanages and foster homes. They kept in touch by writing letters to another and swore that they would all reunite again someday just by all of these setbacks. Malcolm still had a lot of ambition for himself and he never forgot the lessons that his parents taught him. In the eighth grade, he was a straight a students and at the top of his class he was intelligent, charismatic, and they had a passion for public speaking.

Speaker 1:          04:56          What do you went to high school? He joined the debate team and continue downing a 4.0 GPA. One of his teachers asked everyone what they wanted to be when they grew up and Malcolm said that he wanted to become a lawyer. The teacher said that this was impossible, saying that black people were simply not allowed to be liars is steep. Show up for the responded. One of life's first needs is for us to be realistic. You need to think of something you can be. Why don't you plan on carpentry in Rihanna? [inaudible] name's Malcolm bl and had already become America's first black lawyer in the 18 hundreds but of course Malcolm could not have known that he believes his teacher was right. He was still living in foster care and he no longer had his mother and father to encourage him despite being a straight a students. He thought that as a black person, there truly was no point in continuing at school. He dropped out in order to begin working and start a new life.

Speaker 1:          05:49          When he was 17 Malcomb moved to New York City to live in Harlem. He got a job doing dishes at a restaurant and is charismatic person now as he helps him make a lot of friends of all races, why men begins to approach him, asking if he had any drugs, if he could hook them up with black girls. Since people were already making that assumption based on stereotypes, he decided that he might as well take advantage of it. This started is successful side hustle of being a pimp, a robber or rackets here, and a drug dealer. He befriended John L. Roy Sanford, fellow dishwasher at Jimmy's chicken shack and haul who aspired to be a professional comedian. Both men had reddish has say Sanford was called Chicago, red off to his hometown and little was known as Detroit red. He has later at Sanford became famous as Red Fox.

Speaker 1:          06:31          One of littles best friends was a teenage boy. He had his first name, Malcolm Jarvis, the two of them. They hustle together and they would go out to jazz clubs at night. They was zoot suits and impress. The ladies with their dance moves for a wall. They were raking in a loss of money and having the time of that lives in 1949 the two Malcolm's were both dating white girls who they met at a nightclub. These girls had very rich parents and they were bored cup to maniacs looking for a bit of excitement. They encouraged the Malcolm's to form a Bonnie and Clyde star ganged together. They would let the boys know whenever their parents, neighbors were on vacation and then they would all go and steal from the homes together. Malcolm, Mr felt that he was playing a grown up version of Robin Hood, but when the group was caught, it caused a huge outrage in the courts because of them mixed races.

Speaker 1:          07:13          No one could believe that to rich white girls could have possibly been at the masterminds behind the robberies, and of course their parents could afford to get them lawyers. So the girlfriend's lied under roof cleaning, that they didn't even know the boys and that they had been kidnapped and forced to participate in the robbery. Both Malcolm's, we're only 20 years at the time, and they both received the maximum sentence of eight to 10 years in prison. The women were able to walk free without any punishments. When he was in prison, Malcon realized that many black men were totally innocent and had been falsely accused of crimes. These innocent men, they turned to God in order to cope with their feet. But this made Malcolm very angry. He had become a staunch atheist because he believed that if there were truly a god, he wouldn't let black people suffer like they were suffering.

Speaker 1:          07:55          He yells at other inmates. We being stupid enough to believe in God and claims that even if he did exist, he had abandoned his black people completely. An elder inmate, John Bembry could see that he was very angry and in a lot of pain. So he told Malcolm this. If he could not escape through religion, he should turn to books instead because it could help transport his mind to other places. Malcolm took this advice and began to read every book in the Prison Library for the first time in his life. He was reading Shakespeare and all of the other great works since he, Trudy did escape into his own mind,

Speaker 1:          08:32          often being in prison for some time. One of Malcolm's brothers wrote to him explaining that his siblings and finally reunited and they were attending meetings of a group called the nation of Islam, Malcolm right bags that he did not believe in any god, but there's brother promised him that if he started praying to Allah, he would get out of prison early. His brother sent him a book written by Elijah Muhammad, who was the leader of the nation of Islam. In his book, Elijah Muhammad wrote that black people were already going through that own version of hell on earth and that's white men with ad demonic oppresses the nation of Islam shed some of the traditional beliefs of Middle Eastern Islam, but it mostly focuses on raising the confidence of black people saying this. They were actually the superior race. He encouraged them to educate themselves, become self sufficient, and have pride in their race.

Speaker 1:          09:16          This was basically the way that Malcolm had been raised by his parents and it was clear that Elijah Muhammad's teachings paralleled those of Marcus Garvey. Malcolm decided to give the nation of Islam the chance, even though he had never set foot in a mosque before. He started to grow his beard, refuse to eat pork. Parkins prayed to other several times a day. The prison guards, they tried to stop him, so he wrote to the governor demanding that is an American citizen. He should have the right to choose his religion. Say positive at large in Muhammad's teachings was to stop trying to please or integrate into white society and take pride in being an African American. Some Alpha dropped his last name, little which was given to his ancestors when they were slaves as a sign of ownership. He had no idea what his family is real African tribal name had been so he decided to replace it with a simple x representing the missing family history that had been stolen from him.

Speaker 1:          10:04          He lays you wrote for me, my ex replaced the white slave master name of little, which some blue eyed devil names little imposed upon my potato forebears. Now there's, he went by Malcolm x. He started a debate team and the prison and men would go to listen to him speak. He was such an amazing speaker that several other men were convinced to join the nation of Islam and they began to pray together. Instead of being meek and subservient to the white gods, they stood tool and suddenly seemed Fomo, confidence, and powerful than ever before. This made the prison guards nervous. They thought that Malcolm x might have too much control and those he was released. He would incite riots and start a race war. The warden notifying the FBI and he was placed on a watch list and denied parole despite his good behavior. He was finally released from prison after six years and he immediately became a Minnesota for the nation of Islam and Detroit, Michigan.

Speaker 1:          10:52          He was so good at speaking that he was given the position of national spokesman when he first got started. Elijah Mohammed only had managed to gather 500 members into the nation of Islam in the United States in 1952 but once Malcolm x toward and gave speeches, it quickly grew to over 30,000 members. By 1963 Malcolm x was constantly trying to build up the confidence of African American people. He encouraged black people to feel proud of that natural hair and their dark skin and never trying to compare themselves to white people. He encouraged them to open their own businesses in Harlem, barbershops, butches restaurants and clothing stores owned by black people sprang up for the very first time in American history, this box, a trend across the nation and lack of businesses. They became commonplace in all major cities. It was at this point that Malcolm x met and fell in love with a woman named Betty Sanders.

Speaker 1:          11:39          Since the two they got married, they would go on to have six daughters together. Malcolm started a fraternity, agree of cooled the fruit of Islam. These were men who were like a private militia. They were always clean. Cartons were brand new suits with pride. They would and he taught them to never use violence and less. It was in self defense. After all, peaceful civil rights protestors were being hosed down, beaten by police and attacks by God dogs. He believed that if they wanted to get things done successfully, they needed to prepare for the possibility that if they began to fight for their rights, it might cause a war between black and white people. The fruit of Islam. They were taught never to attack fast, but they should not accept a beating without fighting. Back on April the 26th 1957 one of the members of their congregation, Johnson x Henson, was taking suits out of his car in front of the Muslim 10 building in New York City.

Speaker 1:          12:30          Police officers saw this and they accused him of stealing the suits. When he tried to explain that they belong to the congregation, they beat him with heavy clubs and detained him in the police station without giving him medical attention. Malcolm x seat rushed in the police station and asked to see Johnson. When they told him to leave, he told the officers to look out the window. A line of men wearing crisp suits, sunglasses and for doors were all standing out on the streets. It was an entire army of the fruit of Islam ready for Malka disorders. When they finally agreed to let him see Johnson. Malcolm demanded that they call an ambulance because he was bleeding heavily and dying of his injuries. The militia followed them all the way to the hospital, but it was confirmed that Johnson would survive. Now waved his hands and the militia dispersed, preventing what would have been a massive right.

Speaker 1:          13:14          This terrified the NYP d and it was clear that even though they had no idea who he was until that day, he was a very powerful man in New York City. One officer was quoted as saying, no man should have that much power. It needs to try to sue the city to pay for Hinton's medical expenses, but they denied everything. Malcolm x decided to travel across the country and convert new people to the nation of Islam. They eventually opened to Muslim temple in Los Angeles in 1962 and almost identical situation happened all over again. A man named Ronald Stokes was taking the dry cleaning out of a car in front of the mosque. The police accused him of stealing the suits and when he tried to explain, he put his hands up and they again shooting him at close range. 11 men rush to help their friends and tried to pull the police officers away, but they were all arrested and they were all accused of being part of a so-called mob in the local newspaper.

Speaker 1:          14:01          It was printed that this was a Muslim riot in courts and the police officer who shot and killed Ronald stakes and method that he knew that stokes was unarmed, but that he shot him first because he raised his hands in a menacing way and just 25 minutes, the white jury decided that this was enough justification to murder him and the officer he was set free. Immediately after this man got away with murder, 11 members of Nation of Islam were found guilty of assaulting a police officer and they were all sent to prison. After this incidence, Malcolm x realize that the fight was too much for even the nation of Islam to handle. He calls for all black people to come together regardless of their religion. In order to fight for civil rights following stags, his death. Malcolm x gave one of his most famous speeches. We are oppressed, we are exploited, we are downtrodden. We are denied not just civil rights, but human rights. So the only way we are going to get some of this oppression and exploitation away from us is to come together against a common enemy.

Speaker 1:          15:02          For years, Malcolm x was the face of the nation of Islam, and even though he was spreading the teachings of his mentor, Elijah Muhammad's the man, rarely did any of the work himself. Once a month, Malcolm would visit Chicago to give money to Mohammad for his living expenses. One day he ran into three young women who were knocking on Muhammad's door. They were demanding that he give them money for food and child support. He learned from them that Elijah Muhammad had cheated on his wife and eight children with six different secretaries. The girls were all only 16 or 17 years old at the time. So this was also a statutory rape. He was not taking responsibility for his kids and he had ruins the lives of these young women. Malcolm Austin, Elijah's son wireless. If this was actually true, when's he admitted that he and his mother knew, but they were in denial.

Speaker 1:          15:45          The followers were so blindly faithful to Elijah Mohammad's that even when the word spread that the founder of the religion was a liar and a hypocrite, they accused Wallace of lying about his father. Mohammed confirmed the room is in 1963 attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by biblical prophets. Malcolm x did not leave nation of Islam right away though, but he did distance himself. He focused more on preaching about the civil rights movements for a time. He thought that he had been tricked into living a lie since he was struggling with this Muslim faith. Malcolm x took a pilgrimage to Makkah in Saudi Arabia in 1964 he was shocked to see people of all races making the pilgrimage together. Elijah Muhammad's was teaching that white people were evil, but once Malcolm saw what true Islam was like, he knew this was proof that Brotherhood amongst the human race could exist.

Speaker 1:          16:33          He'd seen it with his own eyes. He no longer believe that Martin Luther King Jr was preaching a pipe dream. He was inspired to give himself a new name. I'll hogene Malik, I'll Shahbaz. He spent an additional three weeks traveling around, so several countries in Africa. When you were to the United States, he was a completely changed man. He no longer preach that white men were devils and he said that all people needed to come together and live in peace. On march the eighth 1964 he announced that he was leaving the nation of Islam and he exposed all of the corruption that he had kept secret. Until then, he can bad the religion to a mafia crime ring. This he no longer wanted to be a part of. He said that if anyone wants to follow him, he was going to start up his own Muslim group called Muslim mosque inc.

Speaker 1:          17:14          This was a huge threat to Elijah Muhammad's livelihood. Of course, and if at a target on Malcolm's back, are you not perhaps afraid of what might happen to you as a result of making these revelations? Oh yes. I probably am a dead man already. Malcolm received death threats, but he kept moving and began traveling with a new found motivation to bring peace to all nations. He became an international diplomat and traveled to 14 African countries meeting with 11 heads of state. He wants it to discuss the treatments of African Americans and the human rights issues that they were facing in America. He encouraged the United Nations step in to help black people in the United States since he believed that the American government, we're not doing enough to support the rights of black people, the FBI and CIA. They were following him wherever he went and he was receiving harassing phone calls on a daily basis.

Speaker 1:          18:02          Elijah Muhammad told Boston Minister Louis acts later known as Louis Farrakhan that hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off, and the April 10th edition of Muhammad speaks featured a cartoon depicting Malcolm x is bouncing severed heads. His house in New York, it was later firebombs and his wife and daughters were very nearly killed. Malcolm x publicly announced that he knew Elijah Muhammad had ordered a hit on his life and that he was going to die soon. Unfortunately, it was right in 1965 Malcolm x was giving a speech in New York City when a member of the nation of Islam shot him in the chest at close range with a sawed off shotgun to other men, five semiautomatic handguns. He had 21 gunshot wounds on his body. He was 39 years old or an activist. Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy describing Malcolm x's are shining black prince who didn't hesitate to die because he loved us.

Speaker 1:          18:52          So Malcolm x was only just beginning his new goal of attempting to change the lives of African Americans everywhere, and there is no way of knowing just how much you would have accomplished if he was given that chance before his death. He had admitted that he had made a mistake by preaching hate against white people when he first got started and he was ready and willing to go along with Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement if he were still alive today. There is no telling just how much more he would have accomplished even in his short time on earth. He inspired African Americans to be the people proud of their skin color because of him. Black people everywhere began to demand more for themselves and from the expectations of everyone in their country. No matter what religion someone is subscribed to, they can still find inspiration from listening to his speeches about human rights and whether they know it or not. There is so much in American society that would have never existed without the influence of Malcolm x. So I already have you found that video. Interesting.
