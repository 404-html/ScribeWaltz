Speaker 1:          00:00          In 1951 doctors took a tissue sample from a poor dying black woman that was given to researches without setting knowledge or have permission. The healer cells names for the patient's first and last name acted differently than other cells in the lab. They were heartier and they replicated at an amazing rate. They also didn't die. Cultivation of healer launched a revolution in biomedical research and is a multibillion dollar industry. The cells were sold all over the world and lead to important advances to find human kinds, deadliest diseases including polio, HIV, and cancer. No one aside from the patients, doctors and lead researchers knew the origins. If the healer cells, I'll say her name or anything else about her life. Two decades passed before this mystery woman was revealed and it was many more years before her family had answers to their most burning questions. Today we examined the woman behind the notorious and immortal Hilo cells. Henrietta lacks

Speaker 1:          01:12          on August the first 1920 and Louisa lags pleasant, gave birth to a baby girl, the Reta in a shack at the end of a dead end road in Roanoke, Virginia. At some point during her life. Laresa changed her name to Henry Assa though no one knows why they're shy overlooking the train depot was the young girl's home until I mother tragically died. Henrietta at this point was any four years olds. Eliza passed from this life to the next to cheering Charles bath with her 10th baby, leaving our husbands, Johnny or widow, unable to take care of all the children. He sent them away to live with family 125 miles southeast from Roanoke and southern Virginia. The lacks family lived in the town of clover, just past difficult creek on the banks of the river of death. Now this might sound like a bad omen, but it's in the 1920s it looks like a lot of small towns in rural Virginia on the outskirts, fields of tobacco and old plantation houses, dotted the rolling hills and on main streets down the dusty roads.

Speaker 1:          02:05          The town buzzed with life. There was a movie theater, grocery store, post office shops, restaurants, and a train depot. Henrietta. We didn't recognize the town today cause I've lost so many of us residents by the late 1990s that it's official charter was revoked in the last census in 2010 the population had dwindled to a mere 438 when Johnny came to town in 1924 Henry Essa and ten nine brothers and sisters had to be divided up amongst the relatives. No one could take all 10 children. Henrietta ended up living with her grandfather. Tommy lacks in a four room log cabin calls the home house. Generations of Laksas have lived and died. They're buried in the small family plus Henrietta could see out of a window formerly slave quarters. The home house was a simple structure with no electricity or indoor plumbing, only gaslands and water that Henry has a holds up from the creek below.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Tommy, it was already caring for another grandchild. Nine year old day. When Henry came to live at the home house, the children shared a room. Men's works everyday together planting and harvesting the tobacco and tending to the animals in the garden. After the day's work, they sometimes swam in the swimming hole, had bonfires at night and played ring around the Rosie with their cousins once a month during harvest, grandpa, me and the cousins headed to South Boston to the second largest tobacco market in the nation to sell their crop. It was a time they all look forward to, even if the market wasn't a safe place for children, whether it's free flowing, booze, prostitution, and it's the occasional murder at the home house. Henrietta, I work every morning at four o'clock to milk the cows and feed the pigs. When she was finished with her morning chores, she walked two miles to the schoolhouse for colored children pass the white school where children three rocks is her and called her names. Jim Crow laws segregated blacks from whites and that remained in place until 1964 in the short 31 years of her life, it was all she knew. By sixth grade, Henry has a walk to the school house one last time, like day and the other Lexus she dropped out to work in the tobacco fields.

Speaker 1:          04:09          Few public photos of Henrietta lacks exist. The most well known is a striking image from a 19 seventy's rolling stone article of a smiling at smartly dressed woman in a skirt, suits, jackets and open toe sandals. I hadn't sought firmly placed on her hips into a Walmart highs glimmer at the camera. She looks self assured with a hint of mischief spread about in her grin. It's obvious even by today's standards that Henrietta was beautiful. She was the envy of other women and desirable to all of the men are rounds out. It wasn't only her beauty that attracted people to Henrietta have cousin QT described errors. Lovie dovie as kind as she was pretty always taking care of family and friends in need as a child. Cuti had been stricken with polio and Henrietta took care of him when it got bad. Everyone who knew her remembers Henrietta and her as a Gen Xer, caregiver, and a strong woman.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Even when cancer was spreading inside her body, she didn't make a fuss or draw attention to herself. Very few people knew until the end quite how she suffered. Henry had no shortage of men vying for her affection. As a young woman, Henry asset chose day, a cousin with whom she shared a bedroom and had spent countless hours with since the age of four they had their first baby, a boy named Lawrence out of wedlock. When Henry out, it was barely 14 years old. He was born on the home house floor like his father runs numerous cousins, aunts and uncles and grandparents before and other likes. Baby Elsie was born four years later. Eventually Henry Essa and day said their vows and a private marriage ceremony. On April the 10th 1941 she was 21 and he was 25

Speaker 1:          05:45          by the winter of 1941 the country was at war and small tobacco farms including Henry Asher and days, well barely making enough to make ends meet, but to the north there was opportunity in the booming factories. Demand for steel was increasing. A great migration of black families came to Turner station. Mary Lynn's leaving behind the southern farms. That's Bethlehem Steel Sperry points in Baltimore County. A black man could make up to 80 cents an hour. At the most, any of the waxes and seen in factories. Black men took the jobs, white men rejected and they were exposed to a host of toxic chemicals including a speced us. When the man finished their shifts and return time, the toxins were shared with their wives and children through their clothes. At the urging of Lexus cousin who was doing well for himself as point Dan Henrietta moved with their babies to turn a station starting a new life.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Other cousins made the transition to including Henry edge as close friends. Saidi the city was a change for the axes, but they adjusted and they had fun. After cleaning, cooking and taking care of the Children Henry at are in CD, you would put on their dancing shoes and sneak out until the wee hours. The two women boogied laughed and had a great time and when they weren't dancing, Henrietta CD and CD's, sister Margaret Played Bingo in Henry at his living room. Turn the station was new and exciting, but Henry Assa preferred the country whenever she could. She rode the train back to clover to work in the fields or Chan barter on the home house porch. It was here. Uh, eldest daughter Elsie was most at ease. Elsie has inherited her mother's good looks, but she was born special, are unable to speak or talk. She made shops and core sounds like the birds and sometimes flailed her arms in front of her face.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Years later it was understood that Elsie had epilepsy and cognitive developmental delays that left her unable to communicate. No one knew what was going on in a pretty hat that's home in Turner station. Lc was known to occasionally run out into the streets screaming. By the time Henry [inaudible], who was pregnant with her fifth baby, Elsie had grown stronger and this made it near impossible for her mother to take care of fat to make life easier. Doctors recommended Henrietta commit LC to the Crownsville state hospital, formerly the hospital for the Negro insane, believing the doctors knew best. Henry as an institutionalized, how daughter years later, a family member said apart of Henry as a dye of the day, she left LC at Crownsville. Henry asset routinely visited her daughter once a week at the hospital before she became ill. After Henry as a died, no one ever went to Crownsville to CLC again.

Speaker 1:          08:16          Henry. I said with certain there was something wrong with her. A year and a half before a official cervical cancer diagnosis, she shared her worry with her cousins CD and Margaret saying there was a knot inside and explaining how it hurts something awful when that man wants to get with me. Sweet Jesus aren't them, but some pains who were then poked to her stomach over and over and felt nothing. Maybe it was a baby growing inside. They suggest it to be sure that nothing was seriously wrong. How cousins tried to convince Henrietta to see a doctor, but she didn't. And about a week later, Henry out, so found out she was pregnant. The ladies reassured her that it was just the maybe making it feel funny, but Henrietta wasn't convinced. Nevertheless, she didn't us out with Sadie and Margaret's again and it's the women never mentioned the conversation with anyone else.

Speaker 1:          09:00          Henry as a carries her fifth baby determined after Joe was born, she wasn't feeling any better. One a alone in the bathroom. She slipped into the bathtub and reached inside herself. She could feel the not until day she needed to go and see a doctor on a referral from the local physician, Henry, as he went to Johns Hopkins Hospital to see cancers. At this point, a Henry as a fault. The doctors would simply fix her right up on January the 29th 1951 day drove Henrietta with the three small children 20 miles from town of station to Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins was not any the hospital. It was a renowned medical research center. It also had a public water serving patients who were too poor to afford treatments, many of whom were black in the 1950s and to discriminatory segregation laws in the United States. Black patients could be turned away at hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics that soft white patients.

Speaker 1:          09:46          Sometimes the consequences are dire, including death. Johns Hopkins was Henry at his best and only real option for diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer while day sat in the car with their small children waiting for Henry. After to return, she met Dr. Howard Jones, the gynecologist on duty in the exam room. He reviewed her medical history and listened to Henrietta. Describe the lump that she felt insider when Jones examined her, he found a hard mass about the size of a nickel. The tumor was the color of grape jello exactly in the spot. Henrietta said it would be decades later in his nineties Joan's recalled never seeing anything like Henry his tumor during his years practicing medicine, not before and not since. During the exam, Dr. Jones caught a tiny sample of the tumor to test and it's confirmed what he suspected was cancerous. Then he sent Henry as a backhoe into town to station to await the results. Jones thought it was odd that Henry has a heard, had a full term baby just a few months prior with no notes mentioning the tumor or any abnormalities of the cervix listed in her chart. It was unlikely physicians would have missed seeing it, which meant it must've grown at an alarming rate. A few days later, Henrietta received the results back from the lab epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix. Stage one

Speaker 1:          11:08          in 1951 it was standard practice. You conduct research on public ward hospital. Patients without consent, explicit permission or informed consent from patients wasn't a term that was coined and so no legal or ethical standard existed in the United States for obtaining it. That's Hopkins, the den leading cervical cancer experts in the worlds and it's Dr. Jones, his boss Richard to Lynn's believed that since the patients were treated free of charge, the research was a form of payment for the hospital services. When Henrietta when's in for an exam, a sample from Henry out, his Chuma was sent to George Gaze lab that of tissue culture research at Hopkins. Without our knowledge for years, gay had been trying unsuccessfully to grow and keep alive human cells outside of the body in petri dishes. Culturing cells allowed scientists to test their response to all kinds of drugs, diseases, and conditions in order to do understand how the human body would react.

Speaker 1:          11:57          The benefit of this was that it didn't cause any harm to the patients. When Henry Su went to Hopkins and agreement was already in place to provide gaze research lab with patients, cancerous tumor samples primarily to be used in studies to prove to Lynn's theories to lens was a believer that of the two types of cervical cancer, the noninvasive variety carcinoma in situ could spreads and has become deadly. This was contrary to what the majority of researchers thought at the time, and physicians practices followed this conclusion, treating only the invasive cancers aggressively. He actually had another motive for his research using cells to, so Lindsey wanted to reduce the number of unjustifiable hysterectomy by detecting what wasn't cervical cancer at all. The Pap smear test you use to identify changes to a woman's cervical cells was developed only a decade earlier, but few physicians could interpret the results and treat patients accordingly in extreme cases.

Speaker 1:          12:48          So women who just needed a few antibiotics declare up a minor infection. Might've had a entire uterus removed in a surgical procedure. When Gaze lab assistant Mary received Henrietta's tissue sample. She had every reason to believe the cells if they lived at all would die within a few days. She was eating lunch and decided to finish a sandwich first. So far, even with gay standards, meticulous process and emphasis on sterilization is lap. Had little success with growing human cells. When Mary got to work on Henry at has cancer cells, she carefully and precisely sliced the samples with steady hands, makes the media the cells would need to grow and labeled them healer for the first two letters of Henrietta's first and last names. Then she left them alone, not really expecting very much. By the next morning to marry, surprise, Henrietta cells had divided and in the days ahead he looked, kept making copies of themselves. They grew unlike any cells before and expanded into as much space as Mary would give them. Gay was ecstatic because the cells were growing like crabgrass and soon among researchers. Word was out about the amazing healer cells. Everyone knew the implications for furthering biomedical research and this was gays goal. See, when he began sending he the cells, do any scientist interested in using them for that own studies?

Speaker 1:          14:12          Henry has his treatment for cervical cancer was radium or radioactive metal that glows blue in this highly toxic in the early 20th century. Upon radiums discovery, it was hailed as a miracle to cure all kinds of elements. Now, Radian does kill cancer cells, but it can burn skin from a person's body if it's given in high enough quantities being radioactive radium. It also causes cancer. In 1951 the radium treatment for cervical cancer involved placing tubes inside the patient's next to the affected area. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, weakness, and anemia. If Henry has experienced any of these, she didn't let on or seem sick. A tall after treatment started. Henrietta, finally the same cousins. She confided in about the knots inside out. She didn't want anyone to worry, but the frequent visits to Johns Hopkins would mean she would be away and it's people would certainly wonder.

Speaker 1:          15:01          Initially the radium treatments seemed to work and doctors recorded. The tumor is having vanished. As therapy progressed, Henry, it didn't feel any better and to her horror, her abdomen turned from soft brown to black as coal. One day she lifted up her shirt and showed CD and Margaret's and said it felt as though the blackness be spreading more than inside. The radium treatments didn't cure Henrietta's cancer. By the fall of 1951 her body was full of tms and a diaphragm, bladder, cervix, kidneys, lungs, and it was all causing her excruciating pain. She Land Better Johns Hopkins and screamed out like it was the devil of pain itself between the treatments and the cancer. Henrietta was weak and our kidneys when no longer flushing out dangerous toxins in their blood. She had to receive numerous transfusions. The doctors tried different medications to ease their suffering, including morphine, which didn't even touch the pain on one desperate attempt.

Speaker 1:          15:52          The doctors even injected alcohol into our spine, but nothing seemed to work. All anyone could do was sit beside her bed and pray. Henry has to to Gladys, was it a bad side? The night she succumbed to cancer, knowing her time had come, Henrietta made her sister promised to take care of our kids and whispered through tears. Don't you let anything bad happen to them children when I'm gone at 12:15 AM on October the fourth 1951 Henrietta lacks took her last breath and died in a hospital bed. Nobody was sent back to clover and it's buried in the family plots in an unmarked grave next to a mother.

Speaker 1:          16:36          The importance of Henrietta cells cannot be overstated through this immortalized continuously cultured Cell Line Cancer Research has advanced vaccines have been developed. Gene, nothing has taken place and treatments of various diseases have been studied and other taken. He [inaudible] have even been put into space on missions with both Americans and Russians were tested against an atomic bomb and where the first human cells to be cloned, perhaps the most well known advances using Hela cells occurred shortly after Henry at his death in the midst of a polio epidemic. The virus was sweeping the country and it's parents feared for the lives of their children. In late summer dubbed polio season, public swimming pools were shut down and officials warms. The virus could be spread by sitting too close to others. At movie theaters. By 1950 to 60,000 children were in fact there's thousands or paralyzed. A vaccine was in developments by Jonas Salk that he needed a way to test it in a lab on a grand scale before injecting children heal provided the perfect opportunity.

Speaker 1:          17:34          Soon the healer project at Tuskegee university began growing the cell line employing mostly black women, lab technicians, Tuskegee's, mass production of healer would serve as the first of its kind and just help launched a multibillion dollar industry. When the first commercial culture operation began using Tuskegee's model in an old fritos factory in Bethesda, Maryland. While this groundbreaking biomedical research was taking place, only a handful of people could trace the healers cell line origins back to a poor 31 year old black women with cervical cancer two decades would pass before the name Henrietta lacks was finally released to the public.

Speaker 2:          18:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:19          For many years, members of the lacks family never knew how Henry has his cells were used to advance medical research. Indeed, when her name was released to the public, many questions where it's still left unanswered. The children, especially her daughter Deborah, were too young to remember. Her mother runs long to know what she was like, what her favorite color was, and whether or not she breastfed her not knowing, not understanding how my mother's cells could still be living after our death was terrifying and cost the family great anxiety and pain and sons and husbands day. We're mostly angry with Johns Hopkins. The doctors and George Gay Day never gave the hospital permission to use. His wife sells and it didn't seem right or fair that people were making millions of dollars from selling them by members of the family, couldn't even afford health insurance. Hopkins has made public statements that the hospital has never done regularly profited from Hilo runs at the time.

Speaker 1:          19:08          No federal regulations were in place for obtaining permission to use Henrietta cells for research. A book published in 2010 by Walter Rebecca Skloot and to movie starring Oprah Winfrey has recently brought greater attention to the women behind the immortal Hela cells, raising ethical questions for the well to ponder for now over 60 years after her death, Henrietta [inaudible] cells live on and just continue to provide us with in measurable value in the fight to cure and eradicate disease. For that we can be grateful. And now we know a little bit more about the woman Henrietta lacks. So I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.
