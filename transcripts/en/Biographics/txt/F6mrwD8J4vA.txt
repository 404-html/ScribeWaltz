Speaker 1:          00:00          He is the worldwide symbol of rebellion and revolutionary struggle. His silhouette is familiar to billions representing the epitome of cool antiestablishment ism. Yet few people know the real story behind the legends of Che Guevara and in this week's biographics we discover the man behind the myth to reveal an individual whose passion for social justice so are no bounds

Speaker 1:          00:36          and let's do it. Guevara Della Center was born on June the 14th 1928 and the town of Rosario Ivan, Tina. It's family was aristocratic with his father when Nestor Guevara Lynch operating construction and ship building businesses born premature Levy Infants Guevara who sued, acquired the nickname che struggled with asthma as well as pneumonia. His mother was the dominant figure in his life, teaching him to read and write and impressing her belief in social justice upon him. Jay was the oldest of five children. The family were exposed to a wide range of political and philosophical thoughts with his father being friendly with many veterans of the Spanish civil war. The boy develops a strong interest in sport at selling as athletics, swimming, and rugby. He was known for his aggressive style of play and the mental drive to push his body to the limit. Jay also develops a passion for intellectual pursuits.

Speaker 1:          01:31          By the age of 10 he had become a very good chess player in the veracious reader. I think Avara home was overflowing with books on a wide range of subject six supposing him to the ideas of men like Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Friedrich Engels k also showed a great love for poetry and his early teens. Che's interest in the philosophies of great thinkers of the past that didn't to keep a personal journal in which he would summarize their main ideas as he formulated his own outlook on life at school chain. He was confident and determined a school nature men button as incredibly sure of himself and totally independent in his opinions, very dynamic, restless, and unconventional. He acted more maturely than many of his peers and associates. While I'm still in high school. He surrounded himself with university students proving to be the intellectual equal and showing a political insight that often even surpass bears.

Speaker 1:          02:26          On one occasion, his university pals edge DMZ join them in a political rally. He replies, go out in the streets so the police can hit us with their clubs, nothing doing. I'll go and demonstrate only if you give me a gun. In later life. Guevara made their comments. That was certainly the case for himself and then of 15 already knows what he wants to die for and he is not afraid of giving his life if he has found an ideal which makes the sacrifice easy. At Age 15 Guevara ideal was still in a raw state consisting us. We're more of a passion for equality for all and a rejection of materialism. Still at this age, he was more interested in sports and politics. You impressed everyone with this fierce self-discipline. His ass man made it a challenge for him to stay on the rugby fields, but he saw his condition as a barrier of it could be overcome with sheer force of will chase self-discipline translated to his academic life as well. After graduating from high school, he completed a six year university medical degree in just three years. His aunt later recalled. We would listen to him gasping, studying as he lay on the floor to ease his breathing, but he never complains for him. There was a challenge,

Speaker 1:          03:48          jade, again, his university studies at the University of when us Aries and 1948 at the age of 20 he refused to involve himself with the political movements against the Peruvian government staying focused on his studies. He founds its rasping from academia on the back of his 500 CC Norton motorcycle, which he nicknames lap Ponderosa meaning the mighty one. Yeah, it's chase. First major excursion was actually on the back of a bicycle, one that he had fitted a small motor team in 1950 he embarks on a solo track across northern Argentina that would see in pedaling some 2,800 miles a year later, he paired up with a university friends, Alberto Grenada for a massive motorcycle track across the South American continents. The two men traveled from one location to another finding work as laborers as they went at some pub. Lou, they volunteered to work in a leper colony. It was here. Let's give our recalled.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Seeing the most impressive example of solidarity and loyalty, and this was among men who had nothing materially. He was also deeply affected by the intense poverty that he saw in every corner of the continents. In his minds, this was an indictment of the feeling capitalist system throughout the 5,000 mile excursion Guevara. I kept a journal in which he recorded his experiences. These were later published as a book which was entitled the Motorcycle Diaries in the 1990s the motorcycle journey proved to be a great turning points in Guevaras life in 1960 he wrote the following because of the conditions in which I traveled. I came into close contact with poverty and hunger and disease. I discovered that I was unable to cure sick children through lack of means, and they saw the degradation of under nourishment and constant repression. In this way. I began to realize that there was another thing that was as important as being a famous researcher or making a great contribution to medical science, and that was to help people, his experiences over the course of his travels. Also, it proven to Guevara that he could exist. On very little. He had the ability to push himself forward despite food, water, sleep or anything materially these qualities, what to make him an extremely effective guerilla fighter Guevara and taken a year sabbatical from his university degree to embark upon his attic journey returning. He threw himself into his studies graduating in 1953 to officially become a doctor two months later, however, he abandons this career and stepped into the political arena

Speaker 1:          06:18          with another friends, Carlos for rec. Avara headed for Bolivia. The country had just come under his first reformed governments. The big issue was the nationalization of the countries. 10 lines or revolution was forming, but che refused to be drawn in stating that the revolutionaries were not concerned with addressing the causes of injustice, but we're merely tinkering with the effects rejecting the revolutionary movements in Bolivia. Jay and Carlos headed for Peru. Yeah. They found that they were unable to open any kinds of communication with the down fraud, an Indian Sioux according to Farrah standards, lips as tight and for bidding as a vice that refuse to to reply to our questions. Still the Peruvian border guards web. Sure. That the two foreign upstarts sweat forming some sort of agrarian revolution from Peru. They traveled to Guatemala. Yeah, I revolution had just taken pace. Jay have not yet fully developed a Marxist philosophy, but he felt a personal responsibility to help the downtrodden.

Speaker 1:          07:16          His challenge was to find a workable way in order to do this, the new revolutionary government in Guatemala, it was led by Hacobo Arbenz who had managed to pull together a group of young army officers and intellectuals. As Jay arrived on the scene, I'll, this was in the process of redistributing lands that had been nationalized from the American United Fruit company. That hasn't work. It's the ever present. Fear was that this would provoke a counterrevolution revolution that would be backed by the Americans. Jay wanted to work as a doctor for the Guatemalans in the jungles of Bhutan. However, he would be required to join the Guatemalan Labour party, which was another name for the local communist party. She refuse to join painting that he was a revolutionary and that that designation superseded any political affiliations of the Arbenz government only lasted a year due to the fear and American intervention becoming a reality.

Speaker 1:          08:07          The CIA trained and finance day revolution, regrouping, managed, do you asked the sitting government courts in the middle of it all was Che Guevara who commented, and we are like the Spanish republic betrayed from within and without, but we did not for with the same dignity. Finally, he committed himself to revolution reaction. Yet despite his best efforts, he could not rally the Guatemalan people for a consolidated defense. In the ends. Arbenz weekly resigned. She had been marked for execution by the incoming regime and was forced to flee to the Argentinian embassy where he was holed up for almost two months. His experiences in Guatemala Convinced Chafe at America was the great enemy of worldwide freedom and that capitalism was holding people in a state of subjugation. It was at this point is that he began to seriously study the of Marx and Lenin from Argentina Che made from Mexico where he began to develop his skills as a revolutionary. In 1955 he met Fidel Castro, who had been exiled from Cuba after a failed coup, Castro was actively looking for revolutionaries do join a second attempt to overthrow the regime of full Henslow. Battista shaved like 20 herds and he enthusiastically signed up.

Speaker 1:          09:23          The Cuban revolutionaries hadn't even left Mexican show us when they were intercepted by Mexican intelligence services and thrown in prison. It was Jay's first experience of incarceration, the screens of his fellow inmates as they were being beaten and immersed in water. It had a powerful impact on Castro, though he was able to exert influence through the Russian embassy that got all of the men released from 1956 the small band of men were undergoing guerrilla warfare training on the Rancho San Miguel Halco. Che proved to be the outstanding students among the group despite his ever present asthma, the att revolutionaries, they sit out for Cuba. On November the 25th 1956 on board a dilapidated yacht called grandma. None of the men onboard. We're sailors and they all got seasick with most of the suppliers being lost in a storm. They finally landed in a swampy area that led to a mountain range in the south east of Cuba for the next few weeks.

Speaker 1:          10:17          They wandered around somewhat aimlessly. They found a guide, but he betrayed them to Battista's forces. The rebels were surrounded as they lounged around in the jungle with their boots off and weapons laid aside in the ensuing fast on all but 12 of Castro's man, they were wiped out. Castro, he was wounded in the neck, but he managed to escape with four of his comrades. In doing so, he had to make a fateful choice of this. He later wrote. This was perhaps the first time I had to choose between my education for medicine and my duty as a revolutionary soldier. As my feet were a pack full of medicines and the cartridge box together, they were too heavy to carry. I chose the cartridge box leaving behind the Madsen pack. J led his group to the Sierra, my strat and meet up with any other survivors.

Speaker 1:          11:02          He used what he thought was the north star to guide him, but it was actually another star runs. The group got hopelessly lost. They eventually arrived at the meeting place. By sheer luck for the next few weeks, the man had to rely on the generosity of local peasants just to survive. It was a small victory in the group struggle to enlarge their numbers as they settled into life in the Sierra Maestra Mountains, though few peasants join the rebellion, they did build up a network of sympathizes and he, he showed any signs of allegiance to the Patista. Governments were put to death often on the orders of Guevara. It was during this time that chain develops the cold ruthlessness that he felt was necessary to the makeup of a revolutionary over the next two years. He was to order the deaths of hundreds of Patista followers by May of 1957 the guerrilla force said the rebuilt to about 80 men and they had built a sizeable cache of weapons they overcame than other army barracks sins.

Speaker 1:          11:56          Before long. The entire Sierra Maestra region has become a liberated zone, whether he's does forces fear to go during this time, that red alarm, he had transformed itself from something of a clueless mob to an actual season to guerrilla force. This was almost entirely due to the training and the guidance of Che Guevara. Castro had made him a commandant second in rank only to himself as well as training the men in fighting tactics. He also established a field hospital, the tailor's shop bakery, and a printing shop. You've are also set up a radio station so that the rebels could speak directly to the peasant population. As a result of his prominent work at the core of the red alarm egg Avara, his name came to the attention of the authorities being mentioned in the same breath as the Castro brothers as an enemy of the state within the group.

Speaker 1:          12:44          He also gone at his own loyal following and in time he would become a threat to Fidel himself. By the end of autumn 1958 the rebel force had one, a series of victories in the south of Cuba. This precipitated Che's Long March towards Havana during which is small but determined forced travel by night and attack to the villages and towns that they encountered along the way during the day. The ultimate objective was to gain control of the province of last vs effectively cutting Cuba and half. Che proved himself to be a brilliant tactician. He perfected the art of setting up a rule base is expanding them until a town fell and then isolating cities and squeezing the resistance sounds of it. The final attack on the provinces Capitol of Santa Clara involved a suicide squad attack that soar as men outnumbered 10 to one the victory that resulted was the most decisive battle in the entire revolution with a rebel victory at Santa Clara and the rebels heading for the Capitol for Hensdale. Battista knew the game was up. He abandoned the country, and on the 1st of January, 1959 headed for the Dominican Republic with an alleged fortune of $300 million. The next day, Jay enter Devonna like a conquering hero. Fidel the rive. Six days later to proclaim there's a new era had begun.

Speaker 1:          14:05          The men who now inherited the governments of Cuba where predominantly uneducated and ill prepared for the task. The clear exception was Che Guevara. While he had no direct governmental experience, he was a university graduates who were steeped in philosophical thought. Further during the time in the mountains, he had proven his ability to organize Madden. Surely organizing a country wouldn't be much more difficult. As a result, she became the brains of the new governments for the next six years. He remained in Cuba implementing his own form of guerrilla governments. His first focus was to shift Cuba from an agrarian to an industrial society. In order to become independent from foreign imperialists, Cuba had to become self sufficient. J spoke less about the peasantry and more about the urban worker. In 1961 he was appointed minister of Industry and instituted a program of converting agricultural implements into raw materials.

Speaker 1:          15:00          Too many people by such policies chain, he was deserted. The peasant class shape never appreciated the complexity and its financial resources that we needed to set up new industries. The factories that resulted ended up producing goods that were of low quality and high price. By the end of 1964 Guevara had established himself as an international expert on revolution reaction. During a three month world tour. He visited China, North Korea, Algiers, Ghana, Tanzania, and a few other countries espousing his anticapitalist ideology and claiming that the Cuban revolution was something spiritual that would transcend all boarders. At the beginning of 1965 Guevara went to the Congo to lend his support to the revolutionary struggle there for seven months. He lands in Afro Cuban force of about a hundred men. However, his movements were constantly monitored by the Kongo national army and the American CIA and he was unable to make any traction.

Speaker 1:          16:02          After spending time in Exxon at the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam, Jay quietly returned to Cuba. Then in October, 1966 he slipped into Bolivia that he believed that he could ferment an uprising that would lead to the eventual overthrow of imperialism throughout all of Latin America during his time in Bolivia Guevara cabs, a detailed daily account of his experiences which had been published as the Bolivian diaries via count reveals that the specter of death was ever presence. Though it is clear that he didn't go to Bolivia wanting to get killed, he was well aware for the odds of emerging from the struggle alive were slim at best. J and the Cubans who came with him were not welcomed with open arms by fee Bolivian revolutionaries. The Bolivian Indians, they distrusted the Cubans as foreign white men. As a result during the entire 11 months, Che was unable to recruit a single Bolivian Indian too is cause Jay divided his small rebel group into two divisions.

Speaker 1:          16:59          He likes the decisiveness and degression of the actions that he had during the Cuban revolution. He was also suffering physically at this point with his asthmatic bounce, becoming chronic, still his resolve to go on and never wanes as long as he could breathe. You could fight. Each rebel division was systematically hunted down by the Bolivian forces. On October the seventh 1967 and informants led Bolivian special forces troops to Castries camp in the euro ravine. Almost 2000 soldiers surrounded the camp and moved in for the kill ball, but 10 men were killed. Guevara throw up his hands and he yelled, do not shoot. I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive and debt. They were into. Jay was captured bounds and taken to a nearby school house. Attempts to interrogate and failed. As he refused to speak. One of the Bolivian soldiers present recalled that Jay held his head high, looked very one straight in the eye and asked only for something to smoke.

Speaker 1:          17:53          A pipe was handed to j and d contently puffed on it until they Bolivian officer entered the room and grabbed it from his mouth. In response Guevara kicked out at the officer on the morning of October, the Ninth Guevara requested an audience with the local school teacher. The young woman was summons and she listened respectfully. As Che brought our attention to the dilapidated condition of a school room and contrasted it to the lavish conditions which government officials enjoyed. He told her that is what he was fighting for, the teacher Judy Cortez liter related, that she could not meet Che's gays because it was unbearable piercing and so tranquil Zune. The news came through the Bolivian President Renée baryons Os had ordered the death of Che Guevara before the execution. The soldiers paraded him outside the school room and took photos with them. Then it was taken back inside.

Speaker 1:          18:41          Whereas execution or entered Guevara stood as he spoke the last words to his killer. I know you've come to kill me, shoot coward, you are only going to kill a man. The assassin, a soldier named Mario Tara and then opened fire hitting che and the arms and legs. He was careful to inflict wounds in such a way that the story could be told that che was killed during a firefight. The revolutionary icon was pronounced dead at 1:10 PM on October the ninth 1968 the manner of his death created a mater of the substance of his life, created a legend as strong today as it ever was.
