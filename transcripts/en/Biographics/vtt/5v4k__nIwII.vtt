44
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>began the gradual process of unification that would lead to the creation of</v>

<v Speaker 1>modern day Spain.</v>

<v Speaker 1>lot of time in Segovia and s with doc and Marta having established quite a</v>

50
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:44.530

51
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>he was retained as how confessor at first he declined to accepts the offer that</v>

52
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>was won over by the princesses insistence.</v>

55
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Isabella and talking about it,</v>

56
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>they were both obsessed with rooting out religious heresy and the purity of the</v>

57
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

58
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Both the queen and husband's King Fudge and atoms had a high opinion of the</v>

59
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>humble priest and he was quickly promoted within the order.</v>

60
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>If he had been ambitious,</v>

61
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>he may have ascended to a cause,</v>

62
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>an oil ship like his uncle,</v>

63
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>even to the office of Pope.</v>

64
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>But talking about,</v>

65
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>he had no such lofty intentions.</v>

67
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>He was content's to live the life of a simple monk.</v>

68
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>In May of 1475,</v>

69
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the Portuguese invaded Spain and it attempts to seize the crown away from</v>

70
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Isabella and Ferdinand's.</v>

71
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>A bloody war was waged familia year culminating in the Spanish victory at the</v>

72
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.510
<v Speaker 1>battle of Toro on March the first 1476 in the wake of this great victory is</v>

73
00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>about a road around the countryside holding court in every town that she came</v>

74
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 1>across as she would hear complaints about murderers,</v>

75
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.251
<v Speaker 1>thieves,</v>

76
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>and other wrongdoers using her authority as Monique to fast track judicial</v>

77
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

78
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>She would order the guilty to either be short or beheaded immediately.</v>

79
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>This she did with a cold and clinical and precision,</v>

80
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>not this time token Mata was busy with organizing the construction of a new</v>

81
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Dominican monastery.</v>

82
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.963
<v Speaker 1>At a villa.</v>

83
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Jews had been living in Spain for some 1,500 years with about 80,000 of them.</v>

84
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>At the time Isabella was queen.</v>

85
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>This was compared to some 6 million Christians.</v>

86
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Unlike France and England's,</v>

87
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish had not expelled the Jews,</v>

88
00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>but they had forced many of them to convert to Christianity.</v>

89
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>These were the ones who were known as convert Zos.</v>

90
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Many within the realm,</v>

91
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:35.911
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

92
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:40.020
<v Speaker 1>did not put any stock in the Christian sincerity of the conveyor Zos.</v>

93
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>They were believed to be false converts who practice their own Jewish religion</v>

94
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:45.600
<v Speaker 1>while professing Christianity.</v>

95
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>This was seen by many in positions of power of direct threat to the security of</v>

96
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:54.240
<v Speaker 1>the realm in general and to the church in particular in the eyes of the queen.</v>

97
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 1>This faith amounted to Paris.</v>

98
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>He and it was something that she simply would not tolerate.</v>

99
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

100
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>she would not put up with any form of religious hypocrisy.</v>

101
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.760
<v Speaker 1>It was during a visit to Seville and 1477 that she first became interested in</v>

102
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 1>adopting an inquisition or investigation into the religious state of the</v>

103
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>kingdom.</v>

104
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.591
<v Speaker 1>The following year,</v>

105
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>a papal bull was issued by pope six does the fourth granting permission to</v>

106
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:19.890
<v Speaker 1>establish an inquisition within Castiel.</v>

107
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>The petitions of the pipe requesting the inquisition had been written by talking</v>

108
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Mada and Cardinal Mendoza,</v>

109
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>but Isabella,</v>

110
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.900
<v Speaker 1>she moved cautiously.</v>

111
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 1>She was of the opinion that poor training was the main reason that Jewish</v>

112
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:33.930
<v Speaker 1>converts when not fully adhering to the faith.</v>

113
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And so she put the emphasis on religious education.</v>

114
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>The queen appointed two of them.</v>

115
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Most trusted church advises Cardinal Mendoza and the future archbishop of</v>

116
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Granada and Nando de Talavera to the task of reeducating the way it would</v>

117
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:46.721
<v Speaker 1>converse.</v>

118
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>So a program was put in place in Seville by which local priests would retrain</v>

119
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Speaker 1>the misguided converses.</v>

120
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.100
<v Speaker 1>But after two years with very little headway being made,</v>

121
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Isabella had concede that stronger measures when needed,</v>

122
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>she remains reluctance to enact the inquisition.</v>

123
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>But pressure came upon her from her advisors,</v>

124
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>including talking Marta to do so.</v>

125
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Even her husband,</v>

126
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>King Ferdinand was in favor of the pragmatist.</v>

127
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>He foresaw the confiscation of conversa property has a much needed revenue</v>

128
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>gathering source for the state.</v>

129
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.811
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

130
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and against her better judgment.</v>

131
00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Isabella are issued a royal decree on September the 27 1480 establishing the</v>

132
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>tribunal of the Holy Office of the inquisition.</v>

133
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>The Papal Bull authorizing the acquisition had given us a better and Fudge</v>

134
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Nan's,</v>

135
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>the freedom to select the members who made up the inquisition tribunals.</v>

136
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>They chose Tamasic talking and along with college nor Mendoza and two other</v>

137
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Dominicans,</v>

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It took the position of chief judge while talking.</v>

141
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Mata took the position of consulting x spat the other two members where the</v>

142
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>active inquisitor's who sought out and it's brought heretics before the</v>

143
00:06:59.001 --> 00:06:59.834
<v Speaker 1>tribunal.</v>

144
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.870
<v Speaker 1>The first area of focus for the inquisition was the almost entirely Jewish city</v>

145
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
<v Speaker 1>of Seville.</v>

146
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 1>The arrival living twisters dressed in distinctive white robes and black hoods</v>

147
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>caused panic among the conversa community.</v>

148
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>With around 4,000 people fleeing Savelle,</v>

149
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>still the inquisitors set about their work with ruthless efficiency.</v>

150
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>The first public execution took place on February the sixth 1481 on that day,</v>

151
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>six people were burned to death setting the stage for the horror that was to</v>

152
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>unfold over the coming months and years from Seville.</v>

153
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 1>The inquisition spread throughout the kingdom with tribunals set up in Cordoba,</v>

154
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

155
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And to the religious Capitol of Toledo.</v>

156
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>A passing was soon established,</v>

157
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>would begin with the people of a town being prepared by having the fear of God</v>

158
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 1>preached to them from the pulpit.</v>

159
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Then the inquisitors would arrive in the town and the edict of grace would be</v>

160
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>red.</v>

161
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 1>This was a cool to come forth and confess your lack of faith.</v>

162
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Those who did so and renounced their Judaism.</v>

163
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Good Hope for mercy.</v>

164
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Those who didn't would face the full wrath of the inquisitor's.</v>

165
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Those who were taken into detention would have all of their property taken away</v>

166
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>

167
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>This would obviously leave their family and a hopeless situation.</v>

168
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>The primary goal of the interrogators was to obtain a confession.</v>

169
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.841
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter if it came voluntary or if torture had to be used to extract</v>

170
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

171
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Methods of torture progressed from foot roasting in which the suspect's fees,</v>

172
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>well loved and fashion than held over a burning fire to the Judas cradle.</v>

173
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>A device composed of a tall,</v>

174
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>thin stool with a triangular shaped seat in which the victim was sodium pails.</v>

175
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the rack,</v>

176
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>in which case the victim was tied to a wooden frame and their body was stretched</v>

177
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>as the ball's moved in opposite directions.</v>

178
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Such torture would convince even the most innocent of people to confess.</v>

179
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Still subject coerced confession was not legally binding.</v>

180
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It had to be afterwards confirmed by the suspect for it to hold any weight.</v>

181
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 1>The trial that was held would be the defendants only opportunity to defend</v>

182
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>himself if he was able to,</v>

183
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>he would call upon witnesses to prove his innocence or to cast doubt upon the</v>

184
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>voracity of the accuser.</v>

185
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.391
<v Speaker 1>If found guilty,</v>

186
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 1>the person could be reconciled or pennants if they demonstrated can triteness,</v>

187
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>they would lose all their property and have to undergo such punishments is</v>

188
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.890
<v Speaker 1>whipping or a term of imprisonment.</v>

189
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Those who refuse to denounce Judaism would be condemned to the flames.</v>

190
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>The inquisition created an atmosphere of fear throughout the kingdom.</v>

191
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>One of its most chilling aspects was that it thrived on a diet of anonymous</v>

192
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.034
<v Speaker 1>accusation.</v>

193
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Then when the suspect who was forced to confess,</v>

194
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>he was required to produce names of others who had been co-conspirators with</v>

195
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

196
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.550
<v Speaker 1>By 1483 the inquisition had become a monster that was completely out of control.</v>

197
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Isabella's initial goal was simply to weed out the false converts among the</v>

198
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>conversion of Jews,</v>

199
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>but the climate of accusation and torture had led to something far,</v>

200
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>far more sinister with no centralized control.</v>

201
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>The various tribunals around the kings and were operating according to their own</v>

202
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:53.964
<v Speaker 1>dictates.</v>

203
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.690
<v Speaker 1>News was constantly being received by the pope in Rome of accesses that when's B</v>

204
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>owns the powers that he had given it as papal bull.</v>

205
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>This call was tension between the Pope and queen is about in order to settle the</v>

206
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.241
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

207
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Isabella tend to hire advisors at Thomas did Torquemada.</v>

208
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It was decided that all the powers of the inquisition would be decentralized</v>

209
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>with token WMATA himself at the hat.</v>

210
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 1>He had the skills and experience it was believed to please both of a Monique and</v>

211
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>the pope at the same time.</v>

212
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 1>The pope of greed stands in October of 1483 he names talking Marta.</v>

213
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>The inquisitor general of Castiel and the owner.</v>

214
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:35.971
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>

215
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:37.960
<v Speaker 1>the history's painting him as an ego,</v>

216
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.130
<v Speaker 1>persecutor of Jews.</v>

217
00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:41.230
<v Speaker 1>He was chomping at the bits to torture them.</v>

218
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.950
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that talk Amada would rather not have taken up the position.</v>

219
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.760
<v Speaker 1>He would have preferred to continue to live the simple life of a monk.</v>

220
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

221
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.740
<v Speaker 1>having accepted the position,</v>

222
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.610
<v Speaker 1>he did take it on with full force knots with the goal of persecuting the Jews</v>

223
00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:54.791
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

224
00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but ensuring that all Catholics were true as loyal Catholics.</v>

225
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 1>He's all the inquisition,</v>

226
00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>not as an instrument of crew Tara,</v>

227
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but as a vehicle for necessary reform talk a Marta began his oversight of the</v>

228
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:11.650
<v Speaker 1>inquisition by doing a way with the worst excesses of his predecessors,</v>

229
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.290
<v Speaker 1>putting in place a system of judicial process.</v>

230
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.890
<v Speaker 1>He then improve the conditions for people who were imprisoned under the</v>

231
00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:18.640
<v Speaker 1>inquisition.</v>

232
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.121
<v Speaker 1>Talk about,</v>

233
00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:19.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.280
<v Speaker 1>next set about refining veep.</v>

235
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Stages of the inquisition process.</v>

236
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.490
<v Speaker 1>The edict of grace would be read up to three times into period of 40 days given</v>

237
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.470
<v Speaker 1>for repentant ones to come forward.</v>

238
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.220
<v Speaker 1>A person could only be convicted on the testimony of two witnesses.</v>

239
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And now the complaints had to be in writing and they had to be signed.</v>

240
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Once a person was denounced by two witnesses,</v>

241
00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:42.100
<v Speaker 1>he would be investigated usually without his knowledge.</v>

242
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.480
<v Speaker 1>If evidence of false religious worship was clear and specific,</v>

243
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.150
<v Speaker 1>the person would be put before the court talk.</v>

244
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Amada required that a person's trial must be held within three days of his.</v>

245
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.340
<v Speaker 1>The charges against him would be state.</v>

246
00:11:55.341 --> 00:11:55.661
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>

247
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>He would be urged to confess to his gills if he refused up to two more hearings</v>

248
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>would be held only after the third hearing with the interrogation begin talk on</v>

249
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Mars and produced a handbook to help his inquisitors do identify heretical</v>

250
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>converses giveaway signs of their heresy where such things as cooking all their</v>

251
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>meals for the weekend on a Friday night if they got their supplies from Jewish</v>

252
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>rather than Kristy and suppliers,</v>

253
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>and if they were known not to eat pork just by the fact that his name has been</v>

254
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 1>forever linked with the worst excesses of the inquisitions torture processes.</v>

255
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that talk Amada was responsible for mitigating the worst excesses</v>

256
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>of the process.</v>

257
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>He stipulated that it was not to be used as a means of punishment,</v>

258
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 1>but strictly for obtaining information related to the charge at hands.</v>

259
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

260
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>torture could only be administered with the recent approval of the bishop of the</v>

261
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>diocese and the visa of the Supreme Court.</v>

262
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.311
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

263
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>the doctor had to be present throughout the torture process.</v>

264
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.211
<v Speaker 1>Talk about that.</v>

265
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Did away with some of the more barbarous methods of torture and replaced them</v>

266
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:58.390
<v Speaker 1>with what was known as the water care.</v>

267
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.200
<v Speaker 1>The interrogated person would be stripped naked and tied with cords.</v>

268
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Upon a wooden ladder.</v>

269
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 1>The nostrils stopped and his drawers were held apart by tongues.</v>

270
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Then a piece of linen was placed over his mouth.</v>

271
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Water was then slowly pour it onto the cloth to travel down the throat.</v>

272
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>The sensation that resulted was that one was suffocating.</v>

273
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>However it Randy resulted in long term.</v>

274
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Harmon's usually resulted in a confession being obtained talk,</v>

275
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Amada organized a Sonata,</v>

276

<v Speaker 1>the inquisitor's Seville during which she impressed upon the tribunal members</v>

277
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 1>his new rules.</v>

278
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.340
<v Speaker 1>He then convenes tribunals in old Jewish strongholds including Seville,</v>

279
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:33.941
<v Speaker 1>Cordoba,</v>

280
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:34.411
<v Speaker 1>Gian,</v>

281
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>and [inaudible]</v>

282
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 1>with the inquisition now and out and could still talk to Marta.</v>

283
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Now set about implementing is in Aragon.</v>

284
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.340
<v Speaker 1>This was a challenging assignment.</v>

285
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.100
<v Speaker 1>The gene is Helen.</v>

286
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of positions of power and these men were naturally resistance to the</v>

287
00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:54.861
<v Speaker 1>inquisition review.</v>

288
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

289
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.580
<v Speaker 1>the governor of Arizona and along with most of the judges and lawyers in the</v>

290
00:13:58.581 --> 00:14:00.200
<v Speaker 1>stage where all converges those,</v>

291
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.650
<v Speaker 1>they all banded together and opposition to the work of talking motto.</v>

292
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Still the chief inquisitive forged ahead.</v>

293
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.050
<v Speaker 1>They appointed two of his best men as inquisitors for Aragon.</v>

294
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Leaving is meant to it.</v>

295
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:13.430
<v Speaker 1>He then returned to focus on carrying out the inquisition and Castiel.</v>

296
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

297
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Jewish leaders in both states,</v>

298
00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:18.080
<v Speaker 1>we're organizing an opposition to the inquisition.</v>

299
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.540
<v Speaker 1>A great campaign for democracy was launched,</v>

300
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.390
<v Speaker 1>two monks web centre Cordoba to besiege the Queens,</v>

301
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:24.620
<v Speaker 1>but an end to the inquisition.</v>

302
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.020
<v Speaker 1>The men often large sums of money to the crown.</v>

303
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.740
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

304
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Isabella rejected all of their efforts.</v>

305
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Now desperate,</v>

306
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.670
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish leaders began to speak of assassinating the inquisitor's.</v>

307
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.810
<v Speaker 1>A group of prominent Jews met together and agreed to hire a gang of cutthroats</v>

308
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.430
<v Speaker 1>to carry out the assassinations.</v>

309
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.360
<v Speaker 1>They began by disposing of high ranking priests within the inquisition.</v>

310
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Father PTO abuse was kneeling in prayer before the blessed sacrament when a</v>

311
00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:50.750
<v Speaker 1>gangster crept in and stabbed him in the back,</v>

312
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>the and queen with outrage that this attack and twins all out to hunt down the</v>

313
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 1>people who are responsible,</v>

314
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the gang who had been employed to carry out the Giddings,</v>

315
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 1>they were rounded up and execute it.</v>

316
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.371
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

317
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 1>the death of the priest who had immediately been raised to st Jude lead to a</v>

318
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:06.760
<v Speaker 1>backlash against the conversion.</v>

319
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Any oppositions of the inquisition in Aragon now came to an end allowing talking</v>

320
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>about a free reign to bring the Jews there too is true faith in the course of</v>

321
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>his inquiries into the Jewish activity is talking about are uncovered a plot by</v>

322
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 1>converse,</v>

323
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:23.710
<v Speaker 1>a leaders in Toledo to seize control of the city during the 1485 Corpus Christi</v>

324
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Prosecution and murder or the leading Christians.</v>

325
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

326
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.080
<v Speaker 1>a large number of Jewish leaders are put to death</v>

327
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.590
<v Speaker 1>off to 12 years.</v>

328
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:41.310
<v Speaker 1>The inquisition had still not managed to stomp out of the Jewish heresy problem.</v>

329
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Talking motto was of the belief that the reason that the conversa is we're not</v>

330
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>fully engaged with Catholicism was because they still associated with the Jewish</v>

331
00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:51.040
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

332
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I only by putting an end to this association with the problem be solved.</v>

333
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.461
<v Speaker 1>Consequently,</v>

334
00:15:56.461 --> 00:15:59.880
<v Speaker 1>he began putting pressure on the king and Queen's you issue an edict expanding</v>

335
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.230
<v Speaker 1>all Jews from Spain.</v>

336
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1495 Jews and six conveys A's were accused of crucifying and measuring a</v>

337
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Christian child in the village of the Goddamn the accusation.</v>

338
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.160
<v Speaker 1>It was probably false,</v>

339
00:16:11.161 --> 00:16:14.310
<v Speaker 1>but it led to an unprecedented antisemetic backlash.</v>

340
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.061
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

341
00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:19.020
<v Speaker 1>in March of 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand and sign their names to a documents</v>

342
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.440
<v Speaker 1>which ordered that all Jews who had not converted to Christianity,</v>

343
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.760
<v Speaker 1>where to leave the kingdom.</v>

344
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.880
<v Speaker 1>By August the second 1492 around 160,000 people manage to get out before the</v>

345
00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:30.720
<v Speaker 1>deadline.</v>

346
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Most of them sold their possessions for a pittance and were forced to travel as</v>

347
00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:34.920
<v Speaker 1>far as Africa,</v>

348
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the Balkans,</v>

349
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and Rome before finally finding a place to settle.</v>

350
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Many of them are unable to find a place where they would be accepted straggled</v>

351
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.940
<v Speaker 1>back to Spain to be baptized as Catholics.</v>

352
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Others reportedly paid exorbitant prices for passage on ships,</v>

353
00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Sony to be killed at sea and thrown overboard.</v>

354
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.000
<v Speaker 1>The number of Jews who remained in Spain is convert.</v>

355
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Those was far greater than those who had left and despite the worst efforts if</v>

356
00:16:58.111 --> 00:16:58.860
<v Speaker 1>the inquisition,</v>

357
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.170
<v Speaker 1>they remains Jewish believers at hot.</v>

358
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:01.801
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

359
00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:05.400
<v Speaker 1>these conversions now had no Jewish cultural support to back them up.</v>

360
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.090
<v Speaker 1>They were completely on their own synagogues throughout the lands where I've</v>

361
00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:12.780
<v Speaker 1>taken over and claimed for the Catholic Church by now talking about it,</v>

362
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:14.010
<v Speaker 1>it was at the height of his power.</v>

363
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.660
<v Speaker 1>He had unfettered control if the inquisition and was a key player in the royal</v>

364
00:17:18.661 --> 00:17:19.440
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>

365
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.310
<v Speaker 1>The combination of the inquisition,</v>

366
00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:21.631
<v Speaker 1>nams,</v>

367
00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:22.620
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish expulsion,</v>

368
00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:26.040
<v Speaker 1>had insured the Catholicism would remain untainted</v>

371

372
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Pope Gregory the fourth appointed for assistant inquisitors to lighten the load.</v>

373
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.060
<v Speaker 1>In that same year,</v>

374
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Isabella and Ferdinand gift attended the Jewish cemetery at a villa for him to</v>

376
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It was here that he died peacefully on September the 16th 1498 the acquisition</v>

382
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 1>The inquisition remains one of the worst examples of man's inhumanity towards</v>

383
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 1>man and the man who led it.</v>
