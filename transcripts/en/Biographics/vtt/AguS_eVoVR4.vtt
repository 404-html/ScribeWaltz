<v Speaker 1>as in all of history.</v>

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Yet his story reverberates as a tale of the dangers of power on bounds.</v>

5
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>It is military genius and political skill saw him rise to the position of</v>

6
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>dictator for life,</v>

7
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>but it all came to a bloody end.</v>

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>On the ides of March.</v>

13
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.580

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Jesus' birth.</v>

15

17
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>While his mother or really I belonged to a family of some prominence.</v>

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Seizes on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Political movements.</v>

22
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>We don't know very much about Caesar's childhood,</v>

23
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but his education included the study of the Greek language and he read the works</v>

24
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>of Greek historians in his early teens.</v>

25
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 1>He began attending lectures on philosophy and rhetoric,</v>

26
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>showing a keen interest in developing his skills as a public speaker.</v>

27
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.111
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

28
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>this was something of a price stability in Rome.</v>

29
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>The Roman forum was the center of intellectual discussion and debate in Rome</v>

30
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>during seasons youth.</v>

31
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>It was there that political ideas were argued out where questions were discussed</v>

32
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>in elections,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was showing himself to be a young man of quite some ambition.</v>

37
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.360

40
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the 16 year old Julius was now the head of the family.</v>

41
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>He inherited this leadership at the very time that civil war was breaking out</v>

42
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>between the popular faction,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The 18 year old Caesar was now forced into hiding.</v>

61
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>It was only the influence of his mother's family.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nicodemus in order to exact a promise for a fleet of ships.</v>

77
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>He was successful in its mission,</v>

78
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.460

00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:09.840
<v Speaker 1>powerful and passionate public speaker in 75 bce.</v>

89
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>While on his way to advance his studies in Greece,</v>

90
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Caesar was kidnapped by Sicilian pirates and held for ransom.</v>

91
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It is reputed that when the pirates told it and they had demanded 20 talents for</v>

92
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:20.580
<v Speaker 1>his release,</v>

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 1>he was insulted and insisted that they increase it to 50 talents.</v>

94
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>He was treated well by the pirates and has a relaxed time with them.</v>

95
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

96
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.180
<v Speaker 1>the the ransom was paid and he was released.</v>

97
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>He vowed to them that he would hunt them down and have them crucified.</v>

98
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Speaker 1>He was good to his word raising group of volunteers and overpowering his former</v>

99
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 1>capitalist prior to their execution,</v>

100
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.760
<v Speaker 1>yet the pirates throats carts as a show of leniency for having treated him well.</v>

101
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after his pirate escapade.</v>

102
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Caesar was recalled into military service he was sending to the province of Asia</v>

103
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and tasked with raising a volunteer force to put down a rebellion.</v>

104
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Upon successful completion of this mission,</v>

105
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>he returned to Rome and was duly appointed as a military tribune.</v>

106
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 1>It was the first step of his political career.</v>

107
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Season was not shy about espousing his support for the popular faction,</v>

108
00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>which had been put down by Sulla years before he took on the prominent case of a</v>

109
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.180
<v Speaker 1>reigning the governor of Macedonia dollar Bella,</v>

110
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.410
<v Speaker 1>who had been closely associated with Suda.</v>

111
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.383
<v Speaker 1>When the trial came,</v>

112
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Caesar appeared at the forum,</v>

113
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.250
<v Speaker 1>the force and vigor with which he rated his argument sweating great public</v>

114
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>support in opposing dollar.</v>

115
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Bella sees it was positioning himself as the people's champion.</v>

116
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>He was increasingly being seen as the natural inheritor of Marius in order to</v>

117
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 1>head up the popular faction with Suna supporters still in the ascendancy,</v>

118
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:42.651
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

119
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Dolabella was acquitted,</v>

120
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but the case had made Julia Caesar,</v>

121
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the most conspicuous men in all of Rome.</v>

122
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Caesar loved the prominence that he was receiving.</v>

123
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>He began to take on the character of the leader of the Popular Party.</v>

124
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>He spoke fluently in the forum both before assemblies and in the courts of</v>

125
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>

126
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>It is legal role.</v>

127
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>He came to specialize in defending those who were accused of political crimes</v>

128
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>through his energy and his boldness,</v>

129
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 1>not to mention the strength of logic and reasoning that he demonstrated.</v>

130
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>He became the rising champion of the people when Caesar's onto the wife of</v>

131
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Marius Julia dive.</v>

132
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>He arranged to hold a prominent funeral for her since the time of the</v>

133
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>suppression of our husbands and the potty.</v>

134
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:22.980
<v Speaker 1>He headed junior,</v>

135
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>had lived in obscurity,</v>

136
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.771
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

137
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>any who associated with were putting their lives in danger.</v>

138
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Yet the fearless Caesar said there's a flattering funeral oration from the</v>

139
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>rostrum of the forum.</v>

140
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>He went as far as condemning the ouster of his uncle and producing images of</v>

176
00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:01.170
<v Speaker 1>caught up in a damaging political scandal.</v>

177
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.700
<v Speaker 1>In 67 bce,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Caesar was appointed as a formal magistrates.</v>

179
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.503
<v Speaker 1>Around this time,</v>

180
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:11.520
<v Speaker 1>it began to engage in the popular custom of cementing public favor by staging a</v>

181
00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:13.290
<v Speaker 1>lavish entertainment spectacles.</v>

182
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 1>These included games with wildebeests and gladiators being brought in from all</v>

00:08:23.581 --> 00:08:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but they also put a huge strain on his finances.</v>

187
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.480
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

188
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.920
<v Speaker 1>they punched him into debt.</v>

189
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Speaker 1>The only way that you could possibly extricate himself from his financial woes</v>

190
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.570
<v Speaker 1>was by rising to a position of ultimate power.</v>

191
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.070
<v Speaker 1>In 63 bce,</v>

192
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Caesar set his sights on the position of Pontifex maximus or chief priest.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He spends even more borrowed money on popular support and despite being opposed</v>

194
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:48.300
<v Speaker 1>by two powerful senators,</v>

195
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>he won the position handily the following year.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you could take up the position.</v>

198
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

199
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.830
<v Speaker 1>he was required to settle his outstanding debts for this,</v>

200
00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 1>he turns to one of the city's richest men,</v>

201
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>marcus,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the skinniest crassus grasses agreed to help sees a financially on the basis</v>

203

204
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 1>provide political influence in [inaudible] favor,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sees now travel to Spain,</v>

206
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but he proved to be a successful administrator you have to give to both military</v>

207
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>and financial success.</v>

208
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>We're tending to rhyme with enough money to pay off all of his debts,</v>

209
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>sees a.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They had vested sea pre magistracy in the hands of two consoles.</v>

214
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>These men were chosen each year in the general election.</v>

215
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It was left to the people sees,</v>

216

<v Speaker 1>among them.</v>

218
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.910
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

219
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.380
<v Speaker 1>there were a number of influential political rivals who opposed him at the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was a buser rivalry unfolding between two men have great influence upon</v>

225
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He succeeded brilliantly in his plan managing to create a triumvirate of the</v>

226
00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:16.720
<v Speaker 1>three most influential politicians in Rome,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Caesar set about securing his appointment to the console.</v>

233
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.761
<v Speaker 1>It's political.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Opponents knew that they would be unable to prevent public support from securing</v>

235
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:38.470
<v Speaker 1>the console ship for Caesar,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They put forward bitterness.</v>

239
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He was a political opponent to Caesar for the position,</v>

240
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.710

<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

243
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Caesar immediately proceeded to ignore his colleague assuming full power in</v>

244
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.170
<v Speaker 1>carrying out measures unilaterally that were geared to ingratiate himself with</v>

250
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.260
<v Speaker 1>When Caesar asked where he was going,</v>

251
00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:27.070
<v Speaker 1>he replied to that he would rather be in prison with Keto than in the Senate.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pompey was appointed to the consult without colleague.</v>

339
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.600
<v Speaker 1>He quickly aligns himself with the ultimate faction of Arris to crat suit where</v>

340
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>post to Caesar the following year with Caesar's military conquest having been</v>

<v Speaker 1>They had developed popular factions in supportive both pompey and Caesar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The lasses follow his attempted to have him voted to the console in absentia,</v>

347
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>but the opposition demanded that he first returned to face the music and give up</v>

348
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the commands of his army sees the bulks at least amounts.</v>

349
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.870

350
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.890
<v Speaker 1>He had to march on Rome and claim what he rightfully saw as his.</v>

<v Speaker 1>his province.</v>

354
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 1>This was an immediate active civil war.</v>

355
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

356
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.230
<v Speaker 1>there will be my battle Pompei with most of his forces deployed in Spain,</v>

357
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 1>fled to the south.</v>

358
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 1>This enabled Caesar's march on Rome on hindered that he had himself declared</v>

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.411
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>

362
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:24.561
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 1>so touts in pursuit of Pompei,</v>

364
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.160

<v Speaker 1>Caesar in 48 bce,</v>

371
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.821
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

372
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Caesar one by employing superior tactics,</v>

373
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Pohnpei,</v>

374
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.550

382
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.030
<v Speaker 1>The Raymond Nita saw Cleopatra as a useful future ally integrated to support</v>

383
00:17:18.031 --> 00:17:21.390
<v Speaker 1>that a prolonged Egyptian siege of Alexandria followed.</v>

388
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:34.440
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians were defeated.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra was installed as Pharaoh and after spending a further two months</v>

<v Speaker 1>things had not gone well in Rome,</v>

397
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:49.090
<v Speaker 1>largely due to Marc Antony,</v>

398
00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.053
<v Speaker 1>ms dot managements,</v>

399

<v Speaker 1>He ruled autocratically.</v>

405
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>This goal is great business among the senators who we ignored.</v>

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Primary among the dissenters were the two sons of Pompeii,</v>

415
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>stating that Jupiter was the only for king if the Romans,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was on the 15th of March,</v>

420
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>44 bce,</v>

421
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.250
<v Speaker 1>unknown disease at 60 of his most bitter rivals in the centers has come to the</v>

422
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 1>meeting with daggers concealed under that togas Caesar entered the chamber and</v>

423
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:00.360
<v Speaker 1>proceeded to make his way to his golden chat.</v>

424
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Other designated signal senators,</v>

425
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

426
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.090
<v Speaker 1>directions leapt upon him as the first dagger blow came down upon him,</v>

427
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Caesar was hard to cry out.</v>

428
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Why this violence to avid supporters tried to come to his aid,</v>

429
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but they were blocked by the conspirators within limits,</v>

430
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>had been stabbed 23 times.</v>

431
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 1>His final act was to cover his face with his toga so that none would see his</v>

432
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:22.104
<v Speaker 1>death expression.</v>

433
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Cesar died at the feet of a statue of pompey.</v>

434
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>The conspirators wanted to throw his body into the Tiber river,</v>

435
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 1>that they were stopped by Marc Antony.</v>

436
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.070
<v Speaker 1>The announcement that Caesar was dead.</v>

437
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.700
<v Speaker 1>It was met with rioting by the people and to the conspirators were forced to</v>

438
00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:35.851
<v Speaker 1>flee.</v>

439
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:39.510
<v Speaker 1>The city sees his body was cremated with the Temple of Caesar being built on the</v>

440
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>cremation site.</v>

441
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.370
<v Speaker 1>From that point on,</v>

442
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:45.870
<v Speaker 1>the legend of the martyred Caesar would be passed down through the centuries.</v>
