<v Speaker 1>Shut down on a rooftop in the city that he ruled over.</v>

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.600

27
00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>community that was fueled by the cocaine and marijuana trade.</v>

28
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Although not everyone's directly participated in the drug business.</v>

29
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 1>They all had a powerful incentive in the protection of those that did the</v>

30
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:27.551
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

31
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 1>That was part and parcel of enforcing the narcotic straight with all around</v>

<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>the family moved to end avocado,</v>

35
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.660
<v Speaker 1>a small village just outside of [inaudible] so that her Milda could establish an</v>

<v Speaker 1>elementary school that Abel sold the farm and took up a job as a neighborhood to</v>

<v Speaker 1>it soon became a popular and well respected member of the community at school.</v>

40
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Pablo proved himself to be enabled and quick witted students,</v>

41
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>although tending toward the Chubby side,</v>

42
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>thanks to his love of fast food,</v>

43
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>he was talented in all ball sports with a special love for soccer.</v>

44
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Many of us teachers were involved in social causes,</v>

45
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>especially the struggle for classic quality and they became very powerful</v>

46
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>influences on the young Pablo.</v>

47
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was in his early teens public was attending street rallies and</v>

48
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 1>participating in such activities like throwing rocks at the police probably</v>

49
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>became part of a youth culture movement known as an a day Smoot,</v>

50
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>which encouraged young people to thumb their noses at the established order they</v>

51
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:28.360
<v Speaker 1>were to do things like disobey their parents and write their own rules.</v>

52
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Part of this counter cultural movements involved experimentation with drugs</v>

53
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>leading the 13 year old future drug kingpin to develop an addiction to</v>

54
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

55
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 1>which would never leave him.</v>

56
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 16 Pablo had developed into a plumper shorter youth standing just</v>

58
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>over five foot six inches.</v>

59
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 1>He had a round face and what a slight mustache.</v>

60
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>A couple of before reaching his 17th birthday,</v>

61
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>he dropped out of school board with the straight laced routine and keen to make</v>

62
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>his own way in the wells.</v>

63
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>After quitting school,</v>

64
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>the enterprising pab lobe started up a bicycle repair shop.</v>

65
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.040
<v Speaker 1>He would prowl the streets,</v>

66
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>sends the local dump in search of discarded bicycle parts and then use them to</v>

67
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>fix bikes are cheap with the money that he made from this enterprise.</v>

68
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>He purchased himself a Lambretta motorcycle.</v>

69
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Now with a means of foster escape,</v>

70
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>he began planning how to make more money more easily than the by repairing</v>

71
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>bicycles for a pittance.</v>

72
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>According to legends,</v>

73
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Foray into crime began with him stealing headstones from the local</v>

74
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>cemetery sounds,</v>

75
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>blasting the names from them and then reselling them.</v>

76
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Pablo then decided though that the root to quick cash lay in commercial business</v>

77
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>rubbery.</v>

78
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>He started by scoping out potential targets.</v>

79
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>He would then ride to the target business on his motorbike,</v>

80
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>set Abella cover over his head and rush to the business with a knife or a gun in</v>

81
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

82
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>demanding money,</v>

83
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>and then be got out of that.</v>

84
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>All of this would happen in about 30 seconds.</v>

85
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>after a few successful robberies populate,</v>

87
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>recruited his cousin to join him.</v>

88
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>One would ride the bike and act as the getaway writer while the other stormed</v>

89
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>into the business.</v>

90
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>But within a few months,</v>

91
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.471
<v Speaker 1>patty,</v>

92
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>they became bored of this and moved onto bigger and it's easier things.</v>

93
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>He established a contact with a rent,</v>

94
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>a car dealership.</v>

95
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>He would provide him with copies of the keys to cars that he had just sold along</v>

96
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>with the addresses of the buyers.</v>

97
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>All the Pablo had to do was turn up at the address and drive the cars away.</v>

98
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>In his late teens,</v>

99
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 1>they public got caught in the act of stealing one of these cars.</v>

100
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>He ended up spending several months in Lala Dara jail,</v>

101
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>which was to him a very positive life experience.</v>

102
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>It was in this jail cause he learns how to move into bigger criminal activity,</v>

103
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>including kidnapping,</v>

104
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.673
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking.</v>

105
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.030
<v Speaker 1>One SPEC on the street,</v>

106
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Pablo and his cousin,</v>

107
00:04:57.081 --> 00:04:57.621
<v Speaker 1>Gustavo,</v>

108
00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:59.540
<v Speaker 1>went right back to stealing costs.</v>

109
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>They built up a collection of stolen engine parts,</v>

110
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:03.530
<v Speaker 1>which they would sell off bit by bit.</v>

111
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.670
<v Speaker 1>The bear then took to building race cars with Pablo competing in local events.</v>

112
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Ans Garcia weren't the only ones stealing cars in metagene though,</v>

113
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 1>which led to an extension of his operation.</v>

114
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>He decided to also sell protection so the people would pay him to ensure that</v>

115
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 1>their car did not get taken.</v>

116
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Ballet was able to provide such a service because he had developed a reputation</v>

117
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.220
<v Speaker 1>as an unpredictable and violence young man.</v>

118
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.920
<v Speaker 1>If anyone who didn't money probably would hire a local thug,</v>

119
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.300
<v Speaker 1>do you kidnap that person?</v>

120
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>He would then ransom him for whatever was owed to him from time to time.</v>

121
00:05:35.961 --> 00:05:40.100
<v Speaker 1>He would even have that person kills when the ransom was paid simply to engender</v>

122
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 1>fear in those he dealt with before long paddlow decided to specialize in</v>

123
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:45.770
<v Speaker 1>kidnappings for their own sake,</v>

124
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.110
<v Speaker 1>along with his cousin and future brother in law.</v>

125
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 1>He nabbed a rich businessman by the name of Diego Acca Varia.</v>

126
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.610
<v Speaker 1>This man was intensely disliked by many of the poor workers in Midian.</v>

127
00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>He were being laid off droves by industrialists like him despite the family.</v>

128
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:00.661
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

129
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>In the $50,000 ransom demands.</v>

130
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Echo varia was beaten,</v>

131
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>strangles and then dumped in a ditch even though he had just committed a</v>

132
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:08.841
<v Speaker 1>terrible crime.</v>

133
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>His choice of victim made Pablo hugely popular.</v>

134
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Among the common folk have met a yin in a strange way.</v>

135
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>They saw the killings as public striking a blow for social equality.</v>

136
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

137
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.990
<v Speaker 1>In 1971 the 22 year old Pavlo began working for [inaudible] based Contraband</v>

138
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Dealer Alvara Prieto underappreciated.</v>

139
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Pablo was doing a modest amount of drug trafficking before long.</v>

140
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

141
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>he decided that he wanted more of a slice of the pie for himself.</v>

142
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>He drove his stolen running four to Ecuador and bought five kilograms of</v>

143
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Peruvian cocaine paste successfully passing through a number of police and</v>

144
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>military checkpoints.</v>

145
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>He returned to Midian where he processed the cocaine.</v>

146
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>He next contacted fellow criminals.</v>

147
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The Ochoa brothers just set up a sale to a local cocaine chief called fattier</v>

148
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.334
<v Speaker 1>Restrepo.</v>

149
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>The sale netted Pavlo close to $100,000 far surpassing anything he had</v>

150
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:14.180
<v Speaker 1>previously done and setting himself up firmly on the path to becoming a high end</v>

151
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>drug dealer within two months.</v>

152
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>February Restrepo had been murdered.</v>

153
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there was a new man of the head of the [inaudible] cocaine operation,</v>

154
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>and that was Pablo Escobar.</v>

155
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Now importantly,</v>

156
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>it has never been conclusively proven.</v>

157
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>The Pablo murdered Restrepo,</v>

158
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>but that was what everyone involved believed.</v>

159
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>The majority of people working for Restrepo were upper class dandies.</v>

160
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 1>They were pretty frightened by Pablo and the ruthless hoodlums that he</v>

161
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>surrounded himself with.</v>

162
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after muscling his way to the top of the median,</v>

163
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 1>cocaine's indicas.</v>

164
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Pablo married 15 year old Maria,</v>

165
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Victoria,</v>

166
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Helena Vallejo,</v>

167
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.593
<v Speaker 1>so now Pablo,</v>

168
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 1>he was 26 years old.</v>

169
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.903
<v Speaker 1>He had a wife,</v>

170
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>he had wealth and he had power.</v>

171
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>It really seems like the sky was going to be the limit.</v>

172
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>The cocaine trade from Panama through Columbia and into the United States boomed</v>

173
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>in the late 1970s with most of it being trafficked through Escobar's</v>

174
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 1>organization under pablet with the cocaine industry became streamlined.</v>

175
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>He purchased a fleet of airplanes including a Leer jet transport the drugs into</v>

176
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>the United States where there was an inexhaustible supply of willing buyers.</v>

177
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Two months after his wedding though Pablo and four others were arrested,</v>

178
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>resounding from a drug run to Ecuador,</v>

179
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>drug enforcement agents founds 39 kilos of cocaine isn't in the spare tire of</v>

180
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>their truck.</v>

181
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Vast amounts of coke would see Pablo put away for a long,</v>

182
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

183
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>His first tactic and getting out of the mess was to bribe the trial judge.</v>

184
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 1>The offer,</v>

185
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.371
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

186
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>was flatly rejected.</v>

187
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.450
<v Speaker 1>How beloved then had his team recently,</v>

188
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>the judges backgrounds,</v>

189
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>they discovered that he had a brother who was a lawyer and that the two men did</v>

190
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>not get on.</v>

191
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>The lawyer was contacted and offered a huge amounts to represent Pablo in the</v>

192
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

193
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.531
<v Speaker 1>As suspected,</v>

194
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.420
<v Speaker 1>the judge was forced to recuse himself due to the conflict of interest and the</v>

195
00:08:55.421 --> 00:08:55.891
<v Speaker 1>new judge.</v>

196
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>he had less scruples about taking the payments.</v>

198
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 1>He accepted the bribe and Pablo and his cohorts walked free.</v>

199
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Exorbitant amounts of money.</v>

200
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>We're now pouring into Colombia with deposits in the countries.</v>

201
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:12.351
<v Speaker 1>Four major banks doubling between 1976 and 1980 [inaudible] was then able to use</v>

202
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>his millions to take possession of every step of his operation.</v>

203
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Traveling to Peru,</v>

204
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>

205
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's Panama,</v>

206
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and buying up all the cultivation farms and processing plants.</v>

207
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 1>He was also able to buy off enforcement agencies in every country developing a</v>

208
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>ruthless policy which came to be known as silver or led.</v>

209
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>If officials didn't accept his bribe,</v>

210
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>they could expect to end up debt.</v>

211
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>By 1980 Pablo was at the absolute height of his power with every law enforcement</v>

212
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>agency on his payroll.</v>

213
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>He was the unofficial king of Midian.</v>

214
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the only cocaine,</v>

215
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Impresario and Columbia,</v>

216
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly was the most successful.</v>

217
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 1>He owns multiple mansions.</v>

218
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He had racing cars,</v>

219
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>helicopters and planes,</v>

220
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.330
<v Speaker 1>and was constantly surrounded by bodyguards and hangers on cocaine.</v>

221
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Money absolutely transformed many in with discos and high and restaurants</v>

222
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>opening up all over the city.</v>

223
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>One of paddleloons passions was soccer and now he was able to indulge it.</v>

224
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>He paid to have fields levels and sorted and lights installed so that he and his</v>

225
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>crew could play at nighttime.</v>

226
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>He also employed professional game callers to announce the matches as if they</v>

227
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>were an FAA Cup final in 1979 papillary wheels,</v>

228
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 1>a lavish country estate.</v>

229
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 1>On a 7,400 acre ranch,</v>

230
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>80 miles outside of Midean and dws,</v>

231
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Hacienda Las and Apollos.</v>

232
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>He brought exotic animals from all over the worlds to populate the farm,</v>

233
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>built six swimming pools and a huge mansion that could sleep 100 guests at the</v>

234
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:41.360
<v Speaker 1>same time that he was indulging his every materialistic women private Pablo</v>

235
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>began tending to his public image.</v>

236
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 1>He constantly denied that he was involved in any illicit activity,</v>

237
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>portraying a formal,</v>

238
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 1>likable persona and appearing humble and polite.</v>

239
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.470
<v Speaker 1>He consciously cultivated the image that he was a freedom fighter for the</v>

240
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:56.304
<v Speaker 1>underprivileged,</v>

241
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>setting himself up as an alternative to the establishment.</v>

242
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>He also poured millions of dollars into social construction programs.</v>

243
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Between 1980 and 1982 Pablo did more to help the poor and meti in than the</v>

244
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Colombian government had ever done.</v>

245
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 1>One of his most popular initiatives was a housing projects.</v>

246
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>There was called Barrio Pablo Escobar,</v>

247
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.410
<v Speaker 1>where houses were bills,</v>

248
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and it's given us a families who had previously been sheltering in shacks.</v>

249
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 1>The city dump this and a host of other projects easily made him the most popular</v>

250
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>citizen in [inaudible] in private.</v>

251
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Pablo conducted himself in an understated manner.</v>

252
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.140
<v Speaker 1>He spoke softly and was generally relaxed and casual with the people around him.</v>

253
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>He was also hugely self-indulgence with food,</v>

254
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>with drink and with women,</v>

255
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>and he considered himself a law unto himself.</v>

256
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>As an example of this,</v>

257
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 1>on one occasion when an employee was found to have stolen from him,</v>

258
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Pablo had him brought before him bound hand and first and then kicked it into</v>

259
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:50.570
<v Speaker 1>the swimming pool.</v>

260
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>They can everyone watch as the man drowns</v>

261
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 1>with his popularity among the masses firmly established and his dominance over</v>

262
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>his empire assured.</v>

263
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The next logical step for Pablo was politics.</v>

264
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>His path to and legitimate office began in 1978 when he was elected as a</v>

265
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 1>substitute city counselor in met a year in 1980 he gave his personal and</v>

266
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>financial support to the formation of a new national political movements,</v>

267
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 1>the new Liberal Party.</v>

268
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1982 he ran for and was elected to Congress all the as a substitute who</v>

269
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 1>attended when the primary delegate from that a yin was unavailable,</v>

270
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 1>a major perk of being elected to Congress was that now Pablo had judicial</v>

271
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:40.683
<v Speaker 1>immunity,</v>

272
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>meaning that he could not be convicted for any crime under Colombian law.</v>

273
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 1>The position also afforded him a diplomatic visa,</v>

274
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>which he made you solve to regularly take his family on trips to the United</v>

275
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

276
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 1>On one of these trips,</v>

277
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>he purchased an $8 million mansion in Miami Beach,</v>

278
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

279
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So public now had political legitimacy to go with his massive wealth.</v>

280
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And the next acquisition you made was a personal army,</v>

281
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>one of friends of the family.</v>

282
00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>He was kidnapped by m 19 gorillas.</v>

283
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>He created a private militia to hunt down these rebels.</v>

284
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Blues Army was known as death to kidnappers.</v>

285
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So Pablo is wider exposure as a result of his political office.</v>

286
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.930
<v Speaker 1>When it was the beginning of his downfall in Midian,</v>

287
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Pablo,</v>

288
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.880
<v Speaker 1>he was viewed as this Robin Hood figure,</v>

289
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 1>but when he'd tried to gain the favor of polite Colombian society,</v>

290
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.010
<v Speaker 1>he was not welcomed.</v>

291
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>They viewed him as what he really was a ruthless cocaine king with absolutely no</v>

292
00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 1>scruples when he turns up to take a seat in Congress as an alternate for the</v>

293
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:39.850
<v Speaker 1>first time on August the 16th 1983 with a bevy of bodyguards in tow,</v>

294
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 1>he was first denied entry for not wearing a tie.</v>

295
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>He quickly got hold of one and swept since the Pax Chamber.</v>

296
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.600
<v Speaker 1>He slumps down in his allocated seats and began nervously to bite his</v>

297
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:50.434
<v Speaker 1>fingernails.</v>

298
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Immediately the chamber president stood up and demanded that all body guards be</v>

299
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.480
<v Speaker 1>removed from the chamber.</v>

300
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Pablo nodded and just thugs left the room within minutes.</v>

301
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara was on his feet defending a claim of corruption</v>

302
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that had been brought against him.</v>

303
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Laura pointed his finger at Pablo and stated we have a congressman who was born</v>

304
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.290
<v Speaker 1>in a very poor area himself,</v>

305
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:11.711
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

306
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>very poor and afterwards through a stage of business,</v>

307
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>deals in bicycles and other things.</v>

308
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Appears with a gigantic fortune with nine Blaine's three hangers at the media</v>

309
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>unit airport and creates the movement death to kidnappers while on the other</v>

310
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

311
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 1>mountains charitable organizations with which she tries to bribe a needy and</v>

312
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>unprotected people.</v>

313
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Now there are investigations going in the United States of which I cannot inform</v>

314
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you here tonight in the House on the criminal conduct of Pablo Escobar.</v>

315
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:39.581
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

316
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Pablo said nothing in the house,</v>

317
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:45.460
<v Speaker 1>but when he left he was besieged by reporters breaking free.</v>

318
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>He stormed off through his lawyer.</v>

319
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 1>He informs Laura that if he did not present evidence of his claims within 24</v>

320
00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

321
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 1>he would face legal action.</v>

322
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Laura willingly obliged and then the coming days,</v>

323
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 1>the newspapers were filled with all sorts of revelations about Pablos criminal</v>

324
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.733
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

325
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Pablo was now persona non grata in political circles.</v>

326
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.540
<v Speaker 1>He was kicked out of the new Liberal Party and theU s embassy revoked has</v>

327
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:19.560
<v Speaker 1>diplomatic visa.</v>

328
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.340
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic church also renounced their supportive and the governments even</v>

329
00:15:23.341 --> 00:15:26.520
<v Speaker 1>seized 85 of the exotic animals on Pabla his ranch,</v>

330
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.830
<v Speaker 1>claiming that they had entered the country illegally.</v>

331
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Pablo,</v>

332
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.740
<v Speaker 1>his political career is now in ruins.</v>

333
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Even worse for Pablo be Colombian governments at Laura's urgings was fast</v>

334
00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:39.390
<v Speaker 1>tracking an extradition treaty with the u s that would see him trying in America</v>

335
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.100
<v Speaker 1>for selling cocaine in that country.</v>

336
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>In May of 1984 justice minister Lara was shot seven times while riding in his</v>

337
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.490
<v Speaker 1>chauffer driven limousine,</v>

338
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.830
<v Speaker 1>but Pablo had powerful enemies.</v>

339
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.970
<v Speaker 1>US President Ronald Reagan had announced a major crackdown on the cocaine trade</v>

340
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.170
<v Speaker 1>with the death of Laura.</v>

341
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.010
<v Speaker 1>The Colombian government were willing to cooperate with American authorities to</v>

342
00:15:59.011 --> 00:16:01.530
<v Speaker 1>go after narco kingpins and Pablo.</v>

343
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.120
<v Speaker 1>He was the biggest of them all.</v>

344
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:07.710
<v Speaker 1>The killing of Lara also turns much of the Colombian population against Pavlay</v>

345
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.640
<v Speaker 1>by this act.</v>

346
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>He had declared war on the state for Pablo.</v>

347
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.060
<v Speaker 1>The heat was too much to bear and he skip the country taking a helicopter to</v>

348
00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Panama City.</v>

349
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

350
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.150
<v Speaker 1>despite being offered asylum in Panama,</v>

351
00:16:18.151 --> 00:16:19.140
<v Speaker 1>just the year before,</v>

352
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Pablo and his cronies were not welcomed by the authority.</v>

353
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.300
<v Speaker 1>After just a few weeks in exile Pablo,</v>

354
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.040
<v Speaker 1>he was desperate to get back home.</v>

355
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.030
<v Speaker 1>He made overtures to the Colombian government's drafting a proposal whereby he</v>

356
00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:33.810
<v Speaker 1>would go straight and he uses massive influence to read Columbia of drug</v>

357
00:16:33.811 --> 00:16:34.470
<v Speaker 1>trafficking,</v>

358
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.040
<v Speaker 1>provided that he could retain his possessions in Midian and that he would be</v>

359
00:16:38.041 --> 00:16:41.760
<v Speaker 1>exempt from arrest or extradition to the United States.</v>

360
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.080
<v Speaker 1>There's other though it was roundly rejected when the Panamanian army rated one</v>

361
00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:48.480
<v Speaker 1>of the labs that he had situated on the Colombian border.</v>

362
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.610
<v Speaker 1>He fled Panama for Nicaragua.</v>

363
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.271
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

364
00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:55.050
<v Speaker 1>he was hearing that his absence from Columbia was undermining his control of the</v>

365
00:16:55.051 --> 00:16:55.980
<v Speaker 1>median cartel,</v>

366
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.930
<v Speaker 1>the kidnapping of a 73 year old father.</v>

367
00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:58.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

368
00:16:58.531 --> 00:16:59.580
<v Speaker 1>that was a step too far.</v>

369
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Pablo audit,</v>

370
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.260
<v Speaker 1>a killing frenzy throughout in dozens of suspected kidnappers.</v>

371
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.460
<v Speaker 1>They would just gunned down.</v>

372
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:05.971
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

373
00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:07.290
<v Speaker 1>they gave in and Pablo,</v>

374
00:17:07.291 --> 00:17:10.710
<v Speaker 1>his old man was released with no ransom ever being paid.</v>

375
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.863
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

376
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.650
<v Speaker 1>In the midst of the carnage over his father's kidnapping,</v>

377
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Pablo returned to Columbia.</v>

378
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.170
<v Speaker 1>He was now determined to take on the state with everything that he had around</v>

379
00:17:29.171 --> 00:17:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Medina.</v>

380
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.560
<v Speaker 1>He was untouchable having bought off every official.</v>

381
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.460
<v Speaker 1>This allows him,</v>

382
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.700
<v Speaker 1>although being the most wanted man in the country to move around the town</v>

383
00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:37.330
<v Speaker 1>freely.</v>

384
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Public vengeful focus during the mid eighties was squarely centered on the</v>

385
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:41.950
<v Speaker 1>judiciary,</v>

386
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.640
<v Speaker 1>especially judges who supported the extradition treaty with the U s.</v>

387
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:46.870
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

388
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.060
<v Speaker 1>more than 30 judges were shot dead.</v>

389
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Then in November of 1985 the gorilla grip,</v>

390
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm 19 having been paid $1 million by Pavlo,</v>

391
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 1>stormed the palace of justice and how's the entire supreme court hostage.</v>

392
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 1>They demanded that the government renounced the extradition treaty in the</v>

393
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:04.230
<v Speaker 1>resulting siege.</v>

394
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 1>11 of the 24 justices along with 40 of the rebels were killed.</v>

395
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 1>By the beginning of 1988 killings were being reported on an almost daily basis.</v>

396
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Martial law was declared to around the state from toppling.</v>

397
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 1>On August the 18th 1989 pueblos kill squads gun down both the front running</v>

398
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>presidential candidates,</v>

399
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:23.814
<v Speaker 1>Luis Galen,</v>

400
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and say state police chief.</v>

401
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 1>In the following four months,</v>

402
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the Colombian government apprehended and sent more than 20 suspected drug</v>

403
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>traffickers to the United States to stand trial and national police units with</v>

404
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 1>stations to Metta Une specifically to hunt down Pablo.</v>

405
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Within the first month,</v>

406
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>30 of the 200 men station there had been killed.</v>

407
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Pablo was evading as governments and inflicting enormous casualties,</v>

408
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 1>but he was a man constantly on the run.</v>

409
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 1>He always stayed a step ahead of his pursuers,</v>

410
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but he was growing tired of the constant relocations that were needed.</v>

411
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Eventually he was driven to negotiate.</v>

412
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Pablo agreed to put an end to all the violence to stop all criminal activity and</v>

413
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 1>hand himself in.</v>

414
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.003
<v Speaker 1>In exchange,</v>

415
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Speaker 1>he demands it preferential treatments in a prison of his choosing and a reduced</v>

416
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.773
<v Speaker 1>settlement.</v>

417
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 1>The government had already revoked the extradition treaty to the U s with its</v>

418
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:15.120
<v Speaker 1>1991 constitution,</v>

419
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 1>so he didn't have to worry about being sent to America and it's with all of</v>

420
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

421
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Pablo was duly arrested and duty tried.</v>

422
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.940
<v Speaker 1>He began his sentence as low catty drought prison in June of 1991 but this,</v>

423
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

424
00:19:27.371 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 1>it was like no other prison on earth.</v>

425
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 1>If featured a football pitch to QC and a bar,</v>

426
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.410
<v Speaker 1>all of the prison guards were pub Lowe's employees.</v>

427
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 1>The prison cells were more like hotel suites and the food that Pablo and his</v>

428
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:38.420
<v Speaker 1>fellow inmates.</v>

429
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It was prepared by chefs who were brought in from the finest restaurants.</v>

430
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But after a few months,</v>

431
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 1>accounts began to reach official channels that Pablo was continuing to pursue</v>

432
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:48.690
<v Speaker 1>his criminal activities from the prison.</v>

433
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 1>This was a violation of the surrender agreements and to move as were put in</v>

434
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 1>place to sees him and move him to a regular prison.</v>

435
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Pablos connections enabled him to get a wind of the plan and he escaped before</v>

436
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:00.534
<v Speaker 1>authorities.</v>

437
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.453
<v Speaker 1>It get to him,</v>

438
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.343
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

439
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Pablo is back on,</v>

440
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 1>but now the u s and Colombian authorities were joins buying a vigilante group</v>

441
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 1>known as the Los Padres,</v>

442
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 1>which stood for people persecuted by Pablo Escobar.</v>

443
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Last pap has carried out a ruthless campaign,</v>

444
00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:28.420
<v Speaker 1>killing as many as 300 people who were connected to Pablo and disorganization.</v>

445
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Following his escape.</v>

446
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Public was constantly on the run.</v>

447
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Most of his closest associates were dad and his organization was totally falling</v>

448
00:20:35.431 --> 00:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

449
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.070
<v Speaker 1>He was spending nights sleeping in the jungle,</v>

450
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 1>afraid to speak on the radio or even to answer the phone.</v>

451
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:41.431
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

452
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>they fake caught up with Pablo Escobar.</v>

453
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 1>On December the second 1993 members of a Colombian search bloc team attracted</v>

454
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.330
<v Speaker 1>down to her house in Los Olivos in marine via radio intercepts.</v>

455
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>The search bloc team smashed through the heavy steel door with a sledgehammer,</v>

456
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>whereupon six of them rushed into the house.</v>

457
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It was then the shooting started with Pablo in the house was his most loyal</v>

458
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 1>bodyguard known as Lehman.</v>

459
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>They both bolted from the front room and made their way up into the roof.</v>

460
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.280
<v Speaker 1>The six search bloc members along with others outside port,</v>

461
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 1>a massive barrage of gunfire at their targets.</v>

462
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Lemon was hit several times in the back and tumbled to the ground below.</v>

463
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Then Pablo went down.</v>

464
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>He was struck several times in the leg and torso,</v>

465
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 1>but the fatal shot penetrated his skull on confirming his targets.</v>

466
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>The leader of the operation spoke excitedly into his radio viva like Columbia.</v>

467
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 1>We have just killed Pablo Escobar,</v>

468
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 1>but had they,</v>

469
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Pablo had always told his family that if cornered,</v>

470
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 1>he would commit suicide by placing a bullet in his skull.</v>

471
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Many people believe that he did so one smaller escaping the clutches of the</v>

472
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:42.820
