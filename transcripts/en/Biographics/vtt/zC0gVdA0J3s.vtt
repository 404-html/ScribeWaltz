1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.600
He was one of the most influential,

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.800
talented entertainers the world has ever seen.

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.840
But he was also one of the most complex,

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.440
generous and de friends champion of the underdog,
a devoted family man.

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.750
But he was also a womanizer.
He was a volatile,

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.880
it was loud mouth and he was a tough guy.

7
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.630
He lives in life on the edge of excitement,
danger,
and passionate.

8
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.560
So how did the skinny Italian kid from New Jersey become an international

9
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:25.760
superstar and the world's first true multimedia artist?
Well,

10
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:27.120
in this episode of biographics,

11
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.400
we go behind the veneer to get up close and personal with the chairman of the

12
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.234
board,

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.730
Francis Albert Sinatra.
I was born on December the 12th 1915 Hoboken,
New Jersey.

14
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.110
He was the only child of Italian immigrants,
Martin and Dolly Sinatra.
As such,

15
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:52.490
he was pampered by his parents.

16
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:55.250
He lavish the best of what they could afford on their son.

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.010
Still Little Frankie grew up lonely and alone.

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.790
Martin Sinatra was a down to earth,
easy going and hardworking city fireman.

19
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.920
His mother was just the opposite,
driven,

20
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.000
involved in political issues and proving herself the driving force of the
family.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.590
She belongs to every organization in Hoboken and had a reputation as an

22
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.420
extremely dominating character.

23
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.960
While both of his parents worked young frank to look after himself,

24
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.250
if he wasn't home alone,

25
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.250
he'd be out wandering the neighborhood where he quickly discovered how to become

26
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:24.830
street smart.
He grew up in the welds of prohibition,

27
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.030
bootleggers and speakeasies school was never a priority for the teenage frank.

28
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.630
He would often skip class to hang out in pool halls,
boxing gyms,

29
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:36.440
and on street corners.
He seemed developed a reputation as a stubborn,

30
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:40.580
ornery kids who would never back to down often the subjects of racial taunts.

31
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.450
He would never,

32
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.320
that's an insult pass a friend recalled is that once he and frank were walking

33
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.410
down the street,
when someone said,
hey,
you little wop to frank,

34
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.830
his friend told him to keep on walking,
but an enraged frank blurted out,

35
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.780
I'm going to walk all over his face.

36
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.080
The only problem was that frank didn't really know how to fight and he

37
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:59.980
subsequently got beaten to a pulp when his friend Austin,

38
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.860
whether it was worth it,
he replied,
hell yeah.
He'll never call me a walk again.

39
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.520
However,
two days later,
the same thing happened.
Same Guy,
same results.

40
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.670
By the age of 16 frank had ditched school altogether.

41
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.450
He works at a series of odd jobs,
including as a dock worker and a newspaper boy,

42
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.230
but he often got boards and we quit a solid job after just a few weeks when he

43
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.710
walked out on a job working in the refrigeration units of cargo ships.

44
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.030
His father had had enough.
He referred to his son as a quitter and told him,

45
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.370
if you want to be a bum,
go somewhere else and be a button.

46
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.370
Frank didn't have to be told twice.

47
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.090
He packed up his few belongings in a suitcase and took the train to New York

48
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.690
City.
By now,
he had set his sights on making it as a singer,

49
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.250
but no doors opens for the skinny Italian get.

50
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.250
He couldn't find any employment at all,

51
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.660
let alone a singing gig with nowhere to stay and no money for food he had at

52
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.720
home.
I would leave.
Dolly mocked her son singing ambitions,

53
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:54.050
referring to him as mister bigshot before smacking him on the head,

54
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.190
but behind the scenes she began visiting clubs and asking managers to give a by

55
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:01.720
a chance.
This resulted in a short term Gig in Hoboken club,

56
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.100
but the job isn't lost.

57
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.060
Frank got in a fight with the proprietor and was shown the door when he was 17

58
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.520
Dolly and Marty frank,

59
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.850
$65 so that he could buy a portable address system and sheet music arrangements.

60
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.060
This Putin may step ahead of other aspiring club performance.

61
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.700
Frank then blazer began collecting orchestrations.

62
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.310
He later explained his strategy bands needed them.

63
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.210
I had them if the local orchestra wanted to use my arrangements and they always

64
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.810
did because I had a large run up to the minute collection and they have to take

65
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.890
singer Sinatra to in this way frankly managed to establish a foothold in the

66
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.724
local club scene.

67
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.180
His hero was bing Crosby and he tried to copy the Crosby sounds,

68
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.090
but when he noticed virtually every other singer out there was doing the same

69
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:43.890
thing,
he made the decision to establish his own unique sounds

70
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.100
and the summer of 1934 the 18 year old frank and that 17 year olds in that seat,

71
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:56.160
Carol Bob Beta,
she came from a poor family in Jersey City and New Jersey.

72
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.160
Nancy was sitting on her front porch doing her nails.

73
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:03.450
When frank walks up to her with a Ukulele in his hands,
his opening line was,
Yo,

74
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.320
what about me?

75
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.890
I could use a medicare to the spark was lit and the romance blossomed over the

76
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:08.820
next four years.

77
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.150
They lived one town apart and frank would frequently take the bus to visit and

78
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.170
data.
Nancy.
During these years,
frank was building his thinking experience.

79
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.270
Most of the gigs would pay around $2 a night.

80
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.960
Sometimes he performed at roadhouses for nothing more than a sandwich or a box

81
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:22.794
of cigarettes.

82
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.820
Frank's first break came on September the eighth 1935 when you auditioned for a

83
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:31.440
spot on the NBC radio show,
Major Bowes aunties,
original amateur hour.

84
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.010
This show was broadcast live from the Capitol Theater in New York City.

85
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.370
Frank teamed up with a group called the three flashes and they became the

86
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.720
Hoboken four.
They performed the big Crosby hit shine ans one spot on the show,

87
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:46.520
which was sort of a 1930s for runners to American idol listeners.

88
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.600
Phones in to vote for their favorite acts ends.

89
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:50.340
The Hoboken four proved so popular.

90
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.730
The major Bowes invited them to return several times.
However,

91
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:57.420
the radio show appearances didn't lead to any lasting success.
Frank,

92
00:04:57.421 --> 00:05:00.210
Roseanne into Hoboken and soon found himself once again,

93
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.260
begging for jobs anywhere he could find them.
In 1939 frank and Nancy,

94
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.850
they were married not long after that.

95
00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:08.040
Frank was singing in a cloud called the rustic cabin.

96
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.360
In the audience was Harry James and big bands leader who was auditioning for a

97
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:13.140
lead singer.

98
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.160
James was impressed with Frank's waived walking a lyric invited Sinatra to

99
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:18.270
audition the next day,

100
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.150
although there were a lot of others who showed up for the job.

101
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.240
When frank opened his mouth,
the matter it was settled,

102
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.470
he made his debut with the Harry James Band on June the 30th 1939 at the

103
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.830
hippodrome theater in Baltimore.
The rest of that summer and into the fall,

104
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.710
he toured with a band too enthusiastic audiences.

105
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.400
By 1940 Sinatra's popularity.
It was growing steadily.

106
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.300
Then he changed bands midstream jumping at the chance to sign on with the more

107
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.940
famous Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.
The deal though,
frank,

108
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:46.890
structurally it was hardly in his favor.

109
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.390
He would give up a third of his earnings for life plus 10% for Tommy's agents,

110
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.490
but all the young frank who had recently become a father wanted was to sing and

111
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.280
be famous and besides would end up with more each week.

112
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.680
Then he was getting with the old band with this band.

113
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.130
Frank traveled across the country and he ended up in Hollywood,
California.

114
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.210
In 1942 the battens with Sinatra out front made a cameo in the MGM movie ship,

115
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.880
a high with band behind him,

116
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.360
frank and built up his profile if ad on the radio in concert halls,

117
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.710
on TV and in the movies.

118
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.450
By the end of 1942 he was one of the most well known singers in the country and

119
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:21.800
he had replaced bing Crosby,

120
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.490
has billboard's top of band's vocalist and cut his first record.

121
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

122
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.890
<v 0>By the ends of 1942 frank had made up his mind to go it alone.</v>

123
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.800
He was clearly the star attraction of the Tommy Dorsey band,

124
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.900
so while they may have needed him,

125
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.900
he was more than able to hold an audience by himself.

126
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.350
When he told Dorsey of his intentions,
the band leader was furious,

127
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.580
but frank was determines.
Finally Dorsey relentless.
He did insist,
however,

128
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.910
the contract for a third of Sinatra's earnings would remain in place.

129
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.510
Frank decided that he would worry about that contract later.
For now,

130
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.970
he would get out before Dorsey,
you changed his mind.

131
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.180
It's an ultra meet his solo debut on his 27th birthday,

132
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.830
December the 12th 1942 in the audience that night was Bob Whiteman manager of

133
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:07.880
the paramount theater.

134
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.150
He was so impressed that he asked Benny Goodman the king of swing,

135
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.930
if he minded having frank on a bill with him at the paramount Goodmans response

136
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.780
as well as who the hell is Frank Sinatra?
Well,

137
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.910
he would soon find out it's an ultra.
Is it parents?

138
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:21.590
Is that the power amounts made history.

139
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.800
It was this thoughts if the type of hysteria epitomized by screening and

140
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:28.130
fainting girls that would later creed Elvis and the Beatles.

141
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.720
When frank at the stage the theater erupted with wild scenes that had never been

142
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:36.650
seen before in 1944 with his popularity.
Absolutely soaring.

143
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.630
Frank became a father for a second time.

144
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.680
Frank Sinatra Jr joined older sister Nancy at home while their fathers Star

145
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.130
capture sending his record sales tops of the buildings and he was the most

146
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.750
requested voice on the radio

147
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.250
with the end of World War II Sinatra's fame to yet another level.

148
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.030
He was contracted by Hollywood to star in a series of musicals each more popular

149
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.960
than the last.
Yes.
In his personal life,
things were starting to unravel.

150
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.840
He was away from home so much that he hardly saw his wife and children.

151
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.850
Then in 1947 frank met and fell in love with a beautiful and glamorous actress.

152
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:11.684
I have a gardener.

153
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.960
The two began a very public affair which lost Sinatra wrote quite a lot of

154
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:18.020
popularity among the older demographic.
At the same time,

155
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:21.980
the 31 year old crooners voice was beginning to show signs of strain and he was

156
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:26.030
also being attacked by mainstream media outlets for his support of liberal

157
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:29.780
causes.
It was sad that his fight against segregation was communist.

158
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:34.220
Inspired reporters also began claiming that he dodged the draft during the war.

159
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.550
Leading the printer sells on Sinatra was reporter Lee Mortimer.

160
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.290
On April the eighth 1947 the two men came face to face at Ciro's nightclub in

161
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:42.920
Hollywood.

162
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.340
Frank went straight up to the reporter and calls him a fruit and then proceeded

163
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:47.630
to use him as a punching bag.

164
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.300
Frank's bodyguards quickly broke his ankle with Sinatra yelling.

165
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.570
Next time I see you,
I'll kill you.
You know,
little degenerate.

166
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.730
Mortimer had frank arrested and charged with assault and battery.

167
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.460
The charge resulted in Sinatra's gun pan is being reversed.

168
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.290
Mortimer later sued for $250,000 and the case was eventually settled for 9,000

169
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.523
<v 1>yes,</v>

170
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.040
<v 0>it's an option that never seemed to appreciate that it's choice of associates</v>

171
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:16.270
could impact his career.
In 1947 not long after he beat up on Morton,

172
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.660
he went to Havana to meet with the mobster boss.
Lucky Luciano.

173
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.930
This mob connection was to stick with him for the rest of his life.

174
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.430
Despite the affair with Ava Gardner,
Nancy Sinatra stuck by her husband's side.

175
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.960
She gave birth to a third child,

176
00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:33.220
Christina on father's day in 1948 but the new edition did not bring frank back

177
00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:36.520
into the family,
fold his fascination with Ava.
It was greater than ever.

178
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.770
I'm like Nancy,
if it could match him,
drink for drink,

179
00:09:38.771 --> 00:09:40.810
cigarette for cigarettes and Tantrum for Tantrum.

180
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.310
They were an ideal hard living couple.
That's how I'm living there.

181
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.170
It had a price.
In 1949 Frank's voice gave out.

182
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.240
That's combines with his public reactions.

183
00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:53.350
He was outrageous affair led to plummeting record sales and shot numbers.

184
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.160
His radio show was dropped and MGM canceled his movie contract.

185
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.850
It looked like the show was over for the man who had been cool with the voice in

186
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:04.630
1951 Nancy finally divorced from frank in short order Sinatra,

187
00:10:04.631 --> 00:10:07.150
Mary David Gardner.
He had formalized his love life,

188
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.870
but it seemed there was nothing he could do to resurrect his failing Korea.

189
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.300
The public had simply become disenchanted with him.

190
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.280
Viewing him as a washtub has been.

191
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.860
<v 1>It was.
It was</v>

192
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.640
<v 0>during his period of hardship in the early 1950s that Sinatra read a book called</v>

193
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.280
from here to eternity by James Jones.

194
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.550
When he learns that a movie version was being plans,

195
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.890
he became convinced that this could be his road back to the top.

196
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.580
He set his sights on securing the role of private Angela Majia.

197
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.610
Frank secure doesn't audition and then proceeded to convince the movies,

198
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.710
producers that he was magic.

199
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.620
He won the pass and he gave the performance of his life.

200
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.860
Sinatra won the Oscar for best supporting actor.

201
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.550
The following month he signed a recording contract with capitol records and just

202
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.990
Korea was back on track.

203
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.460
It's a bit as the losing his fame and then pouring it back had changed Sinatra

204
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.650
as a singer.
He now worries heart on his sleeve.

205
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.410
Sharing in his performances is in a struggles.

206
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.670
He became the first as the best musical storyteller and it was this ability the

207
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:09.330
brought him the male audience,
but he had never had before in Sinatra.

208
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.870
They swarm for tend to tough guy that they wanted to be.
It's an ultra.

209
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.400
His marriage to Ava Gardner was tumultuous and detention in divorce in 1957 but

210
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:21.930
his Korea was going from strength to strength by the late 1950s he was well and

211
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:22.890
truly back on top.

212
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.950
His album come fly with me was number one and it was on the chance for an

213
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.560
impressive 71 weeks.
At the same time,

214
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:31.830
his movie career was also hitting new heights in the man with the golden arm.

215
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:35.130
He gave an extraordinary performance as heroin addicted misfit.

216
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.390
The 1960s then saw an emergence of new kinds of popular music,
rock and roll,

217
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.220
realizing that he couldn't ignore us.

218
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.810
Sinatra tried to accommodate by bringing out uptempo albums in the early sixties

219
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:49.710
snapchat also became a staunch supporter of John F.
Kennedy.
However,

220
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.260
Franklin maintains his association with key mob figures.
Attorney General.

221
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:56.830
Robert Kennedy was concerned that not brought these underworld criminal figures

222
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.120
too close to the presidents.

223
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.670
He managed to sever the relationship between JFK and Sinatra.
Sinatra.

224
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.330
Last great movie role was 1962 is the Manchurian Kansas in which he played a US

225
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:09.730
army officer Ben Marco.
After that,

226
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.830
he appeared to become bored with movies and developed a reputation as a trouble

227
00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:16.060
maker.
On the set is this engine had switched to Las Vegas,

228
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.770
then you gambling capitol of the nation.

229
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.400
Then he and his buddies became known as the rat pack along with Dean Martin.

230
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.260
Sammy Davis,
Jr Peter Lawford,

231
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:27.490
Joey Bishop Sinatra performed the mixture of standup comedy and lounge music at

232
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.690
the best casinos in town.
Then in December of 1963 Sinatra is fun.

233
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:36.190
Loving existence was jarringly interrupts his when his 19 year old son Frank Jr

234
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.280
was kidnapped and held for $240,000 ransom Sinatra appeal to Robert Kennedy who

235
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:45.660
called in the FBI.
The ransom was paid.
Frank Jr was released in the has prompted.

236
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:50.500
He caught with most of the ransom being returns in 1964 while filming von Ryan's

237
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:51.550
express and ultra notice,

238
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.520
the young actress named Mia Farrow hanging around the set,

239
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.060
the star of a popular nighttime soap opera Faro,

240
00:12:57.061 --> 00:13:01.630
which is 19 scene became Sinatra's constant companion via 30 year age gap

241
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:04.660
provided Pennsy for the gossip columnists do get their teeth into.

242
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.930
In 1965 to 50 year old singer won an Emmy for the best television special of the

243
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:09.971
year following year.

244
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:14.080
He recorded one of his most popular albums of all time strangers in the night.

245
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.160
That same year,
1966 Sinatra and mia were married.
However,

246
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.090
me as mellow hippie style was out of step with Frank's hard living ways and the

247
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:26.380
union and he lasted for 16 months following the divorce and finding himself in

248
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:27.970
danger of being yesterday's news.

249
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.900
Sinatra began looking for a new musical direction that will allow him to compete

250
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:34.510
with the hard edge rock and roll that was popular at the time.

251
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.680
He found what he was looking for in the song my way written by Paul Anka.

252
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.640
The song which frank recorded in 1969 has become his anthem.

253
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.620
Then in 1972 the shock of his legion of fans,
Sinatra announced his retirement.

254
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.830
He said that he was tired of show business and once it nothing more than to

255
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:51.850
relax,
read,

256
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.510
and think that just as he repaired to take his life easy life threw another

257
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:58.450
curve ball his way.
He was summoned to a congressional hearing.

258
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:00.820
Keen to investigate has connections with the mafia,

259
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.550
lack of evidence for us that you congressional committee to drop its

260
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.470
investigation and the heat went off.

261
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:08.490
Sinatra reassignment though it never sat easily with frank cans.

262
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.260
By 1973 it was once again on the comeback trail.

263
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.350
This time is focus would be on concert performances.

264
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.220
He leapt back into the public consciousness with a television special called old

265
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:19.870
blue eyes is back from there.

266
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.230
He went on to fill all of the concert halls and big arenas across the country.

267
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.590
He's saying directly to his audience,
dressed in a fitted Tuxedo.

268
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.980
Just see it always done.
In 1976 the 60 year olds,

269
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:34.270
Sinatra married for the fourth time,
his bride was 45 year old Barbara Marks.

270
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.180
She traveled with him as he played two ever growing crowds.

271
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.810
By the 1980s the chairman of the board is a bonafide icon.

272
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.060
He went on to help in Ronald Reagan's campaign.

273
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.920
Then in 1988 the 73 year old pads with some of his former Ratpack performance.

274
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.840
The audiences absolutely loved it.

275
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.930
In 1993 Frank Nitti use of a technological innovation to produce an album

276
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.400
entitled Frank Sinatra do apps.
He sang along with 13 top recording artists.

277
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.150
They were at different places and times the record became a number one pattern

278
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.420
of best seller and outsold any of his previous recordings.

279
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.720
It's an ultra lived out the last five years of his life in relative quiet.

280
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.650
He was plagued by ill-health often going into hospital with cardiac complaints.

281
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.090
Then the dementia set in.

282
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.260
He passed away on May the 14th 1998 at a hospital in Los Angeles with the

283
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:22.460
official cause of death being Hashtag on May the 15th the Empire State Building

284
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:26.410
was turned to blue in New York and the casinos in Las Vegas came to a holes in a

285
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.690
tribute to the man who very uniquely did it his way.

286
