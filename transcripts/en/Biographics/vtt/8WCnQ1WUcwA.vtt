15
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>James and Nancy were extremely pious people.</v>

16
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:51.331
<v Speaker 1>So young.</v>

17
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Fred grew up in a very religious household.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nancy volunteered at the local hospital as a nurse's aide.</v>

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>She had a deep love for helping others,</v>

23
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>which also was a huge influence on fret.</v>

24
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>In later years,</v>

25
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Fred would fondly remember how his mother required everyone in the family to</v>

26
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>hand knit sweaters every Christmas for the troops during the war years.</v>

27
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>This family ritual instilled in fresh I love for sweaters,</v>

28
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>and they became his trademark during his TV show Mr Rogers neighborhood in years</v>

29
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.724
<v Speaker 1>to come.</v>

30
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Every one of the hundreds of sweaters he wore on the show was [inaudible] by</v>

31
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Nancy.</v>

32
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>The extended Roger's family was very close with fred developing a special bond</v>

33
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>with his grandfather.</v>

34
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>The two spent many hours together where the old man would encourage friends to</v>

35
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>be himself expressing all of his feelings and emotions freely.</v>

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>This had a great impacts on Fred who fondly recalled how his grandpa had told</v>

37
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>him that he made his day special by simply being himself.</v>

38
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Those words made fred feel special and he made it his mission in life to how</v>

39
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>other people feel the same way.</v>

40
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 2>When he was</v>

41
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

42
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Fred's parents adopted a baby girl named Elaine.</v>

43
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Fred loved being an older brother even though elaine proved to be quite a</v>

44
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>handful away from the love and the security of his family.</v>

45
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

46
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.833
<v Speaker 1>Fred struggles,</v>

47
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>he found it difficult to make friends,</v>

48
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>often finding himself isolated and alone the other children made fun of the fact</v>

49
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>that he was overweight and that he doesn't join in with that rough and tumble</v>

50
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

51
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

52
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>he became rather quiet and shy.</v>

53
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>His parents told him to ignore the negative feelings that were welling up inside</v>

54
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>of him and focus on positive things.</v>

55
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>This only made fred felt more heart and more confused in later years.</v>

56
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>One of his key messages to parents was that children's feelings need to be</v>

57
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged rather than ignored.</v>

58
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>The outlet that Fred stumbled upon two releases,</v>

59
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>pent up emotions was the piano when he was just a few years old,</v>

60
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>dense.</v>

61
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>He would play the piano in order to sooth fret by five.</v>

62
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>He was playing it himself.</v>

63
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>He was a natural lands within a few years.</v>

64
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>He was so proficient that he would play for guests and family members.</v>

65
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>His acts would also include a puppet show.</v>

66
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Fred founds these outlets allowed him to express his feelings in a way that</v>

67
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't upset other people.</v>

68
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>When he was 10,</v>

69
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Fred's grandmother bought in a piano of his own,</v>

70
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>a $25 pump organ.</v>

71
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>He spends hours each day practicing with his time and the keys being the only</v>

72
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>periods that he felt like he was being his true self and his early teens.</v>

73
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Fred also became obsessed with photography,</v>

74
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>developing his own brands in a basement darkroom.</v>

75
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>His favorite thing to capture on film with the expressions on other people's</v>

76
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>faces,</v>

77
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.981
<v Speaker 1>the Rogers family,</v>

78
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 1>they attended the Presbyterian Church in Detroit.</v>

79
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>From the very start,</v>

80
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Fred was eager and engaged.</v>

81
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He was entranced by every seven finding a personal connection to the message of</v>

82
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and the personality of Jesus Christ.</v>

83
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>It inspired in him the deep felt desire to serve and help other people.</v>

84
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>One Fred entered high school.</v>

85
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>He was just a shy and unsessioned around his peers.</v>

86
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Whenever he did,</v>

87
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

88
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>develop a very unlikely friendship.</v>

89
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Friends,</v>

90
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it could never have imagined that he would become close friends with someone</v>

91
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:00.050
<v Speaker 1>like Jim.</v>

92
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.883
<v Speaker 1>Standout.</v>

93
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Standout was the popular and talented athletes and a football player when Jim</v>

94
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>suffered a football injury.</v>

95
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:06.461
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

96
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>he was confined to a hospital bed for a period of weeks.</v>

97
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>The school assigned Fred to deliver Jim's homework to him in hospital,</v>

98
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>as well as making notes for him in class,</v>

99
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.380
<v Speaker 1>gym and Fred spent time together.</v>

100
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Friends came to appreciate each other.</v>

101
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Fred could see through Jim's exterior images,</v>

102
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>the sports hank and Jim could appreciate Fred's quiet,</v>

103
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful nature.</v>

104
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>When Jim was released from the hospital,</v>

105
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.550
<v Speaker 1>the friendship continued through Jim's influence.</v>

106
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>The other students came to realize that Fred wasn't so bad after all,</v>

107
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Fred's hadn't changed,</v>

108
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but now the other students that's Mba himself without harassing him from this,</v>

109
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>he learns a powerful lesson that he strived to impart to millions of children</v>

110
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>through his TV show decades later.</v>

111
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>The yourself without shame.</v>

112
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>As a result of his new found acceptance by his peers,</v>

113
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Fred's confidence grew in leaps and bounds.</v>

114
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>He became involved in school activities,</v>

115
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>becoming editor of the school yearbook and the newspaper.</v>

116
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>By the end of his senior year,</v>

117
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>he was president of the student council.</v>

118
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>He came to the respected rather than marks for his quiet,</v>

119
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful nature.</v>

120
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>During his high school years.</v>

121
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Fred develops another relationship that was pivotal in his life.</v>

122
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>George Allen was an African American friend of the family,</v>

123
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>as well as sharing Fred's passion for music.</v>

124
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Georgia was also a passionate pilots.</v>

125
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>He shares his enthusiasm with threads,</v>

126
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>teaching him to fly.</v>

127
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>While Fred never developed George's passion for flying,</v>

128
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>he was in tranced by Fred's love of imparting his aeronautical knowledge.</v>

129
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It was then that he learns what it was to be a true teacher.</v>

130
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Upon graduating from high school,</v>

131
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.330
<v Speaker 1>it was Fred's intention to go to seminary and become a minister.</v>

132
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be his natural calling,</v>

133
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>allowing him to serve others just as his parents had grieved him.</v>

134
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

135
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.440
<v Speaker 1>he felt a need to achieve a college degree and his love of learning inspired him</v>

136
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 1>to enroll at Dartmouth College for his freshman year.</v>

137
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.570
<v Speaker 1>He decided to study the romance languages.</v>

138
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 1>After a year,</v>

139
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.860
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

140
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>he decided that what he really wanted to study with music,</v>

141
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Dartmouth had no program,</v>

142
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>was worthy of Fred's talents.</v>

143
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>So he transferred to rollins college.</v>

144
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It was during an initial tour of the college that Fred ran into his future wife,</v>

145
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Sandra,</v>

146
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Joanne,</v>

147
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>but Sarah became hugely impressed with Fred's piano playing ability and he</v>

148
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>quickly became a part of his circle of friends.</v>

149
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Fred majored in music composition and minored in French language.</v>

150
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Prior to graduation in the summer of 1951,</v>

151
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Fred returned home on vacation.</v>

152
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>He's still fully intended to attend a theological seminary after graduation,</v>

153
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>but everything changed when Fred saw his first television show on the small</v>

154
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

155
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Fred watched is two men,</v>

156
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 1>three pies into each other's faces.</v>

157
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>In an instance,</v>

158
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>he saw the potential in this new medium to educate millions of people once at</v>

159
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.201
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

160
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>He was appalled at the low brow way that television was currently being used.</v>

161
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Fred was so passionate about his desire to change the way that television was</v>

162
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>being used,</v>

163
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>that he decided on the spot to give up on his ideas,</v>

164
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:53.520
<v Speaker 1>to join the seminary and pursue a career in television.</v>

165
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Upon graduating from rollins with this music degree in hands,</v>

166
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Fred applied to NBC television in New York and asked if they had any positions</v>

167
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>

168
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>He was hot by a producer named Charles Polo.</v>

169
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Check.</v>

170
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Fred moved to New York full of enthusiasm only to find that his days were spent</v>

171
00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:13.770
<v Speaker 1>running errands.</v>

172
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.050
<v Speaker 1>He experienced the west and his colleagues,</v>

173
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.120
<v Speaker 1>especially those in positions of power.</v>

174
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.901
<v Speaker 1>In later years.</v>

175
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Fred remembered how one boss severely chastised him in public for forgetting to</v>

176
00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>put sweetener and his coffee.</v>

177
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.530
<v Speaker 1>He tried mostly in vain to bring a positive vibe to the office.</v>

178
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Fred's favorite NBC show was opera theater.</v>

179
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.710
<v Speaker 1>The show collaborated with famous composers to put on operas that were shown</v>

180
00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Speaker 1>across the nation via the tube.</v>

181
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Fred worked his way up to becoming a floor manager on the show.</v>

182
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 1>He was in charge of timing the programs,</v>

183
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.240
<v Speaker 1>making sure the cameras are ready and letting the actors and know when to stop</v>

184
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 1>and went to start.</v>

185
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.430
<v Speaker 1>His attentive personality allows them to shine in this role for it.</v>

186
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Also became floor manager on a handful of other shows.</v>

187
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 1>He came to appreciate the wide variety of uses that television could be put to.</v>

188
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.640
<v Speaker 1>One of the shows he worked on was the Gabby Hayes show.</v>

189
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>He watched and absorbed the lesson is hae spoken to the camera as if there was</v>

190
00:08:03.631 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 1>only one person on the other side of the screen.</v>

191
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately though Fred became frustrated,</v>

192
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.080
<v Speaker 1>NBC wasn't showing any interest in moving into the use of television as a medium</v>

193
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.943
<v Speaker 1>of education,</v>

194
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.120
<v Speaker 1>he decided to leave and pursue his passion to bring music and education to the</v>

195
00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:18.870
<v Speaker 1>masses,</v>

196
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.860
<v Speaker 1>especially children.</v>

197
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>In 1953,</v>

198
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:21.871
<v Speaker 1>Fred and Sarah,</v>

199
00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:23.250
<v Speaker 1>who had married the previous June,</v>

200
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.910
<v Speaker 1>heard of a new television station that was opening in Pennsylvania.</v>

201
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.370
<v Speaker 1>It was to be called Wq ed.</v>

202
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.820
<v Speaker 1>They decided that French should apply and he was offered a job as a program</v>

203
00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>

204
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Wq Ed was the first community television station in the United States.</v>

205
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Fred saw it as the ideal opportunity to shape educational content.</v>

206
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 1>A month before w qbd was scheduled to go live,</v>

207
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.840
<v Speaker 1>the owners decided that a children's program would be a valuable addition to the</v>

208
00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:49.470
<v Speaker 1>lineup.</v>

209
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Fred's and the young woman named Tracy carry the stations.</v>

210
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Secretary were tasked with coming up with something.</v>

211
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.440
<v Speaker 1>The they came up with was called the children's corner.</v>

212
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>The children's corner started out very simply while Fred worked behind the</v>

213
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>scenes,</v>

214
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 1>JC introduced free children's educational films.</v>

215
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>On the night before the show,</v>

216
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>ad station director,</v>

217
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Dorothy Daniel gave fred a small tiger purpose.</v>

218
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 1>As a good luck charm,</v>

219
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>fred quickly dubbed this puppet is Daniel without telling anybody,</v>

220
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Fred positioned himself behind the backdrop,</v>

221
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>which was simply a painted sheet.</v>

222
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>As JC began introducing the first episode live on the air,</v>

223
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 1>he cut a slit in the sheets and Danielle appeared on screen and it's began</v>

224
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:26.120
<v Speaker 1>conversing with JC.</v>

225
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>The bobbitt proved to be a hit with audiences and puppets became a regular</v>

226
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>feature of the show on this shape.</v>

227
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:32.491
<v Speaker 1>Fred's.</v>

228
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 1>He was obviously the puppeteer as well as the organ player in order to rush</v>

229
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 1>between the cells and the organ he took to wearing his trademark white tennis</v>

230
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

231
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.450
<v Speaker 1>The children's going.</v>

232
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>It became so successful,</v>

233
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>but fred and JC became local personalities.</v>

234
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>The show even came to the attention of NBC Fred's former employer when they're</v>

235
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>head of religious programming.</v>

236
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>When's on a four week vacation and BBC invited Fred and JC to fly to New York to</v>

237
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>appear live.</v>

238
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Every Saturday morning.</v>

239
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 1>They returned to Pittsburgh for the Monday morning show,</v>

240
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 1>the NDC Saturday show now exposed fred to a national audience.</v>

241
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.700
<v Speaker 1>He began receiving hundreds of thousands of fan letters.</v>

242
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>The NBC executives quickly secured Fred and Josee as regulars.</v>

243
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>They also had larger,</v>

244
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:15.801
<v Speaker 1>more professional puppets made NBC put pressure on Fred and JC to quit w qed and</v>

245
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>go daily on that channel,</v>

246
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but the power would not relinquish their loyalty to the original channel and</v>

247
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>they continue to travel back and forth.</v>

248
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Despite his grueling TV schedule,</v>

249
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Fred continued to pursue his dream of achieving a theological degree.</v>

250
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 1>He attended the Pittsburgh theological seminary and studied in the late hours</v>

251
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>finally achieving his masters in divinity.</v>

252
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 1>The most influential course he took was a masters counseling course during when</v>

253
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 1>she worked with children to see how they reacted to puppet interactions.</v>

254
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>He found that children reacted very differently with puppets than they would</v>

255
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 1>with real people and would more easily open up and communicate with a puppet.</v>

256
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Fred was ordained in 1962.</v>

257
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 1>His vocation was to work with children and families through the mass media.</v>

258
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.271
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>

259
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>television plans were put in action for a Fred's hosted show for the</v>

260
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Presbyterian church,</v>

261
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 1>but before he got off the grounds,</v>

262
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Fred received the call that would change his life.</v>

263
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>The cool came from Fred Rainsboro,</v>

264
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.950
<v Speaker 1>who was in charge of children's programming in Canada.</v>

265
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.840
<v Speaker 1>He wanted Fred to come to Canada,</v>

266
00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:17.201
<v Speaker 1>earns,</v>

267
00:11:17.201 --> 00:11:19.210
<v Speaker 1>puts on a 15 minute daily show,</v>

268
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 1>specifically aimed at children and using puppets as well as his musical talents.</v>

269
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge risk,</v>

270
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Fred and Sarah,</v>

271
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.790
<v Speaker 1>who now had two young children,</v>

272
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.840
<v Speaker 1>but it was everything that Fred had been working towards and so they bit the</v>

273
00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:33.520
<v Speaker 1>bullet and moved to Toronto,</v>

274
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.540
<v Speaker 1>but when he arrived,</v>

275
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Fred was shocked to realize that Rainsboro wants them to appear in front of the</v>

276
00:11:37.841 --> 00:11:39.730
<v Speaker 1>camera rather than behind the scenes.</v>

277
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Rainsboro had seen Fred work one on one with children and knew that he had a</v>

278
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:45.220
<v Speaker 1>special gift to connect with them.</v>

279
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Over the next 12 months.</v>

280
00:11:46.661 --> 00:11:50.350
<v Speaker 1>The two Fred's develops the programs concept with Rogers finally agreeing to</v>

281
00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:51.280
<v Speaker 1>appear on screen.</v>

282
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>The show was to be called Mr Rogers is one word.</v>

283
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Rainsboro felt that this would make it less formal to children.</v>

284
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 1>The show was set up in a neighborhood with whimsical sets and puppets for Fred</v>

285
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>to interact with and then named.</v>

286
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Ernie was brought in as the Babbitt here.</v>

287
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 1>The show was a huge success in Canada.</v>

288
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.031
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

289
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:09.330
<v Speaker 1>after the initial 12 month contract was up for Ed,</v>

290
00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>decided to move his family back to the United States to be closer to family,</v>

291
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.560
<v Speaker 1>but even that Pittsburgh Frederick waited patiently until Wq ed had room in</v>

292
00:12:21.561 --> 00:12:24.290
<v Speaker 1>their schedule for another children's educational program.</v>

293
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.680
<v Speaker 1>After two years during which he held an education job with the church,</v>

294
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.730
<v Speaker 1>the funding came through for Fred to host his own show on w qed,</v>

295
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Mister Rogers' neighborhood.</v>

296
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.710
<v Speaker 1>The show premieres in October of 1966 for the first year.</v>

297
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.910
<v Speaker 1>It was essentially a rehashing of the Canadian version of Mr Rogers within 12</v>

298
00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:41.151
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

299
00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:41.451
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

300
00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the format had expanded and the show had been picked up by the sears company as</v>

301
00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:46.154
<v Speaker 1>a major sponsor,</v>

302
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.440
<v Speaker 1>enabling it to go to a national audience.</v>

303
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Frederick wrote the theme song,</v>

304
00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:51.020
<v Speaker 1>which was to become famous.</v>

305
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Won't you be my neighbor?</v>

306
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.530
<v Speaker 1>The revamped show added more characters,</v>

307
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.011
<v Speaker 1>puppets,</v>

308
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:56.660
<v Speaker 1>and places to visit each episode.</v>

309
00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Fred would go out of the studio and visit a new place.</v>

310
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>The second national series in 1969 rolled out in full color in the third season.</v>

311
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.890
<v Speaker 1>The show which had become hugely popular,</v>

312
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:10.550
<v Speaker 1>was taken over by the Public Broadcasting Service or PDS.</v>

313
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 1>The first round of Mr Rogers neighborhood continue to production for a total of</v>

314
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.720
<v Speaker 1>eight seasons and 455 episodes.</v>

315
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.920
<v Speaker 1>By then Fred's.</v>

316
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.190
<v Speaker 1>He was ready to take a break and so the show transitioned to reruns,</v>

317
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.940
<v Speaker 1>but Fred's.</v>

318
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.080
<v Speaker 1>We're still busy ever.</v>

319
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:24.801
<v Speaker 1>The perfectionist,</v>

320
00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:28.520
<v Speaker 1>he took the opportunity to fix things that he didn't like from older episodes.</v>

321
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.870
<v Speaker 1>New original seasons of Mr Rogers neighborhood began filming in 1979.</v>

322
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Between then and 1990 3:15 new episodes were produced per season which shows</v>

323
00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:42.320
<v Speaker 1>linking together and carrying through one overall theme for the entire season.</v>

324
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.710
<v Speaker 1>The huge popularity over the show was due to Fred's casual,</v>

325
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.690
<v Speaker 1>inviting and empathetic nature.</v>

326
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.703
<v Speaker 1>He never acted,</v>

327
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.900
<v Speaker 1>always striving to be genuine and honest.</v>

328
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.540
<v Speaker 1>His main method of teaching was through his own example.</v>

329
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.670
<v Speaker 1>As many of as audience members grew up with him,</v>

330
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.820
<v Speaker 1>the show would starts with Fred's talking directly to his child audience about</v>

331
00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:00.560
<v Speaker 1>the subjects.</v>

332
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Then it would transition to a field trip which had been filmed earlier.</v>

333
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Then it would be back live where Fred would move into the neighborhood of make</v>

334
00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:10.670
<v Speaker 1>believe this was a whimsical place where the characters could learn,</v>

335
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.480
<v Speaker 1>explore them,</v>

336
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.370
<v Speaker 1>and to act out specific scenarios.</v>

337
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Then Fred would move out of the neighborhood of make believe and discuss what</v>

338
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:20.540
<v Speaker 1>had happened in the neighborhood that day from start to finish.</v>

339
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.000
<v Speaker 1>The emphasis of the show was on communication,</v>

340
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.700
<v Speaker 1>opening up to others and exploring feelings.</v>

341
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Fred was not afraid to discuss any topic that was relevant to children,</v>

342
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.950
<v Speaker 1>including divorce and death.</v>

343
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.020
<v Speaker 1>In addition to these heavy topics,</v>

344
00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Fred also encouraged children to have fun exploring the world around them and</v>

345
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.980
<v Speaker 1>keeping that curiosity alive in 2001.</v>

346
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Fred retired at the age of 71 after 31 seasons and 865 episodes.</v>

347
00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:46.970
<v Speaker 1>If Mr Rogers neighborhood,</v>

348
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.680
<v Speaker 1>the show was officially over,</v>

349
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>but Mr Rogers was still a familiar tv because of reruns.</v>

350
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

351
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Who was best known for his landmark TV show,</v>

352
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Fred Rogers invested his time and energy into other work as well.</v>

353
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.980
<v Speaker 1>He was involved in the Children's book business,</v>

354
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>held seminars for parents and produced many documentary style features.</v>

355
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.520
<v Speaker 1>The most well known of these was a series called Mr Rogers,</v>

356
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>heroes and old friends,</v>

357
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.130
<v Speaker 1>new friends for the show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fred's traveled all over the United States talking to admirable people.</v>

359
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Fred authored a total of 36 children's books dealing with issues ranging from</v>

360
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 1>fear of going to the hospital to potty training.</v>

361
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Fred's passion for children's education led to his involvement in advocacy work</v>

362
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 1>in 1979.</v>

363
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.350

366
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:37.094
<v Speaker 1>government issues.</v>

367
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 1>In 1969,</v>

368
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>He appealed to a group of senators in an effort to stop the federal government's</v>

369
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 1>cutting funding to pbs.</v>

370
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Largely as a result of his efforts,</v>

371
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 1>the funding was actually increased by $10,000,000 in 1984.</v>

372
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 1>He was called as an expert witness in a case between sony and the universal city</v>

<v Speaker 1>studio.</v>

374
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.780

375
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>which was the forerunner of the video recorder.</v>

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>This new technology threatens hollywood's and universal brought the case to stop</v>

377
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:04.490
<v Speaker 1>sony on the grounds of copyrights.</v>

380
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.890

381
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.110
<v Speaker 1>a year after his retirement from television.</v>
