ways and scheming.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.550
Self-Interest allows him to manipulate his way into a position of power within

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.130
the Nazi hierarchy has it less personal secretary,

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.880
he became the fewer as gatekeeper and just most trusted confidant.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.260
In today's biographics,

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.280
we're examining the life and the death of Martin Bormann.

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.780
Martin Bormann was born into the Prussian town of Vagal Oban on June the 17th

13
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:49.980
1900 his parents,

14
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.180
Theodore and Antonio were of the Lutheran faith with Theodore being a post

15
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:54.960
office workout.

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.830
It was his second marriage and he already had two children when Martin came

17
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:02.670
along.
When Martin was three years of age,
his father,
he died.

18
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.500
Antonia soon remarried.

19
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.250
The child showed little interest in his schooling and in his early teens.

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:12.450
He dropped out to study it and agricultural grade high school.
Those studies,

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.520
they were caught short when he signed up with the army.

22
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:18.360
Upon reaching the age of 18 he joined the 55th field artillery regimens as a

23
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.930
gunner.

24
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.860
He was too late to see any action during the first world war seven garrison duty

25
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.420
until he was discharged from the army.

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.490
In February of 1919 Boldman moved to Micklin Borg where he secured a position as

27
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:33.540
a farmer state manager.
He also joined a volunteer group known as the fry call,

28
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:36.510
which was formed to to guard the local funds from pillaging.

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.720
The group also fought against those that were considered betrayers of Germany

30
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.410
during the war.
The Communists Bowman was now a stocky,

31
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.550
belligerent young man as he quickly learns the trade of the bully.

32
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.720
On March the 17th 1924 Boardman was found guilty of being an accomplice to the

33
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:54.870
murder of a fellow fry core member named Walter Katto.

34
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.230
Katto was believed to have grossed in another member to the French authorities

35
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.240
for conducting sabotage operations.

36
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.440
That man was subsequently executed by the French in retaliation bombing and

37
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.260
several others.
Got a hold of Catalans.

38
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.260
Took him to an isolated field where they beat him and cut his throat.

39
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.820
Boardman spent a year in prison for the crime being released in February of 1925

40
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.860
he wrote sounds of the farm job in Micklin.

41
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.960
Buggins also joined a paramilitary off shoot of the Nationalist Socialist

42
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.300
Workers Party known as the Front Barn.

43
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.513
<v 2>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.880
<v 0>In May of 1926 [inaudible] left the farm and moved in with his mother.</v>

45
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:37.990
Read Uber Weimar 99 to 27 he joined the Nazi party proper.

46
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.130
He obtained a job with a weekly newspaper which was edited by Nazi party

47
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:42.670
official.

48
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.000
Before long Bowman was acting as press manager for the Nazi party in the state

49
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:46.720
of Thuringia.

50
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.900
There was soon to discover however that he lacks the public speaking ability for

51
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:52.990
the position and he was transferred to the position of business manager.

52
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.340
In 1928 Borman moved to Munich where he works for the essay insurance office.

53
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.911
At that time,

54
00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:01.380
the Nazi party had set an insurance scheme to come the members who were injured

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.340
in clashes with other political groups.

56
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.980
This was necessary because existing insurance companies,

57
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.450
they refuse to come to the Nazis.

58
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.380
Bowman was instrumental in setting up the internal insurance scheme.

59
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.370
It required each party member to pay a premium payouts to injured parties.

60
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.150
They were solely at the discretion of Bowman himself.
The position of power.

61
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.510
This came with holding the purse strings for insurance payouts allowed Bowman to

62
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.200
establish a reputation as a financial expert among Nazi party members.

63
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.460
It also caused many who received pals to feel personally indebted to him well in

64
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.150
September.
The second is 1929 bolden married 19 year old gut.

65
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.200
A Bush ghetto was the daughter of a key Nazi official who was responsible for

66
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.020
settling disputes within the party of Hitler was regularly in attendance at the

67
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.680
Bush House.
Since he was a witness at a wedding,

68
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.060
it was through the Bush connection.

69
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:49.060
The Bowman was able to come onto the fewer as radar.

70
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.920
On January the 30th 1933 Hitler became chancellor of Germany.

71
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.670
There's men that the various departments of the Nazi party became absorbed into

72
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:03.630
the state system.

73
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.560
As a result of woman suddenly found himself about a work he approached Hitler's

74
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:12.120
deputy Rudolph Hess in search of a job has made him his personal chief of staff.

75
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.140
He proved himself to be a valuable asset working behind the scenes to iron out

76
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.490
bickering within the party.

77
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.910
He also took care of mundane routine and organizational duties,

78
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:24.120
allowing us to focus on public relations and future planning.

79
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.610
As he worked tirelessly on bureaucratic manners,

80
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.210
Borman took every opportunity to get close to Hitler by doing so,

81
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.500
he was building up his own personal power in the summer of 1935 he took

82
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:37.980
advantage of an opportunity to increase his standing with Hitler when the fury

83
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.670
decided that he needed to upgrade his holiday retreat at Berchtesgaden.

84
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.910
Boardman was given the job of overseeing the remodeling work.

85
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.960
He was determined to bring the job in ahead of schedule in order to score points

86
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:50.100
with headlines.
As a result,

87
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.000
he pushed the workers relentlessly and the job was completed incredibly quickly.

88
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.730
Hefner was pleased with the work,
but he had another demand.

89
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.600
They were to be no neighbors on the mountain and it was up to Borman to get rid

90
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.790
of them.
Most of them were simply able to be bought off,

91
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:06.360
but those who refused at their property confiscated and was sent to a

92
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:07.680
concentration camp.

93
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.010
Then when headline complains that there was no shade at his new retreat,

94
00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:15.690
Borman rush to have they linden tree brought in and planted in the pouring rain

95
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.590
head was beginning to view him as a man who could be relied upon to get things

96
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.543
done.

97
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.260
There is efficiency,
hardwork,
reliability and absolute loyalty.

98
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.940
Boardman and Hitler's trust,

99
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.630
he was entrusted with the job of overseeing Hitler's finances and sat out to the

100
00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:37.970
adult Hitler endowment of German Industry.

101
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.410
This was a ruse to force industrialists to provide gifts that ended up lining

102
00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:45.410
the pockets of the Nazi hierarchy with schemes like this.

103
00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:49.340
He owns the gratitude of Nazi top brass because he always stayed in the

104
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:49.880
backgrounds.

105
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.290
Bowman was not seen as a threat to Hitler's henchmen who are constantly jostling

106
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.030
among themselves for power.
In fact,

107
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.390
for them it was easy to focus only on his inadequacies.

108
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.110
He was far from physically imposing being a rather squat heavy set man.

109
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.840
He liked any of the sophistication required to be a top player.

110
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.730
Having neither the strength of personality,

111
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.860
all the speaking ability to persuade others,

112
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.270
all of those who simply wrote him off.
We'd come to regret this underestimation.

113
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.750
Perhaps the best insights we haven't.

114
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.140
Mormons character comes from Hitler's or I commit to stuff.

115
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.570
Oms and war production,

116
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.280
Albert Speer and is 1970 book inside the Third Reich says the following,

117
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.600
most of the powerful men on to hip low watched each other jealously like

118
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.050
pretenders to the throne.

119
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.890
This none of them recognize the threats in the shape of trustee.
Bowman,

120
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.610
he had succeeded as representing himself as insignificance while imperceptibly

121
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.450
building up his best eons.
Even among so many ruthless man,

122
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:46.070
he stood down to buying his brutality and coarseness and the culture which might

123
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.630
have put some restraints on him,

124
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.590
and in every case he carried out what type of Hitler had ordered or what he

125
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:55.190
himself had gathered from hitless hints a subordinate by nature.

126
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.570
He treated his own subordinates as if he were dealing with cows and oxen.

127
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.130
Borman suddenly tried to control his own immediate boss,
Rudolph Hess.

128
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.180
He would only allow others to access has if he,

129
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.020
one of his staff members were presence.

130
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.830
In March of 1938 Hitler returned to his home country of Austria.

131
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.440
Borman accompanied him with a special task to perform.

132
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.640
Hedler told him to buy up his Hitler's childhood home along with the school that

133
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.474
he had attended.

134
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.440
This is something Bowman did successfully a month later and organized a special

135
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:28.130
presence of the fear to celebrate the neatest 50th birthday high in the mounds,

136
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.050
NC bill's a tea house for Hipaa.

137
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.590
It costs some 30 million marks as treasurer of the Nazi pass.

138
00:07:34.591 --> 00:07:37.190
Bowman was extremely liberal and dishing out money.

139
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.900
He gave 50,000 bucks each month to the SS for entertainment expenses.

140
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.990
Nothing was too much trouble for hitting his girlfriend Eva Braun.

141
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.090
Bowman would order silk underwear,
perfume,

142
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:51.290
and jewelry from Paris despite his lavish spending on behalf of others,

143
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.640
Bowman was not so popular among Hitler's in a circle.
In fact,
most people,

144
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.780
they detested him.

145
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.320
He had no friends to speak of and treated those under him with a British

146
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:03.080
dominance that made onlookers recoil.
Now,

147
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:06.320
just before we get into the main event today,
which is of course the war.

148
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.460
I wants to take a moment to tell you about Vince.
Sarah watches,
look,

149
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.390
and here's the truth,
yet they need a watch.
You've got to phone,

150
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.450
you can check the time,
see that easily anytime you want.

151
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.730
But here's the thing about watches today,

152
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:22.220
they're not really about telling the time.
It's all,

153
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.400
they're more kind of like jewelry for many of the men who don't really wear

154
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:29.090
jewelry like myself.
I need wear a wedding band and a watch.

155
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:31.640
So I love having a good looking watch.
It's,
I've,

156
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.310
I've in fact a few to choose from.
It's something about style.

157
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.790
It's a statement about you and what you like and that sort of thing.

158
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.150
And in a way for me,
it's sort of a connection to the past.

159
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:42.620
I mean to all those great people do,

160
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.800
we'll wristwatches they didn't have iPhones to check ins.
I,

161
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.630
I quite liked that historical connection.

162
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.130
Right now I'm wearing even Sarah Chronograph,
uh,
as well as keeping perfect time.

163
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.160
It's also got a timer,
those three back down,
right?

164
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.160
I'll just do a close up B roll shot right here,
but they don't look good.

165
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:01.230
They also serve a function.
I mean,
yes,

166
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:04.980
your iPhone also has a timer that it doesn't look this good thing.
It does it.

167
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.470
Now I pick down to watch with a blue and silver combination,

168
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:10.200
but there's loads of options on their website.

169
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.710
You'll be sure to find something that suits your personal style.

170
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.100
Unlike many other watches on the markets.
Then salary,

171
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.040
clearly it's not about minimalist style.

172
00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:21.210
That's more about that classic good look of a watch.
Like I say,
to me,

173
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:23.910
I like that historical connection.
So here's the thing.
Many of us,

174
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:27.390
we could wear tee shirts and sweatpants to work if we wanted to,

175
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.330
but we choose not to.
We wear a shirt.

176
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.400
We up our game just because we can integrate.

177
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.580
Ways to do that is with INSERRA watch.

178
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:38.640
Go check out the full range below this video,

179
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:41.640
through the link in the description and thanks to Vince area watchers for

180
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:44.720
sponsoring.
Let's get into the war.
Showery.

181
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.200
When war broke out in September of 1939 Hitler insisted the Bowman was always

182
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:57.360
close by.
Ready to do his master's bidding.

183
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.850
His role was as deputy to the deputy fuhrer,

184
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.750
Rudolf Hess and the chief of staff of the fear.

185
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.480
A headquarters here effectively became a middle man between the fear and the

186
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:11.400
next level down of the Nazi hierarchy.
In May of 1941 Bowman's star,

187
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:14.250
it was suddenly and unexpectedly elevated.

188
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.720
Rudolf has Hitler's trusted deputy and head of the party chancellery deserted to

189
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:22.860
Scotland by playing in order to open peace negotiations with the Antis
headlight.

190
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.930
He was outraged at the betrayal of Hess.

191
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.110
He had a number of colleagues of house arrested as the deputy to the trader.

192
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:29.760
Bowman would have been in danger himself.

193
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.930
He did everything he could to distance himself from Hassey,

194
00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:36.030
even tormented has his wife trying to get her evicted from our home.

195
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.420
It was only when she appealed to head blood by way of Eva Braun that the cold

196
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.400
called and off with the loss of house.

197
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:45.450
There was now an open position at the very top of the Nazi hierarchy and Hitler

198
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:48.030
was all too willing to allow Bowman to step into it.

199
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.310
Baldwin was now closer to Hipaa than ever.

200
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.300
He became the fewer is constant shadow,
always walking,
a few steps behind,

201
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.690
but always presence.
As far as Hitler's personal view of bombing goes.

202
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.440
Spare relates that he considered him to be a rogue.
It's a Philistine Stein,

203
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.230
but he went on to say that he didn't have anyone more efficient,

204
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.910
so they had quoted Hitler is saying,

205
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.110
I know he will carry out every order right down to the last detail and see it

206
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:11.400
through to the end.

207
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.900
Boardman was genuinely convinced that Hitler was Geminis Salvation.
As a result,

208
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:19.020
he was completely dedicated to the fulfillment of the viewers goals.

209
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.700
As the war in the east progressed,

210
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.060
he became the gatekeeper for the generals in the access to Hitler.

211
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.430
Before reporting to the [inaudible].

212
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.680
They would have to brief Bowman who would then tell them what not to reveal.

213
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:30.150
To hit that we'll hit let's look is water.

214
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:33.720
The nations of Europe Bowman way interest his own wall within Germany,

215
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.790
his enemy with the challenges of Christiandom,

216
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.020
he stated that National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable and

217
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:42.930
proceeded to close churches and arrest priests,
so it will,

218
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.060
as it became increasingly powerful.

219
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:50.061
Bowman actively works to hold back the careers of others who were a part of

220
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:53.860
headless in a circle,
including Gehring gobbles and him not.

221
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.220
His tentacles reached into every area of the regime,

222
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.330
including the VM ox where he actively encouraged young offices to spy on the Su

223
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.650
is woman's dance to you towards the enemies of the state.

224
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.780
The Jews and Eastern European Slavs was straight down to the party line.

225
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.490
They were useful false labor,

226
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.820
but over and above that they would just better off dead.

227
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.380
He was also opposed to education is claiming that every educated person is a

228
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:21.250
future enemy.

229
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.730
By 1943 Bowman was more than simply a shadow to the [inaudible].

230
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.930
He was also a subtle manipulator,

231
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.990
fiercely guarding access and guiding Hitler towards the policies that he most

232
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:42.670
favored as one as a master manipulator.
Martin Bormann was a terrible womanizer.

233
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.420
His marriage was still in tact with his wife,
eventually bearing him 10 children.

234
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.380
However,
he also had a string of mistresses and fathered numerous other children.

235
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.580
He viewed it as his duty to the German Reich to produce as many offspring as

236
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:55.240
possible.

237
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.680
In 1943 Bowman fell madly in love with an actress named Manya barons.

238
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.000
He decided that seeing her on the side wasn't enough and z wanted to have as his

239
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:06.760
second wife.
As a result,
he wrote a letter to his actual,

240
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:09.970
I've gutted telling her about his latest conquest.
It red.

241
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.140
I've fallen madly in love with her and took her against all her resistance.

242
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.570
Now she's mine and his,
I'm a lucky fellow.

243
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.960
I feel incredibly happily married twice over now.

244
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:24.190
I must take double and triple cad that I stay healthy.
You know,
Martin,

245
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.630
his desire to live a polygamous life was backed up by the Nazi belief that

246
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:32.530
people of good German stock should sow their seed as liberally as possible.

247
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.630
Gutta something have no say in the matter.

248
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.480
When it came down to the final solution to the Jewish question,

249
00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:40.150
the euphemism used for the mass killing of the Jews.

250
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.240
Borman made sure that it was never openly discussed.

251
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.440
On one occasion when hemlock telephones and with a report that 20,000 Jews had

252
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:52.150
been eliminated in a week needing the set target Bowman,
he became furious,

253
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:55.390
admonishing him lets you never discuss such things over the phone.

254
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.320
In 1943 Bowman was appointed as personal secretary.

255
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.110
We things beginning to fall apart as far as the war was concerned.

256
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.560
The fury needed Bowman's blinds loyalty more than ever.

257
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.100
There was grilling discontents within the Nazi ranks and Bowman.

258
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.080
He was determined to weed it out.

259
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.290
On July the 20th 1944 an attempt was made to kill Hitler in its wake Bowman.

260
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.440
He sprung to life firing off taxes in order to mobilize the retaliation.

261
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.550
Swift justice was enacted with more than 200 people being convicted and

262
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:26.980
subsequently execute it.
Some of these executions,

263
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:29.590
they were films for Hitler to view it is leisure.

264
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.190
The assassination attempt gave head let the opportunity to crack down on

265
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.040
everyone who opposed him under the direction of Borman.

266
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.630
More than 20,000 people would be executed all sent to concentration camps over

267
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:44.560
the next nine months for lack of loyalty to the Fiera hydro him load.

268
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:48.100
The leader of the SS was the final barrier between Bowman and hiphop,

269
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.580
then promoted him to the position of Supreme Ami leader.
However,

270
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:55.880
with the allies now driving towards Berlin on two fronts,

271
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.370
it was a promotion of dubious merit.

272
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.130
Borman had maneuvered things to bring about the promotion,

273
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:03.560
seeing it as a means to sideline him lot.

274
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.390
By early 1945 Borman was at the height of his power having negated the power of

275
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:11.630
him like he was now second only to add off Hitler.
By now.

276
00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:15.020
The writing though it was well and truly on the wall,
the Third Reich,

277
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.610
it was doomed and even bomb new ed.

278
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.503
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

279
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.180
<v 0>On January the 16th 1945 Hitler and his inner circle,
they moved underground.</v>

280
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:28.681
The fear.

281
00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:32.500
Rebecca was located under the gardens of the Reich chancellor rebuilding in the

282
00:15:32.501 --> 00:15:35.050
center of Berlin.
When his oldest son,
Martin,

283
00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:39.010
sent him a letter in March of 1945 asking if he thought the war could still be

284
00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:39.490
one.

285
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:44.490
He replied that even a dying lion could still strike out with its paws with the

286
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:46.750
Russians and the Americans.
Closing in on Berlin.

287
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.870
Borman sent out constant messengers for the troops to fight on.

288
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.620
He wrote now the capable will be distinguished from the incapable.

289
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.760
The born elders have smashed all obstacles and dart supremely ready for action.

290
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.690
What would have made plans to fly Hitler out of Berlin on this 56th birthday?

291
00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:05.440
April the 20th 1945 but Hitler refused to leave the bunker.

292
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.070
That very often in the bunker was rocked for the first time by Soviet bombing,

293
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.910
loyal to the very ends Bowman,
right the following and his diary.

294
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.830
During those last days in the bunker,

295
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.180
we will stand and fall with the Fiera loyal onto death.

296
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.800
On April the 29th Barman became a signatory to hit plus last will and testament

297
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.100
had lower also named him as executer of the estate.
That evening,

298
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.960
Hitler married eve abroad the next day.

299
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:31.990
Then you knew I had just committed suicide in accordance with the fear is

300
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:32.711
instructions.

301
00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:37.360
Bowman was named party minister making him the highest ranking Nazi left alive.

302
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.620
Admiral Karl Donitz was appointed as the new president of Germany with Berlin.

303
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.270
Now in the grip of the enemy and allied radio station announced that hemlock was

304
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:50.470
undertaking peace negotiations and outraged.
Bowman.
He wrote the following.

305
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.830
Others believe they must act out of superior understanding.

306
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:58.360
They sacrifice the Fiera shame on them.
They're honor is disloyalty.

307
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.380
Woman called an emergency meeting of the top ranking men that were left in

308
00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:06.010
Berlin when the brother in law of Eva Braun general failed and didn't show

309
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.780
Borman became furious yelling that he was to be hunted down and arrested.

310
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.410
Fagin was found drunk and in the company of a woman who was not his wife in his

311
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:17.890
luggage was found foreign currency.
He was returned to the bunker,
runs,

312
00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:19.570
executed on Bowman's orders.

313
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.680
Born left the bunker on May the first he was accompanied by three others.

314
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.580
Their challenge was to break through the Soviet and sacraments of the inner
city.

315
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.290
They made their way to a Uba and tonight,

316
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:30.940
which they used to get to the spree river.

317
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.400
Bowman was hiding behind a tank when it was hit by artillery fire.

318
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.750
This knocked him to the grounds.
The group eventually made it across the river.

319
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.520
One of them,
the Hitler youth leader,

320
00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:43.690
our taxman separated from the others accident soon Sora Sovia patrol,

321
00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:47.540
so he retraced his steps looking across to where the others had been.

322
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.000
He saw two bodies on a bridge.

323
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.290
He later identified one of them as being Martin Bormann.

324
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.860
Later Ray Red Army lefthanded general claims that he had been brought to the

325
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:57.330
diary of Martin Bormann,

326
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:00.090
which had been found lying in the street by the same bridge.

327
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.160
That's when men were sent to the area,
his body.
It was not found.
27 years later.

328
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.280
In 1972 the remains of two men were found by construction workers and a station

329
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:15.060
in West Berlin dental checks were said to confirm that one of them was Martin

330
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.601
Bormann.
However,

331
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:19.710
the dentist was working from memory off to a quarter of a century which costs

332
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:22.680
stouts on the accuracy of his analysis.
However,

333
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:24.780
the body also has a collarbone injury,

334
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:29.700
which was consistent with an accidents that Bowman had sustained in 1939 but

335
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:32.430
it's got us in Salsa Med glass fragments in their jawbones,

336
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.940
which would have been consistent with them having taken cyanide.

337
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.330
The West German authorities deems these three pieces of evidence sufficient

338
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:42.330
enough that they announced that Martin Bormann was dead.

339
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.440
The death was confirmed in 1998 when DNA testing was done on fragments of the

340
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:47.910
skull.
11 years later,

341
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.470
the remains of Martin Bohman hit us shadow wiscat it and the Baltic Sea.

342
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.020
