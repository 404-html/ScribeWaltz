1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>There's the group at the center of major conspiracy theories have been accused</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>of pulling the strings of major governments around the world for inserting</v>

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 1>symbols into such prominent places.</v>

4
00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>As the US dollar bill and conspiracy theorists have claims that everyone from</v>

5
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:18.741
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles to Tom Brady to Kanye West are more recent members of the centuries</v>

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>old society.</v>

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt the Illuminati have impacted welder fast even if just by being</v>

8
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>at the center of conspiracy theories.</v>

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>But where did this group get it start?</v>

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the man behind the secret society.</v>

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Johann Adam.</v>

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.673
<v Speaker 1>Why stopped</v>

14
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Johann Adam Weishaupt,</v>

15
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>who was born into an academic household in Bavaria.</v>

16
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>He came into the world on February the sixth,</v>

17
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:49.811
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

18
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>48 is the son of a law professor.</v>

19
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>When she was only five years old,</v>

20
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>his father passed away,</v>

21
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>leaving him to be raised by his grandfather.</v>

22
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Also a law professor,</v>

23
00:00:58.181 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Weiss helps grandfather kept caps,</v>

24
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>the Boeing engaged in scholastic activities.</v>

25
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>His grandfather was a proponent of the enlightenment movements and the thoughts</v>

26
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>and philosophies promoted by enlightenment thinkers,</v>

27
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>came to greatly influence Weiss hops during the 17th and 18th century.</v>

28
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Enlightenment movements.</v>

29
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Intellectuals emphasized the importance of reason and individualism over</v>

30
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

31
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>You might also hear the enlightenment referred to as the age of reason among the</v>

32
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 1>movements most famous thinkers with John Locke and Isaac Newton when he was</v>

33
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 1>seven years old.</v>

34
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Ice Helps Education expanded beyond his grandfather's teaching.</v>

35
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>The family was Catholic and why sap to began attending a jesuit school.</v>

36
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>He was a voracious reader and by the time he was 20 years old,</v>

37
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>he has and his doctorate in law.</v>

38
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He began teaching law bars.</v>

39
00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Within a year he became the beneficiary of the dissolution of the very religious</v>

40
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>order that had educated him.</v>

41
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Political maneuvering coupled with cultural changes made.</v>

42
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:55.480
<v Speaker 1>The jesuits are a threat to the power of some European leaders,</v>

43
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>at least in their eyes.</v>

44
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>The order was suppressed in several countries and even the pope issued a brief</v>

45
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 1>suppressing the jesuits because of the order suppression in Seventeen,</v>

46
00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:09.451
<v Speaker 1>73 wise helped was able to move from being a professor of secular law to being a</v>

47
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 1>professor of Canon law at the University of English start before the suppression</v>

48
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>only jesuits towards Canon Law now waste,</v>

49
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>which could be a professor,</v>

50
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>but he nonetheless found himself as the only non clergy member serving.</v>

51
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

52
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>although the order has been suppressed,</v>

53
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 1>they still wielded considerable power at the university and Weiss hubs and his</v>

54
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment influenced ideas well.</v>

55
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 1>We hit some roadblocks as a result,</v>

56
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>helped grew to dislike clerics.</v>

57
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 1>He was frustrated and he wanted a way to spread the words of the enlightenment</v>

58
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>without being stonewalled by the chair.</v>

59
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Ouch.</v>

60
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>So he decided to start his own society about what was the goal of this society.</v>

61
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>This is the great object held down by this association as the means of attaining</v>

62
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it is illumination enlightening the understanding by the son of reason which</v>

63
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>will dispel the clowns of superstition and prejudice initially why sobs didn't</v>

64
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.060
<v Speaker 1>want to start his own secret society he had wanted to join the free masons,</v>

65
00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>is a group that he thought would line up nicely with his passion for reason over</v>

66
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.324
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

67
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately he decided that the free masons weren't exactly what he wanted</v>

68
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and so he took the leap and started his own society.</v>

69
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look to the freemasons for inspiration in rituals and organizational</v>

70
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:26.591
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

71
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>though overtime,</v>

72
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>especially after I stopped,</v>

73
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>ended up joining the freemasons.</v>

74
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>The two groups became more linked in the minds of many,</v>

75
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>especially conspiracy theorists to start a society.</v>

76
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Why Sampson began reaching out to like minded men.</v>

77
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He had befriended at university,</v>

78
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but they had to be young men.</v>

79
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Anyone over 30 was just too unlikely to be influenced by new ideas and I tapped.</v>

80
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>He wanted the men who joined to be true believers in the enlightenment ready to</v>

81
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>start spreading the ideals of reason and spreading them as high up as they</v>

82
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

83
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>The group of men first match in May of 17,</v>

84
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>76,</v>

85
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.830
<v Speaker 1>only five of them arrived in the forest that first night carrying torches and</v>

86
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 1>ready to embark on their quest to spread their ideas to the world to be</v>

87
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>initiated into the Illuminati.</v>

88
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Why Sally wanted his members to experience being reborn this way,</v>

89
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>they would be leaving behind their lives before joining the Illuminati and to be</v>

90
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>able to fully immerse themselves in their commitment to the new secret society.</v>

91
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>The initiation rights included sacrifices and mystical elements who did men</v>

92
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>unknown identities in darkened rooms are hallmarks of such rights.</v>

93
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Games have been made that the Illuminati initiation rights.</v>

94
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I've taken the sacrifice element to its most extreme stage,</v>

95
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>the sacrificing of an actual human being to be initiated and reborn.</v>

96
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the new member would have to experience death and be reborn and</v>

97
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>actually killing someone would give them an insight into the experience of</v>

98
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

99
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but the initiation rite is also sent to have given many members the experience</v>

100
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>of death and rebirth through the killing of an animal.</v>

101
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati would put an animal on top of the new member,</v>

102
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>kill the animal and just let it bleed to death on top of the new member soaking</v>

103
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>in the animal's bloods,</v>

104
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>encouraged rebirth and the understanding of life,</v>

105
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>death and knowledge overall.</v>

106
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Why Sally did not want the Illuminati to remain just a small academic society</v>

107
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>that operated in an echo chamber,</v>

108
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:25.381
<v Speaker 1>though he wanted it to reach the highest echelons of society with members both</v>

109
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>influencing political leaders and even the coming political leaders themselves,</v>

110
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>but he also didn't want the society to grow full of men.</v>

111
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't trust until you weren't truly dedicated to the course.</v>

112
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So the men that mets that first night,</v>

113
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to be agreed to by the five members present at night as well as prove</v>

114
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>themselves to be from families of high standing and wealth.</v>

115
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>The latter two requirements would help with myself,</v>

116
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>skull to get his ideas moving up the societal ladder and into the minds of</v>

117
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>intellectual families and society.</v>

118
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.601
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

119
00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>the order's famous name.</v>

120
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It didn't to ice out right away the first name boy,</v>

121
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.780
<v Speaker 1>his secretive group was the perfect lists,</v>

122
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>a name that they actually stuck with for two years.</v>

123
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>The idea that a man is perfectible was part of the group's ideals.</v>

124
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Even American founding father Thomas Jefferson appreciated this trait of ice</v>

125
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>arts and design ideas,</v>

126
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>stating why Sam's seems to be an enthusiastic philanthropist.</v>

127
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>He is among those,</v>

128
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.921
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

129
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>the excellent Richard price and priestly also are who believe in the indefinite</v>

130
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>perfectibility of man.</v>

131
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he may in time be rendered so perfect that he will be able to govern</v>

132
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>itself in every circumstance,</v>

133
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>so as to engine none to do well,</v>

134
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the goody can to leave.</v>

135
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Government had no occasion to exercise their powers over him and of course to</v>

136
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>render political government useless before the name Illuminati was officially</v>

137
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>adopted.</v>

138
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

139
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Sam's also thought about naming the group the be order that's in the Nazi was</v>

140
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>ultimately decided upon.</v>

141
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>And why Sam's took the owl as the group symbol.</v>

142
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

143
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:53.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 1>why did you choose now?</v>

145
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is the significance of this bird?</v>

146
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Now Minerva,</v>

147
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 1>the goddess of wisdom was accompanied by an owl.</v>

148
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>The Owl was away for ways,</v>

149
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>helped to indicate the intellectual basis for the secret society while still</v>

150
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>keeping its symbolism just to be coded.</v>

151
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>The new name was a callback to the occult beliefs within the Spanish culture</v>

152
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>during medieval times,</v>

153
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>alchemists and magicians were believed to be imbued with a light that signified</v>

154
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the presence of a higher power within within the society.</v>

155
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 1>The members took nicknames.</v>

156
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.241
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

157
00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Subs as the head of the order was spartacus,</v>

158
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>while other adopted names from members included,</v>

159
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>a Jackson Tiberius in 17,</v>

160
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>77.</v>

161
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Why's helped found a new avenue for recruiting.</v>

162
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>He was accepted into a free masons group in Germany and use their society as a</v>

163
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>place to find well connected society.</v>

164
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:46.631
<v Speaker 1>Men who were already acquainted with and interested in secret societies.</v>

165
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>The men who were welcomed in were told the following.</v>

166
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Should you see might power false honor excess seek vote.</v>

167
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>We would work for you to provide your temporal advantages.</v>

168
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>We will bring you as close to the throne as you wish and then turn you over to</v>

169
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of your folly,</v>

170
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>but our inner sanctuary remains closed to such,</v>

171
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 1>which who do you want to learn?</v>

172
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom wants to learn to make mankind's more clever,</v>

173
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>better free and happy,</v>

174
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>then be thrice welcomed by us.</v>

175
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>The men who joined new found order found themselves a part of a group that was</v>

176
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>split into distinct levels as much as waste helped refine the principles of</v>

177
00:08:22.071 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>rationalism and individualism related to the enlightenment movements,</v>

178
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>the men who were a part of his fault,</v>

179
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>where restrictors in their knowledge about what was going on within their own</v>

180
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:31.724
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

181
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati had a hierarchy within the structure and the members at the</v>

182
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>bottom reported to those.</v>

183
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>At the top there were three ranks of men,</v>

184
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>novice minerval and illuminated minerval eliminate them interval where at the</v>

185
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>top of the Illuminati is pecking order than I am inspired by the Roman goddess</v>

186
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>of wisdom.</v>

187
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>They spied on each other and on the political and economic goings on in society.</v>

188
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Bringing news back to the order and to helping the Illuminati move forward and</v>

189
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>its goals of influencing the top tiers of society.</v>

190
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize sufficiently what it means to rule to rule in a secret society,</v>

191
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>not only over the lesser or more importance of the populace,</v>

192
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but over the best of men over men of all ranks,</v>

193
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>nations and religions to rule without external force to unite them in</v>

194
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>dishonorably to breathe one spirit and soul into them.</v>

195
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Men distributed over all parts of the world in his first year,</v>

196
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.490
<v Speaker 1>so they'll even ask.</v>

197
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It didn't grow by leaps and bounds.</v>

198
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Initially,</v>

199
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>they found only a few dozen interested in qualified men to join.</v>

200
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.700
<v Speaker 1>They know that it's just 60 by 78 80,</v>

201
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.541
<v Speaker 1>but that year,</v>

202
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>why stopped added amendment to the Illuminati who proved himself to be</v>

203
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>especially helpful in gaining new members and he also attracted a new level of</v>

204
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>respect for the secret society and this new member.</v>

205
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 1>He came from.</v>

206
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Why Sampson recruiting grounds in the freemasons,</v>

207
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>baron adult Conega had been a member of the freemasons,</v>

208
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 1>but he had risen as far as he could go within their ranks.</v>

209
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>So when he heard of y soft and his new smaller group,</v>

210
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>he saw an opportunity to have real sway over what was going on in the</v>

211
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.324
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

212
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>He also likes the Illuminati is relationship with mysticism and forming the</v>

213
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 1>order why Sam's had relied in part on mystic texts.</v>

214
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>He read the mysteries of the seven sages of Memphis and the Kabbalah and the two</v>

215
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:09.421
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>

216
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It's made an impact on how he viewed the world around him.</v>

217
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Baron Canoga was also a students of such ideas and liked that why salvage</v>

218
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>brought their influence into the Illuminati when he joined gonna get eagerly</v>

219
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>read the texts required of new members,</v>

220
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>most consistent of works that were banned in the conservative Catholic Bavaria.</v>

221
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

222
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>contigo read the text so quickly that we had to stall for time.</v>

223
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.080
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want can I get to reach the illuminated minerva level so quickly?</v>

224
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>So he put off Grenada.</v>

225
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

226
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 1>he tried to come up with new ideas for readings and required actions,</v>

227
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>but kinda figured out that y sub two is trying to delay his achievements of the</v>

228
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>highest level when he brought this up to wise,</v>

229
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.111
<v Speaker 1>help wise,</v>

230
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:46.411
<v Speaker 1>helped,</v>

231
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 1>was willing to listen.</v>

232
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It was also willing to listen to Canadians.</v>

233
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:54.450
<v Speaker 1>New ideas for the order for one Canadian said the order needed a rearrangement</v>

234
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>of its hierarchy.</v>

235
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>He suggested bringing in new levels under the existing three levels.</v>

236
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>The end result of this was 13 ranks of Illuminati members each subdivided within</v>

237
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the original three levels.</v>

238
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>The three new overarching levels have the names of the nursery,</v>

239
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>the messianic grades,</v>

240
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and the mysteries can also used his influence to change.</v>

241
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:15.021
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

242
00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 1>How strong messaging about the church and about religion.</v>

243
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>He realized that such a strong stance might be hampering the group's ability to</v>

244
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:27.621
<v Speaker 1>grow and recruit new and powerful members after the church wielded much power in</v>

245
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Bavaria in the 18th century,</v>

246
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 1>and even the promise that our society with secrets might not be strong enough</v>

247
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>assurance for men from powerful families to risk joining.</v>

248
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Why subs listens to you.</v>

249
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Can you get.</v>

250
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.770
<v Speaker 1>And the Illuminati,</v>

251
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:43.680
<v Speaker 1>they benefited from an organization of just 60.</v>

252
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>They grew to 200 by 17,</v>

253
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>82,</v>

254
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 1>then the group group to 3000 members by 1784.</v>

255
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati or Dorsey spread beyond varia membership now included Hungary,</v>

256
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Poland,</v>

257
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.643
<v Speaker 1>and Italy.</v>

258
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 1>But having that many members spread throughout a number of countries made it</v>

259
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 1>harder and harder to keep things quiet,</v>

260
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.790
<v Speaker 1>and if they're very purpose was to infiltrate and influence political thought</v>

261
00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:08.624
<v Speaker 1>and actions,</v>

262
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.690
<v Speaker 1>then of course the upper echelons of society would start to notice them.</v>

263
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.230
<v Speaker 2>In 1794,</v>

264
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.850
<v Speaker 1>that group became a problem.</v>

265
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Then members of the Illuminati were sending correspondence back and forth and</v>

266
00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:27.560
<v Speaker 1>the governments have their eye out for his writings with internal Illuminati</v>

267
00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:29.900
<v Speaker 1>ideas and policies were intercepted in Bavaria.</v>

268
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also been thought that this interception was set up by this point wise</v>

269
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.250
<v Speaker 1>helped handsome,</v>

270
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.870
<v Speaker 1>disgruntled members within his ranks.</v>

271
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.600
<v Speaker 1>When we first started the organization,</v>

272
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.920
<v Speaker 1>he told some members that would be a supernatural communication if they achieved</v>

273
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.110
<v Speaker 1>the highest level within the society,</v>

274
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.540
<v Speaker 1>but plenty of people who had achieved this by 17,</v>

275
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:52.541
<v Speaker 1>84 and there was no supernatural communication to be hat baron can Nigga and why</v>

276
00:12:53.631 --> 00:12:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Sam's.</v>

277
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.510
<v Speaker 1>They also had a major disagreements.</v>

278
00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have the same idea about some of the societies rituals and their</v>

279
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:03.710
<v Speaker 1>arguments culminated in Canoga leaving the secret society.</v>

280
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.720
<v Speaker 1>The same year he left the Illuminati.</v>

281
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.930
<v Speaker 1>The Bavarian government banned all secret societies.</v>

282
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.580
<v Speaker 1>That was in 1784,</v>

283
00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:12.890
<v Speaker 1>which was the same year that the membership had exploded.</v>

284
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.963
<v Speaker 1>By the next year.</v>

285
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.040
<v Speaker 1>The Bavarian government took it a step further.</v>

286
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:21.120
<v Speaker 1>They banned the Illuminati specifically as part of the Illuminati banishment.</v>

287
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.580
<v Speaker 1>The government began reading.</v>

288
00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:26.090
<v Speaker 1>The documents have known Illuminati documents started to be published,</v>

289
00:13:26.091 --> 00:13:28.010
<v Speaker 1>and it's this secret society and its membership.</v>

290
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.510
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't so secret anymore.</v>

291
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Public officials became known as members putting that livelihoods and societal</v>

292
00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:34.310
<v Speaker 1>rankings on the line.</v>

293
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.880
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati simply couldn't function with its membership.</v>

294
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Being known throughout all of this society building and government influencing</v>

295
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.990
<v Speaker 1>why sapped had still been working as a professor at the University of English</v>

296
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:46.520
<v Speaker 1>stocks,</v>

297
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but when the government banned the Illuminati,</v>

298
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 1>he was forced to flee his home and leave behind his job wise,</v>

299
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.300
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't kind to the governments,</v>

300
00:13:53.301 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 1>to governments of any sorts of not just Bavaria,</v>

301
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 1>so it is not surprising that they were not pleased with his writings.</v>

302
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 1>So just how strongly did he feel about the governments?</v>

303
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

304
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.690
<v Speaker 1>take this quote,</v>

305
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.230
<v Speaker 1>when man lives under government,</v>

306
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>he has fallen,</v>

307
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.860
<v Speaker 1>is worth is gone and his nature tarnished when the illuminati were bands from</v>

308
00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Bavaria.</v>

309
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Why Sandra was forced to fleet to go to another part of Germany.</v>

310
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.141
<v Speaker 1>That waste helped,</v>

311
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:17.060
<v Speaker 1>was protected by a sympathetic duke.</v>

312
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Duke Ernest not only provided political protection for Weiss ops,</v>

313
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but he also gave him a pension that's allowed him to live without working.</v>

314
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Even though the Illuminati had been disbanded in various [inaudible],</v>

315
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:31.730
<v Speaker 1>kept pushing the ideas that had led him to start the secret society in the first</v>

316
00:14:31.731 --> 00:14:32.300
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

317
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.570
<v Speaker 1>He began rising ultimately publishing for books about the history of the</v>

318
00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati and defending.</v>

319
00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It's existence.</v>

320
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.380
<v Speaker 1>The books were intended both to defend himself and to perhaps encourage new</v>

321
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.190
<v Speaker 1>growth for the Illuminati and the province of Gota.</v>

322
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.750
<v Speaker 1>There's one way helped passed away in 1830.</v>

323
00:14:47.751 --> 00:14:50.810
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati had all but disappeared from the world.</v>

324
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to operate even as a secret society.</v>

325
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>When major world powers,</v>

326
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>they simply want you gone.</v>

327
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.330
<v Speaker 1>While the Illuminati may have disappeared,</v>

328
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>at least in membership in Europe.</v>

329
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 1>The group by no means disappeared from the world's imagination and conversations</v>

330
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>based on today's conspiracy theories and the prevalence of the Illuminati and</v>

331
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:11.114
<v Speaker 1>pop culture.</v>

332
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It can be argued that why south succeeded in creating a secret society that had</v>

333
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>an influence on the world.</v>

334
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Dan Brown's massively popular novels feature the Illuminati in angels and</v>

335
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:21.680
<v Speaker 1>demons.</v>

336
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Brown pits the Illuminati against the Catholic church in a modern setting.</v>

337
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.121
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the book,</v>

338
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 1>they use churches and artwork to commit atrocities,</v>

339
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>relying heavily on coded symbolism benders.</v>

340
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:35.960
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati trilogy books that claim George Washington was actually replaced</v>

341
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>by a member of the Illuminati.</v>

342
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.240
<v Speaker 1>They claim that this imposter actually ran the United States.</v>

343
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.700
<v Speaker 1>People even suggest that the ion,</v>

344
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the American $1 bill is an indication of Illuminati interference and American</v>

345
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 1>governments why stops and the Illuminati are also used in video games and comic</v>

346
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:52.460
<v Speaker 1>books and even rap songs.</v>

347
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.150
<v Speaker 1>There are regular feature on history channel shows and mysterious shows about</v>

348
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies from all around the world.</v>

349
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Speaker 1>When major events happen,</v>

350
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 1>think that JFK assassination and nine slash 11,</v>

351
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>the Illuminati name still gets tossed around as a possible course and there's</v>

352
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:10.630
<v Speaker 1>even a theory that the modern day Illuminati and now headquartered in Bavaria or</v>

353
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:11.464
<v Speaker 1>where it was founded,</v>

354
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.120
<v Speaker 1>but right in the heart of the United States.</v>

355
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I was in Washington DC,</v>

356
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 1>not in New York,</v>

357
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>not in Los Angeles,</v>

358
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but in Denver,</v>

359
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>hidden beneath the airport and the Colorado city is said to be the headquarters</v>

360
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:27.020
<v Speaker 1>for the modern day incarnation of the most powerful secret society in the world.</v>

361
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything from the airports,</v>

362
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 1>runway design to its underground tunnels have been pointed to as evidence for</v>

363
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 1>why it's a perfect site for the societies operation.</v>

364
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.080
<v Speaker 1>It seems that 250 years after we first launched his idea for a secret society is</v>

365
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 1>influenced,</v>

366
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.270
<v Speaker 1>is still felt from pop culture to events of historic magnitude.</v>

367
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 1>The illuminati is still a factor,</v>

368
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of people bringing up their name.</v>

369
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.451
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

370
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it might not be exactly what he was planning or maybe it was,</v>

371
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.310
<v Speaker 1>do we really know how a secret society operates and has influence,</v>

372
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean by south did plan for the Illuminati to operate in the backgrounds after</v>

373
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:06.410
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
