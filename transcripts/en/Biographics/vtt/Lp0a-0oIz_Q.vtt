6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.520
Leon Trotsky was a man of thought and action.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.900
His dream of a Utopian society built on Marxism.
It crumbles around him,

8
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.410
yet he never gave up on his ideals when he was sidelines by the power hungry

9
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:29.161
Joseph Stalin,

10
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:33.660
he wielded his pen to expose the desk spot to the world knowing full well that

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.690
didn't doing so he was signing his own death warrants.
In today's biographics,

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.010
we discover the man who was Leon Trotsky.

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.950
<v 0>The man who is known to history as Leon Trotsky was born at Lev Davidovich</v>

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.920
Bronstein on November the seventh 1879 his parents,

16
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.340
David and Anna were farmers in the Ukrainian village of young covert.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.970
David has built himself up from nothing to become one of the most successful

18
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:03.380
farmers in the entire region.

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.980
Lev was the fifth child born to the bronze deans during his first eight years.

20
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:09.710
He was kept on the farm and instructed by his parents.

21
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.950
The language they spoke was a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian.

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.940
Then at the age of eight,

23
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:17.720
he was sent to a private Ukrainian Jewish school in Adesa and Ukraine.

24
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.960
Let's struggled during his first year at school is he was not familiar with the

25
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:24.050
vernacular riff Jewish Yiddish that were spoken in time.

26
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.440
Though he improved and he proved himself to be a very capable students.

27
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.340
You quickly learn to speak Russian and he fell in love with Russian literature.

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.810
After two years at the private school,

29
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:37.580
Lev was transferred to a state run Russian school.
As in Paul's High School,

30
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.010
he excelled to beat one of the top students.
However,

31
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.900
he proved to be an independent thinker,

32
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.050
which sometimes led to run ins with his teachers.

33
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.280
His reading of such intellectual giants like Leo Tolstoy gave him the knowledge

34
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:53.210
to challenge things that the other students except it about the order of society

35
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.180
which caused frustration for his long suffering.

36
00:01:56.181 --> 00:02:00.320
Instructors graduating from school at the age of 17 left moved to the Ukrainian

37
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.720
port town of Nikolai of close to the black seat.

38
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.320
He lived with two relatives while he decided what he wanted to do with his life.

39
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.090
Nikolai of at that time was a sensor of revolutionary descends and the teenagers

40
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:13.910
lab as soon began to mingle with the radical crowd

41
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.580
within a few months of arriving in Nikolayev Love Matt,

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.540
a young woman by the name of Alexandria Sokolov Skype.

43
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.370
She was six years older than Levins,

44
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.160
well versed and revolutionary leftist politics.

45
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.820
Lovely to record that he was attracted to Alexandra because she was the only

46
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.240
person who was able to defeat him in a debate.
The subject is history.

47
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.900
It was Marxism and whether it would be the best thing for Russian society.

48
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.110
They've argued against it,

49
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.450
but every arguments that he made was definitely destroyed by the wit and the

50
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:49.810
wisdom of Alexandra Levy found himself falling in love with her,

51
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.530
but hardly before the relationship could get established.
He was thrown in jail.

52
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.430
The course of his imprisonments in January of 1898 was this involvement in a

53
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:00.850
demonstration of striking members over the next two years.

54
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.810
He was a regularly thrown in jail for short spells as a result of his

55
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.560
involvement in public demonstrations in 1,911 Alexandra,

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.450
they were married shortly after the wedding.

57
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.650
Alexandra was banished to Simon area for four years as a result of our own

58
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.220
radical activities.
And your husband though he went right along with that.

59
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.820
They ended up in these Siberian village of [inaudible] over the next two years.

60
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.490
They eat out are living in this cold and harsh terrain.

61
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.270
The couple of ones who had two children,
girls named.
So Neda and Nina.

62
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.280
After two years of this exile,

63
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.640
live fat already had enough and he was ready to make his escape by now.

64
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:35.710
His wife had fully converted him to Marxism,

65
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.220
communism and he was determined to get out of this purgatory and it's become

66
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.950
active in the revolutionary cause.
It was a result of that.

67
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.400
Alexandra would remain in so area with the two young children.

68
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.600
Let's travel to the [inaudible] region of Siberia.
There.

69
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.340
He got a hold of a stolen passport.

70
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.650
It was then that he assumed his new name scribbling.

71
00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.740
It's on the pages of the fake passports.
Leon Trotsky.

72
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.010
He made his way to London and you get to learn at the feet of the founder of

73
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:08.640
Russian Marxism,
Vladimir Lenin.
The two men developed an immediate bonds.

74
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.140
Lenin Trotsky on as his apprentice setting him to work as a writer for his

75
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.470
Communist newspaper is scrap within a couple of months of his arrival.

76
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.260
Then in sent him out on a fundraising and publicity tour of Europe.

77
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:22.860
Do you promote the newspaper as well as the communist cause all the Paris leg of

78
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:25.550
the tour,
he met a young woman by the name of Natalia Sedova.

79
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.910
Despite still being married to Alexandra at PN,
Natalia soon became mounted wife.

80
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.180
She returned with him to London and they sat up.
How's that?

81
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.680
Not long after his return from Europe,

82
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:38.310
Trotsky attended the second congress of the Democratic Workers Party in London.

83
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.970
The main topic of discussion was the recent splits in the Russian Communist

84
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.080
Party between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks,
the Mensheviks.
Well,

85
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.590
the more moderate of the two factions who envisions a gradual transition to

86
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.320
communism,
the Bolsheviks,
however,
they were far more radical.

87
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.280
They intend to do this man's or the current system immediately and replace it

88
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.990
with full on communism.

89
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.890
They were fully prepared to stage violence uprising in order to achieve that

90
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:06.060
means the names of these factions.
They tell us about their levels of support.

91
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.640
The Menshevik means man of the minority.
You're,

92
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.760
while Bolsheviks translates to men of the majority,

93
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.310
nothing was in favor of the Bolsheviks or the camera is amazing.

94
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:17.910
He explained the Bolsheviks needed to create a centralized power structure from

95
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.270
which they could control and direct the common people.
This idea,

96
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.440
it was very troubling to Trotsky who saw it as a replacement of the type of

97
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:29.190
capitalist control of the masses that they were trying to get rid of for many

98
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.001
years after that.

99
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:34.050
As he continued to try and bridge the divide between the Bolsheviks and the

100
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:34.884
Mensheviks

101
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.210
in 1905 Russia at suffered a humiliating defeat against the Japanese in the

102
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.380
battle of true Shima.

103
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.640
They'd left the Russian economy in ruins and has led to mass demonstrations on

104
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:55.110
January the 22nd 1905 the peaceful demonstration gathered outside of San Nicolas

105
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:58.520
is winter palace.
Nicholas reacted sending in the cavalry.

106
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.880
The demonstrators were routed with hundreds being killed in the street.

107
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.850
The people,
they were outraged and the Bolshevik ranks.
However,

108
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.560
celebrations began to occur.

109
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.150
They saw this as the spark that would bring on the great communist revolution

110
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.520
over the following months.
Protest screwed larger,

111
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:18.020
morphing into the general strike of October,
1905 over that period of time,

112
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.630
the Bolsheviks,
they were busy organizing the resistance.

113
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.600
Both of Lenin and Trotsky had relocated to some peaches back.

114
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.910
Trotsky began organizing special work as assemblies.

115
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.630
These groups were designed to take control of regions that were to be governed

116
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:33.800
by a workers council.
The Russian word for council will that'd be Soviets.

117
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.060
Trotsky set up the first Soviet and some Peter's bag with him serving as its

118
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.580
chairman in short order.
The region was surrounded by the Siris Armenians.

119
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.310
Trotsky was taken into captivity.

120
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.300
He was held in prison for nearly a year before being put on trial.

121
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.580
Defending the charge of leading the armed rebellion.

122
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.150
Trotsky gave an impressive speech in which he laid out all the benefits of

123
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.250
Marxism.
All of this was in vain.
However,

124
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:59.210
as he was convicted and he was exiled once again to Siberia,

125
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.490
Trump's get determined that there was no way that he was going back to that

126
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:10.690
Siberian wilderness.

127
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.700
In January of 1907 he escaped while being transported to his place of

128
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:19.750
banishments for a second time.
He headed off to London.
Within weeks,
though,

129
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.270
he had relocated to Vienna in Austria.

130
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.600
It was there that he started working for the communist propaganda newspaper.

131
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.310
Pravda financing.
The ongoing publication of Pravda was a constant challenge.

132
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.540
In 1909 Trotsky requested that the Bolshevik central committee inject funds to

133
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:38.020
keep the paper going.
Lennon now with the head of the Bolsheviks agreed,

134
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:42.370
but only on the condition that a Bolshevik be put in place as assistant editor.

135
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.940
There's men's that the moderate views which Trotsky had managed to infuse into

136
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:49.870
the paper,
we're no longer going to be acceptable.
From 1910 onwards,

137
00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:52.780
provder became the mouthpiece of Bolshevik communism.

138
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.090
Tensions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.

139
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:56.560
They continued to cause division.

140
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.460
In 1912 Lennon instigated a purge to remove the moderate voices.

141
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.880
Trotsky remains in opposition to the more radical actions of the Bolsheviks such

142
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:06.610
as armed robberies of banks to finance the party.

143
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.720
He organized a unification conference to bring the factions together,

144
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:11.800
but it was a failure.

145
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.793
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

146
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.340
<v 0>is around 1912 Trotsky wrote for a number of radical Russian and Ukrainian</v>

147
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:23.080
newspapers.
In September of that year,

148
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:26.960
he was sent on assignment to cover the Balkan war.
When World War One breakouts,

149
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.150
he moved from Australia to Switzerland and then to Paris.
From his base there,

150
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:35.410
he wrote antiwar diatribes in which witchy describes the injustice of the

151
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:39.130
workers of the world who were being forced to kill each other at the beckoning

152
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:40.820
of their rulers,
the French government.

153
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:44.560
They were not impressed with this anti war stance since they're Trotsky
deported.

154
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.640
On March 31st,
1916 Trotsky,
he went to Spain.

155
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:52.720
Bird says writing said to deportation from that country as well.

156
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.970
He ultimately ended up in the United States.

157
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.710
They arrived in New York on January the 13th 1917 he says,

158
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.550
old into a small room and the Bronx and began writing for several Russian

159
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.270
newspapers.

160
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.240
And month after his arrival in the u s Trotsky received the news that saw

161
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:07.710
Nicholas had been overthrown.

162
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.300
He designed it to return in order to do play his part in the history that was

163
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:17.280
unfolding.
On march the 27th of 1917 Trotsky sailed from New York harbor on bold,

164
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.770
the s s Christiana fought.
However,

165
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:23.530
the ship was intercepted by the British Navy at Halifax,
Nova Scotia,
and Trotsky.

166
00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:26.880
It was held in an internment camp for a month through the intervention of the

167
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.960
Russian foreign minister.

168
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.750
He was released and he was able to continue on to Russia.

169
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.080
Now just before we get into the very important October Revolution,

170
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.680
I do want to tell you a bit about brilliant,
brilliant,
uh,

171
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.140
signs of lending platform that allow you to learn through active learning.

172
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:41.400
Basically some dump.

173
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:45.210
This is the opposite of that feeling where you read a really complex paragraph

174
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:49.740
about some principle and then you've just got no clue what on earth is going on.

175
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:54.420
Even if you've read it through 10 times,
you still like,
Huh,
anyway,
and brilliant.

176
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.360
Don't just teach you the basics,
so they do cover that as well.

177
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.810
They go all the way to complex things like differential equations,

178
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.180
but you've heard me talk a bunch of our brilliant previously.

179
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:04.380
If you're a regular viewer,

180
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.440
I think that a perfect fit for this channel because hey,

181
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:10.740
you're probably ends are learning and education because you're on youtube and

182
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:14.430
you watching as a 20 minute educational video,
so you're into learning.

183
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.400
You're into this channel.
You'll probably be into brilliant too recently.

184
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:17.761
Brilliant.

185
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:21.330
Made an important update to their mobile apps so that now causes can be accessed

186
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.810
offline so you didn't have to worry about having a solid internet connections.

187
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:26.610
You learn things through that platform.

188
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.690
Maybe this means you can spend your commute learning something or indeed you can

189
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.960
learn something wherever you want.
Brilliant.
Makes even complex concepts.

190
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.570
Easy to understand is they give you something super short to read,

191
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:37.530
it's really easy,

192
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.520
and then you immediately apply it to a problem or rinse and repeat and suddenly

193
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.700
you're understanding all sorts of stuff that you didn't think you'd ever get.

194
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.380
Full courses are totally interactive,

195
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:50.760
so you can learn probability by playing blackjack or you can learn the physics

196
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:54.360
of motion using interactive models of pendulum clocks.

197
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.380
So if you want to support biographics,

198
00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.960
which would be awesome and get unlimited access to all of brilliance in depth

199
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.700
math and science courses,

200
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.080
you can head over to brilliant.org forward slash biographics and get 20% off the

201
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:11.340
annual premium subscription.
And let's get back to Trotsky and his revolution.

202
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.320
Following the ousting of San Nicolas,

203
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:22.800
it's supposedly neutral provisional government was put into place until a more

204
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.480
permanent government could be established.

205
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.460
Trotsky arrived in St Petersburg on May the 17th 1917 he soon became a popular

206
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.630
speaker at town halls and factories as the various political elements vying for

207
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:38.160
power.
His catch phrase embodied the three tenants of his revolution,
revision,

208
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.280
distrust the bourgeoisie,
control our own leaders,

209
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.330
and to have confidence in our revolutionary forces.
The Bolsheviks,

210
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:49.350
they struggled for more radical changes than the state government or doom or

211
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:52.050
envisions.
Trotsky aligned himself with the Bolsheviks.

212
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.660
He was arrested on August the seventh for his involvement in a Bolshevik

213
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:56.291
demonstration.

214
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:59.860
They spent 40 days in prison is probably used to that at this point.

215
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.160
On October the eighth with the Bolsheviks support gaining ascendancy,

216
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.180
Trotsky was voted governor of the Sun Petersburg Soviets for a second time.

217
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.120
By the end of the year,
the provisional government's,
it had failed.

218
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.630
It was superseded by the Bolsheviks with Lennon of that hat.

219
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.630
The second most powerful man,
all that was Leon Trotsky

220
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.910
and immediate focus for the Bolshevik government was to get Russia out of the

221
00:12:26.911 --> 00:12:27.390
war.

222
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.200
This task was handed to Trotsky along with the title of People's Commissar for

223
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:32.040
foreign affairs.

224
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.360
On December the second 1917 the Bolsheviks signed to cease fire with the allied

225
00:12:36.361 --> 00:12:38.760
central powers,
Germany,
Austria,
Hungary,

226
00:12:38.761 --> 00:12:43.050
and tocky talks then began between Trotsky and the central power delegates to

227
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.290
work out and armistice agreement.
The Germans in particular,

228
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:47.550
they drove a hard bargain.

229
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.790
They demanded that the Russians give up their claim to Ukraine,
Poland,

230
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.360
Lithuania as well as parts of Latvia and Bella Russia.

231
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.780
Trotsky was taken aback by the demands,

232
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.950
but he also knew that he had little choice.

233
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.460
The Bolsheviks had campaigns on a platform of getting Russia out of the war and

234
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.610
all of Russia was essentially demanding vast Trotsky.

235
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.740
He related the demands to Len and adding this.

236
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.370
He felt they had no choice but to agree that he was at the same opinion,

237
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.040
but when the rest of the Bolshevik governments had the demands,

238
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.240
they were infuriated.

239
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.500
They managed to convince both Trotsky and Lenin not to sign the armistice.

240
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.700
In the end is Trotsky simply decided to pull out of the hostilities without the

241
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:27.570
benefit of anonymous disagreements.
He explains,
we declare we ends the war,

242
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:28.950
but will not sign a piece.

243
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.010
They will be unable to make an offensive against us if they attack us.

244
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:34.140
All position will be no worse than now.

245
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.240
It was a gamble that Trotsky would immediately regret it.

246
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.250
On February the 18th or 19th 18 Austrian and German forces,
they invaded Russia.

247
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.970
They found the borders compete be on defendant.
On hearing the news,
Trotsky,

248
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.330
he was dumbfounded.
He sent a message to the German ambassador stating,

249
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.120
we request clarification of this misunderstanding,

250
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.460
but there was no misunderstanding.
The very next day,

251
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:55.650
Trotsky was commanded by Lenin to,

252
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.860
except of the original German conditions for the armistice.
Yeah.

253
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.653
<v 4>Okay.</v>

254
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.590
<v 0>With Russia now,
out of the wall,</v>

255
00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:10.130
Trotsky was made commander in chief of the armed forces.

256
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.880
A crisis occurred when the Czech Slovak legions returning from the war revolted

257
00:14:13.881 --> 00:14:15.050
against the Bolshevik governments.

258
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.620
The resistance grew into what became known as the White Army.

259
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.530
When he heard that the outpost of Cazan had fallen to this opposition,

260
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:25.400
Trotsky hopped on a train and headed for the area to assess the situation for

261
00:14:25.401 --> 00:14:25.950
himself.

262
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.940
Has trained only made it part of the way before he was forced to turn back,

263
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.380
but before they could get out of town,

264
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.370
the white army forces that surrounded Trotsky's contingent for 25 days.

265
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:37.640
They were forced to fend off the assault until they were finally able to break

266
00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:40.370
out and returned to some peaches bag with the white army,

267
00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:41.480
challenging them from the east.

268
00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:44.120
The Bolsheviks also faced pressure from the north.

269
00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:47.390
There's a finished group known as the white guard sought to rescued,

270
00:14:47.391 --> 00:14:50.270
saw Nicholas and his family from captivity.
The group,

271
00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:52.940
we're on the verge of control of the town of Yak Taryn bag,

272
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:55.310
which is where they're all family were being held captive.

273
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.750
Then the order came through to kill the entire royal family with this terrible

274
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:03.440
deed done.
The Bolsheviks were ousted from the town.
However,
the white guards,

275
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.740
they were simply too late to save Nicholas or his family.

276
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.330
At the beginning of 1919 Russia,
it was in a state of crisis.
Civil wars.

277
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.150
It racked to the country hands now disease,
famine,

278
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.760
and poverty decimated the population.
Meanwhile,

279
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:21.410
European powers hovered around like vultures ready to devour the Russian corpse.

280
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.101
By October,

281
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:25.850
the white army has almost total control into a pressing at the gates of some

282
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:29.270
peaches bag.
The Soviet government ordered a full scale retreat from the capitol.

283
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:31.370
This Trotsky,
he strongly disagreed.

284
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.900
He rallied his supporters to resist to the very last man Trotsky's bravery,

285
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.480
persistence,
and strong personality turns the tide.

286
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.200
The Soviet forces dug in and managed to push back the why Tommy,

287
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.220
some Petersburg was safe and it's the tide of the civil war.

288
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:47.750
It began to change in favor of the Bolsheviks.

289
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.620
By the end of 1920 the white Tommy had been concentrated in Siberia.

290
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.670
The Soviets had survived.
You see off their enemies and cement that leadership.

291
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.330
However,
in May of 1922 that leader and visionary Vladimir Lenin,

292
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.620
he had a massive stroke.

293
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.440
Trotsky would have seemed to have been the natural successor.
However,

294
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.010
there was another member of the Bolshevik power structure who had other ideas

295
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.520
and his name,
of course,
with Joseph Stalin.

296
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.480
Joseph Stalin was a street fighter and a thug.

297
00:16:19.481 --> 00:16:22.600
It would cajoled is Wayne's becoming the general secretary of the Soviet Union.

298
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:24.370
By the time that Lennon died,

299
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.270
the position it didn't hold any real power with all of his actions being

300
00:16:28.271 --> 00:16:31.120
controlled by the executive committee or the PELLISSIPPI row.

301
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.540
By the end of 1922 Lennon had recovered sufficiently to send a note to the

302
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:37.000
political bureau giving us thoughts on his successor.

303
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.540
He stated the Trotsky was a stronger personality than stolen bus,

304
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.350
that he was too prone to acting unilaterally without consulting the rest of the

305
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:48.610
council.
As for Stalin,
he considered him to be too rude,
too ruthless,

306
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.780
and to intolerance.

307
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.040
Lenin held on until January the 21st 1924 during that time,

308
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:57.370
it became clear to style and that the dying leader favored Trotsky over him.

309
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.420
This is him to embark on a ruthless campaign to discredit Trotsky.

310
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.960
He claimed that Trotsky was trying to cause divisions within the party by trying

311
00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:08.200
to push down to the old guards in favor of younger members who were more

312
00:17:08.201 --> 00:17:10.000
inclined to its will stolen.

313
00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:14.200
Managed to have a book that Trotsky had written in 1923 bands from sale as being

314
00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.440
anti Leninist,
even though it was nothing of the sort.

315
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.680
The open and constant criticisms of Trotsky resulted in the loss of his do

316
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:26.681
officers is chairman of the war council and People's Commissar of war and navy.

317
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.590
After spending almost all of 1925 without a job,

318
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:33.130
Trotsky was recorded in 1926 and given three roles.
However,

319
00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:37.180
it stolen interfered so much that he resigned from two of them only retaining

320
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:40.150
the position of chairman of the concessions committee,

321
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.590
but Stalin was not through with Trotsky yet.
I'll,

322
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:53.730
November the 12th 1927 he had been expelled from the Communist Party and then

323
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.310
Exxon to Kazakhstan.
Three months later,

324
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.940
he was completely bands from living in the Soviet Union,
Soviet gods.

325
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:03.210
They forced him onto a train and would not tell him where he was going.

326
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.650
After going on a hunger strike,

327
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:07.470
he was finally informed that he was headed for Turkey.

328
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.520
This enraged Trotsky who is convinced that the anticommunist regime there,

329
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:13.380
which have him executed immediately,

330
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.500
he sends a message to the central committee requesting a change of heart,

331
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.410
but there was no response.
There's surprisingly the tax.

332
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:23.310
They treated Trotsky with the greatest respect he was given a home to live in

333
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.610
with his wife and his Holly errands.
There's some lev from his new base.

334
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:30.360
He began writing about the situation within the Soviet Union and specifically

335
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:31.560
the failings of Stalin.

336
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.410
He didn't hold back riding the following in an article titled,

337
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:37.740
What is stolen is political.
Horizon is extremely narrow.

338
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:42.330
He has the mentality of a dog and empiricist devoid of creative imagination.

339
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.680
These writings were published in newspapers around the world knowing what we do

340
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:48.400
now about Stalin's personality.

341
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.270
It is a wonder that he didn't have Trotsky killed immediately,

342
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.260
but to have done so would have been to bring the condemnation of the world down

343
00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:59.610
on stolen.
As a result,
he sought to shut him up by sending him deeper into exile.

344
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.660
The tax received orders to remove Trotsky to the island of PrinCap buyer.

345
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.990
After a year there,
he managed to get political asylum in France.

346
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.300
The French would not allow Trotsky to live in Paris,

347
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:13.080
so he settled in the coastal community of Rome.
He spends almost two years that,

348
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:16.440
but then French Soviet relations improved and the government was pressured to

349
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:19.870
deport him for a year.
He stayed in Norway with journalist Conrad can loosen.

350
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.930
While that he wrote the revolution betrayed,

351
00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:25.640
which further highlighted the failings of Joseph Stalin a furious and pressured

352
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.070
the Norwegian governments and Trotsky was once again deported.

353
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.300
He and his wife and son,

354
00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:34.260
they now had did for Trotsky's final destination of Mexico for just over two

355
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:38.640
years.
From January,
1937 to April of 1939 they lived with artists,

356
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:41.340
Diego Riviera Rent Frida Kahlo.
During that time,

357
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:45.030
and Trotsky had an affair with Freider even though his wife and son were also

358
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.260
living under the same roof.

359
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.430
In April of 1939 the Trotsky's moved into their own home a few streets away from

360
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.780
Diego and Frieda.
It was here that he wrote his strongest attack on stolen.
Yet.

361
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.780
The article was titled Hitler and Stalin in it's,

362
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.680
he wrote about Stalin's hypocrisy and signing a nonaggression pact with Hitler.

363
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.780
It stages over the last three years,

364
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.680
Starlin is labeled every one of Lennon's comrades in arms agents of Hitler

365
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.910
having destroyed the army posse and decapitated the army stolen and is now

366
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.720
openly advancing his candidature as hipness chief agents.

367
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.960
Bye now.
Trotsky was convinced that Stalin would soon to silence him.

368
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.370
On February the 27th of 1940 he wrote Trotsky's testaments in which he defended

369
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:30.900
himself as a loyal party member.

370
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.920
In the mid 1940s Trotsky's house was swarmed by members of the Russian secret

371
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:38.400
police,
the and KVD Trotsky's.
God's managed to fight them off.

372
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:41.790
They following the failed assassination attempt to Trotsky wrote an article

373
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:46.260
titled at Stalin's seeks my death on June the eighth 1940 in which he stated

374
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:49.210
that another assassination was absolutely certain.

375
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.930
A month later on August the 20th of 1940 a man walked into Trotsky study and

376
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.820
buried in ice pick into his head drops.
Ski Did not die immediately.

377
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:01.900
They rather p fought the attacker until his body guards were able to come in and

378
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:05.570
subdue him.
Trotsky was rushed to the local hospital.
According to James Buchanan,

379
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.470
the secretary of the Socialist Workers Party in the USA.

380
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.010
Trotsky's last words were,
I will not survive this attack.

381
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:17.070
Starlin has finally accomplished the task he attempted on successfully before he

382
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:18.370
died the next day.

383
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.580
