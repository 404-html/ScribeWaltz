00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
Alexander the Great's stood at the head of the world's most feared army using it

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.440
to conference self and absolutely vast empire.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
He crushed the Persian empire and then thrust his way into Egypt and India to

11
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.110
become the acknowledged king of kings spend at the height of his power,

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.460
he was cut down leaving behind a legacy of heroism,

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.800
divinity,
tyranny,
and today's biographics.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.240
We examined the incredible life of Alexander

15
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.850
the future.
Alexander the great who was born in Pella,
Macedonia,

16
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:05.710
the capital of ancient Greece,

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.260
because the Greeks used a different calendar than we do.

18
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:11.890
We can't actually say for 70 when exactly he was born.

19
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.810
Most historians believe that he was born on July the 20th 356 BCE.

20
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.470
He was the son of the king of Mastodon Phillip,
the seconds and the principal,

21
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:24.790
one of his seven wives Olympia's of apparatus as the son of the King Alexander,

22
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.140
he was raised by a nurse,

23
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.020
had private tutors with the first one being a relative by the name of Liana
does.

24
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.120
This man was a strict teacher who demanded a high level of academic rigor of the

25
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:37.690
young prince.
Liana does Alexandra in such subjects as maths,

26
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:40.720
reading and languages at around the age of seven I think it all just started

27
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.910
instruction under one of his father's generals,

28
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:46.280
a man by the name of the Leisa mcass of Archimania,

29
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.120
his drawl boys to teach the boy to behave like a noble.

30
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.080
Alexander was taught to play the liar as well as to ride and to hunt.
Bison.

31
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.710
Marcus also gave them instruction in fighting.
When he was 10 years old,

32
00:01:56.711 --> 00:02:00.370
Alexander's father was presented with a horse for sale by a trader,

33
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.241
but the horse,

34
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:05.170
it was wild and no one could mount it for NYP was about to dismiss this

35
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:05.500
straighter.

36
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.700
When y'all Alexander stepped forward and said that he was able to team the

37
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.900
animal.
The boys set himself,
so breaking the animal,
Lynn's becoming it's monster.

38
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.210
This was a dangerous task even for a grown man,

39
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.530
but young Alexander showed impressive determination and perseverance to conquer

40
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.270
this horse.
His father,

41
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:26.800
the king was so proud of his son that he even gave way to tears.
He told his son,

42
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.180
my buy,
you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions.

43
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.040
Mastodon is too small for you.
After saying this,
he purchased the horse for him.

44
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.100
He named the horse view syphilis,
which means ox set.

45
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.430
He rode the horse over most of his career and he carried it with him and too

46
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:45.970
many battles.
When we sat,
Willis died of old age at 30 Alexander,

47
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.510
you named just city off to him when he was 13 Alexander is education.

48
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:50.710
It was taken to a new level.

49
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.440
When Phillip employed the greatest philosopher of the day,

50
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.360
Aristotle to tutor his son.

51
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.390
The daily lessons were held at the temple of Nymphs of Mesa.

52
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.170
Alexander's lived there with other royal children and a sort of very privileged

53
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:03.250
version of a boarding school.

54
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.090
Some of the teenagers that Alexandra associated with at that time would later

55
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.320
become his generals.
Aristotle provided instruction in religion,
morals,

56
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.460
philosophy,
art,

57
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.120
and there's logic in appreciation for the education that he was providing for

58
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.320
his son.
The King Rebuilt Aristotle's home in the town of staggy wrap.

59
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.780
This said previously been destroyed by the same king.

60
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.200
He also purchased every save in the town and freed them.

61
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.200
When he reached the age of 16 Alexander was handed a huge responsibility.

62
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.100
His father had just declared war on Byzantium and he was a bouncer lead his army

63
00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:40.850
into battle.

64
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.910
He left the Capitol City of Macedonia under the control of Alexander.

65
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.430
It was a huge display of trust on behalf of the king.

66
00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:48.140
This others soon took advantage.

67
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.220
A group of European tribes known as the three C and made he rose up in rebellion

68
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:55.400
under the impression that the kingdom was weakened under the teenage prince.

69
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.680
But Alexander,
he was up to the challenge.

70
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.950
He sent his army in and the three seasons were quickly driven out of their

71
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:05.840
territory.
Yeah,
the area repopulated with Griggs and renamed it Alexandropolis.

72
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.370
When King Philip returned from battle,

73
00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:10.440
he was extremely impressed with the way that his son had dealt with the three C

74
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:14.060
in revolt.
He gave Alexander his own small army and did the drop of stomping out.

75
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.910
Any minor revolves that crops up throughout the empire.

76
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.580
Over the next three years,
Alexander,

77
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:22.010
he joined his father on a number of military campaigns to dominate the Greek

78
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:22.550
states.

79
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.300
On one occasion it was claims there's Alexander saved his father's life during a

80
00:04:26.301 --> 00:04:28.940
campaign against the Greek state of parenthesis.

81
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.390
They defeated the cities of a [inaudible] and um,

82
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.450
up then they come up against the of the armies of Athens and Thebes.

83
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.040
They always measuring an epic battle.

84
00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:40.610
Nick irony and Biasha Phillips took the right wing of the army and put the left

85
00:04:40.611 --> 00:04:44.240
wing under Alexander with Macedonia as top generals having to answer to him the

86
00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:47.840
Thebes Thebesians Athenians defeated giving Philip control of the majority of

87
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:52.130
the Greek states.
He then said about you're noting them into a Hellenic alliance,

88
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.580
having stamped his dominance on a largely United Greece.

89
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.090
Phillip set his sights on conquering Persia this time he'd left his son in

90
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:07.960
control of a hugely extended empire.
When he returns,

91
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.380
Phillip added an extra wife to his household.
Her name was Cleopatra.

92
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.243
You read a scene.

93
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.530
This marriage put Alexander's position is that of the throne in danger?

94
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.600
Cleopatra?
It was a full Macedonian.
Well,

95
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.740
Alexander was only half Macedonian this man's that.
If Cleopatra had a son,

96
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:25.490
this one would supersede Alexander in the line of succession during the wedding

97
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.450
feast at a loss,

98
00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:30.300
the uncle of Cleopatra who was one of Phillip's top generals was heard to drunk

99
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:34.280
and the requests of the gods that looking and his new bride should quickly

100
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.330
produce a son.
Alexander heard the plea and it was not happy.

101
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.630
He went up to the general and threw a cup in his head and said,
you villain.

102
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.400
What am I?
Then a bastard,

103
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.150
Alexander felt abandoned by his father after the wedding in his mother left

104
00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:49.640
Mastodon and headed for apres where a mother's brother,

105
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:52.010
King Alexander the first presided leaving his mother there.

106
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:55.760
He continued on to Elyria in the western part of the Balkan peninsula.

107
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.960
He was welcomed as a dignitary by the Hillary and king back in Macedonia,

108
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.300
but king was saddened by his sons departure.

109
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.200
He sent a messenger to persuade addicts to reten they're islands.

110
00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:08.990
He was that Philip had never intended to displace Alexandre a Zap.
However,

111
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.060
shortly after Alexander's returned to Mastodon,

112
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:12.950
there was more tension between the two.

113
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.770
Phillip arranged for Alexander's younger brother were also called fit up to Mary

114
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.800
Alexander.

115
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.240
Alexander's trouble making friends persuaded him that the king was again trying

116
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.580
to constantly call from inheriting the throne.
However,

117
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.730
when for the poet of the room as he angrily banished the troublemakers

118
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.740
in October of 336 BC,

119
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.850
the Macedonian Royal Court was in ag for the wedding of Alexander,

120
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:40.370
the first of us and Alexander's sister,
Cleopatra of Macedonia.

121
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.880
Phillip was assassinated by one of his bodyguards as he entered into the towns

122
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.440
theater.
The reasons for the assassination around clear,

123
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.080
but the results was very clear.
20 year olds,
Alexander was now king of Macedonia.

124
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.390
Alexander was shaken by his father's murder.

125
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.990
He knew that the plotters were intent on stealing the thrown out from under him.

126
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.200
If he didn't take decisive action,
he too would she be debt?

127
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.580
He began by having his cousin.

128
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:04.900
I meant just the fourth put to death along with a pair of Macedonian princes

129
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.030
from [inaudible].
He also ordered the execution of atlas,

130
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.010
the uncle of his step mother,
Cleopatra,
his mother Olympia's.

131
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.830
So danger in the form of Cleopatra.

132
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.230
The women who had married Philip a few years earlier.

133
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.680
She had arranged for Cleopatra runs the daughter she had had with Philip to be

134
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:19.250
killed.

135
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.790
She also poisoned others and even some of the mentally and physically disabled

136
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:24.950
for life.
Alexander was furious.

137
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.190
It his mother poisoning his half sister who he didn't consider it to be a threat

138
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:31.940
to him when the news that the stable dominant rule of Philip had been replaced

139
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:33.230
by his 20 year old son,

140
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.860
a number of states where in Boldens do rise up in revolts.
Recently,

141
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:37.431
concrete states,

142
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:41.450
including Athens and fessel Omika attempted to reassign it to their
independence.

143
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.700
Despite his advice edging a diplomatic response,

144
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.270
Alexander was determined to stamp his dominance on the rebellious states.

145
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.890
He personally led a force of 3000 soldiers to sort things out.
In many cases,

146
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:55.790
the uncooperative states resistance evaporated at the site of Alexandra at the

147
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.270
head of his army.
Those who didn't sweat put down very swiftly.

148
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.350
He rode through the various states that his father had,
United and Xander.

149
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.790
He was heaped with praise.

150
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.900
His swift action had cemented his power and it's provided a seamless transition

151
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:12.860
from his father's rule to his having put down a series of revolts.

152
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:15.980
Alexander at wants to do it and show that the way.
No further uprisings.

153
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.090
In his second year as king,

154
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:20.660
he took his own east and defeated the Tracy and people who had rebelled against

155
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:23.750
him four years ago.
He also conquered the Trib Aldi tribe.

156
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.940
By now Alexander's Macedonian Kingdom.

157
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.600
It didn't become so large that if he went north to put down a rebellion,

158
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:31.190
people in the south would rise up.

159
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.830
Then when he went south for those in the north would rebel again.

160
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.700
What was needed was a show of dominance that would prevent feather uprisings

161
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.360
within northern states,
brought them control.
Alexander took his armies south.

162
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.640
He went directly to thieves.
The only southern states,

163
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:47.390
which a dead to rebel Alexandre he was getting to make an example of them.

164
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.550
The city,
it was completely destroyed.

165
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.180
Even created a series of smaller cities that were populated with people from

166
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:54.890
other areas.
This assault,

167
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.550
it had finally brought all of Greece under Alexander's Dominion.
He now says,

168
00:08:58.551 --> 00:09:01.050
how have to conquer Asia to keep the home kingdom under control?

169
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.030
He bit a general by the name of Antipasto in charged with a size of alarmy army.

170
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.193
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

171
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.050
<v 0>In 334 BCE,
Alexander marched to 40,000 strong army out of Macedonia.</v>

172
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.370
He was focused on taking possession of the entire Persian empire,

173
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.340
which he considered to be a person or a gift to him from the gods.

174
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.181
Unlike his father,

175
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:27.870
Alexander was never really interested in achieving diplomatic negotiations.

176
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.830
He was all about taking what he wants it by force of arms.

177
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.490
The first resistance that the Macedonian army found as they swept into Persia

178
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.260
was it the battle of Granicus river?

179
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.220
This river was a formidable obstacle that the Greek army would have to cross the

180
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:42.960
Persians under the Memnon of roads,

181
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:45.990
position themselves around the river and we'll just do await the arrival of the

182
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.290
enemy.
Their strength was a little over half of that at the Greeks.

183
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.640
Alexander led his army into a direct frontal attack using a classic wedge shape

184
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:54.420
to salts.

185
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.450
They drove into the middle of the Persian line in the ballet that followed.

186
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.660
It was reported that Alexander personally killed several Persians.

187
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.610
He was almost filled with an ax player,

188
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:06.900
but he was able to recover and save himself the superior numbers of the Greeks

189
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:09.270
combined with their use of the lunch counter.

190
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:12.840
The javelin and attacks of the Persians eventually won the day.
The Persians,

191
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:14.880
they were defeated and chased from the field.

192
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.410
Social version casualties were around 4,000 with Alexander's army having lost a

193
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.160
10th of that number,
there had been about 18,000 Greek nurse and race.

194
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.850
He fought for the Persians in this battle.
They were captured by the Greek army.

195
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.750
I think Zonda considered these men to be traitors to their country and deserving

196
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.680
of no mercy.
He had half of them executed and the rest taken as slaves.

197
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.370
Following this victory,
Alexandra took possession of scientists,

198
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.630
the provincial capital of the Kingdom of video.

199
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.520
He then traveled down the Ionian coast.

200
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.060
Most towns welcomed him as a conqueror and Z.
Do you need to clouds that?

201
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.450
They were free of that Persian overlords and able to rule themselves.

202
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:50.730
There's a ton of mistakes.
As he moved down the coast,

203
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:54.570
the Persian navy was constantly trying to engage Alexander in battle.
However,

204
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.720
he resisted.
Preferring to fight on the lambs.
Moving south.

205
00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:01.890
Alexander came to Haluk analysis where he engaged in his first full scale CG

206
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:02.550
operation.

207
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.600
The Persian fleet is sales to the port of how to can asas where it's set up.

208
00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.760
A base.
Prior to Alexander's arrival,

209
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:12.300
the queen of how to kinesis eight or of carrier had been driven from the city

210
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:16.380
and replaced by a sash trap named or onto Beatty's eight or had set itself up in

211
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:19.950
the fortress of a Linda.
When Alexander wrote in,
she surrendered the fort to him,

212
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.250
the defenders of the city of how they can asses now set up to defend the city.

213
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.820
Still Alexon doesn't allow me a managed to break through the city walls,

214
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.730
how that they were driven back by the catapults from within the city,

215
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.450
a renewed assaults.
I became this parallel and stormed through a second time.

216
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.740
Memnon of Rhodes.

217
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:38.790
He was in defense of the city having evaded capture at Granicus river set the

218
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:41.970
city on fire before retreating the Persian fleets.

219
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.270
They also withdrew Alexander formally it return the city to queen eater.

220
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.400
In return.
She adopted him as a son,

221
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.000
that for making sure that the city would pass to him.
I'll have death,

222
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.580
so do you mind nobody be out.
Then it conquering the welds,

223
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.420
but if you want to conquer the Internet for yourself,

224

Squarespace and empowers dreamers,

227
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.020

228
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.960

00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:20.560
There's no fussing around is getting a domain from one place and bringing it

233
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:23.320
over to another.
Then working out how to sell something or whatever.

234
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.820
It's all just done neat and tidally on Squarespace.
That's pretty nice.

235

249
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.100
Let's get back to Alexander and his conquering of the world.

250
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.730
Control of helicon Asas and the coastal cities meant that the Persians could no

251
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:27.490
longer doc their fleet.
Continuing on his conquest,

252
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:30.220
Alexandra arrived did the Phrygian capitol of Gaudium.

253
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.880
There was here according to Greek legend that he was taken before rate famed

254
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.240
Oxcart,
which was tied with an incredibly complicated rope,

255
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:38.830
not known as the Gordian Knot.

256
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.920
It was whoever could undo the knot would become ruler of Asia.

257
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.060
Alexandra is said to have examined the knots closely then having no idea how to

258
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:50.470
undo it.
He pulled out his sword and to cut the ribbon half with a single stroke.

259
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.060
We don't know whether the story is true,
but you know it makes very good tale.

260
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.570
Continuing South Alexander's army and counsel for the first time a more

261
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.640
formidable army than his own.
It was under the leadership of Darious,

262
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.830
the third king of the Hakim and at empire of Persia does my being outnumbered,

263
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.520
Alexander's tactical skill and just personal bravery and leading from the front.

264
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.990
They won the day Darious.

265
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.740
He was completely overwhelmed by this loss he took to his heels before leaving

266
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:19.240
his army,
a great treasure and all of his kingdom.
Alexander claimed at all

267
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.180
with the absolute dominance of Alexander's Greek army over the Persians

268
00:14:29.181 --> 00:14:30.980
bordering nations began to panic.

269
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.120
The all conquering warrior king has developed an aura of invincibility and many

270
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:39.890
nations simply a seeded to him as he entered that territory by 332 he had taken

271
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.240
Syria and the coastal advance.
Then had about taking tire,

272
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:44.460
which was a coastal islands based,

273
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.820
sitting about a mile out in the Mediterranean Sea.

274
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.120
Conquering the islands would be a great challenge to Alexander with the

275
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.350
combination of sea and high walls that surrounded the islands and in with very

276
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:57.040
few options for seven months,
Alexander blockaded,

277
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.480
the island's preventing either entry or exit.

278
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.230
He then had his ami build a causeway out of rocks in order to allow them to get

279
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:06.170
to the city walls when the city walls well eventually breached.

280
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:09.830
Alexander was so angry with the extended Terry and holds out to this.

281
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.830
According to contemporary historian Arion of [inaudible] media,

282
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.420
he ordered the massacre of up to 8,000 citizens following the taking of ta.

283
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.140
Most of the cities on Alexander's campaign roots surrendered without putting up

284
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:21.974
any resistance.

285
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.180
They only one city that stood fum as he wound his way to Egypt was up as the

286
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.440
city centers top of a hill.

287
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:31.730
It looked as if Alexander was in for another protracted siege.
Yeah,

288
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.430
this was one siege that sort of look like an impossibility.

289
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.570
The walls were according to Alexander's engine is too high and too thick to be

290
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.660
penetrated.
For Alexander,
they,
this was just the soldiers of challenge.

291
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.040
As chiefs is flooding,
he became even more determined to conquer the city.

292
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.460
He was convinced that destiny was going to find a way for him.

293
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.460
The Greek call me mate three desperate attempts to breach the walls.

294
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.060
Eventually on the final day,
they made that breakthrough,
but the cost,

295
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.780
it was terrific with thousands of men folding to the missiles of the enemy.

296
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.800
Alexander himself suffered a serious shoulder wound.
Once the city was taken,

297
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:07.160
severe punishments was exacted upon the inhabitants with the men being

298
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:10.160
slaughtered in the women and children being sold into slavery.

299
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.730
When the will conquer in Greek army approached the holy Jewish city of
Jerusalem.

300
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:17.150
The Jews throw open the gates and welcomes admins that midst.

301
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.720
It was reported that Alexander was taken into the Great Temple of Solomon and

302
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:24.860
shown a prophetic text from the book of Daniel that referred to him as a mighty

303
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:26.570
king who would conquer the land.

304
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.950
I think it after recent and peace and headed south to they claim to Egypt.

305
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.110
In that land,
he was welcomed as a liberator.

306
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.770
The people were proclaimed him to be a son of the gods and gave him reverends on

307
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:40.130
the same level as though in Pharaoh he founded the city of Alexandria,

308
00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:42.980
which would become a major trading center in future times

309
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.000
leaving Egypt.

310
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.600
Alexander traveled back north as he set his sights on taken Babylon.

311
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.050
This is the Persian capitol where King Darious had positioned himself.

312
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.840
Alexander marched with 47,000 men,

313
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:02.510
but Darious had amassed a massive army,

314
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:05.990
which some historians have put at 1 million men.

315
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.800
The two armies met near the village of Greg Mella at the forefront of his lines.

316
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:14.240
Darious place chariots armed with sides and 15 elephants in another time to do

317
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.340
move through the Greek lines.
In response,

318
00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:19.790
Alexander placed his light to troops up front to negate the effects of the

319
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:22.370
chariots with missiles directed at their horses.

320
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.320
Those chariots that made it to the Greek line,

321
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:27.740
we're allowed to pass harmlessly through where they were surrounded and
captured.

322
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.440
Darious himself was in a sidearms chariots,

323
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:34.070
which when the idea was felled by a javelin,
he jumped from the chariot,

324
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.700
mounted a horse and flat seeing this many of his own men.
They followed suit.

325
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.950
Panic ensued and the battle was over.

326
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.150
Following the conquest of battle on Alexander moved on to Susa and then to the

327
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:48.980
Persian city of Persepolis.
Even at the time,
ends to hunt down and kill Darious,

328
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.470
the disgraced Persian king.
In order to prevent any further reprisals,

329
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.140
he finally found areas,
but he had already been killed.

330
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.270
One of his most trusted men,
Bassa said,

331
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.580
killed him and now claimed the throne for himself,

332
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.640
not links on that announced that it is science on tracking down best who would

333
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.610
flood into Central Asia.
Alexandra explored much of Asia.

334
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.760
He founds a number of cities naming each of them in his own honor.

335
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.660
Eventually basis was betrayed by his own men and handed over for execution.

336
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.440
On his returned to Persia,
Alexander,
he was hailed as the king of kings.

337
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.980
He began to adopt Persian habits including dressing and Persian clothing and

338
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.070
following Persian customers.
This was troubling.
So many Greeks,

339
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:25.320
including some of his generals.
By now,

340
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:28.110
Alexander had been away from Mastodon for many years.

341
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.160
He had left Antipater is the military ruler of the city and he had effectively

342
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:33.780
maintain the peace.
However,

343
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.930
Alexander was obstinately requesting trip reinforcements,

344
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:39.060
which made the defenses of the city weaker.

345
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.450
Alexandra now set his sights on conquering the Indian subcontinent.

346
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.350
He sent delegates ahead of him,
do demands that the Indian leaders submit to him.

347
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.020
Some of the clans acquiesced,
but others didn't.

348
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.190
These glands would be furiously attacked by Alexander's army complete villages.

349
00:18:59.191 --> 00:19:02.580
They were burned to the ground and people were killed with impunity,

350
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.060
the Greek army and met their strongest resistance at the hands of king porous in

351
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:09.360
the Punjab region.
The Indian forces were defeated in battle,

352
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:12.720
but Alexander was so impressed with the tactics and bravery of porous that he

353
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.230
offered a co rulership to him while Alexander weed control the lands,

354
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.860
he would handle the day to day running of Punjab to pour us by.
Now,

355
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:23.580
Alexandra had conquered more territory than any other retailer in history,

356
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.990
but he was still not satisfied.

357
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.460
He wanted to advance even deeper into the Indian subcontinent.
However,
his army,

358
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.910
they didn't.
They are simply out enough.
The soldiers revolted,

359
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.330
refusing to advance any further.
The generals sided with the mint.

360
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.970
One of them general conus told Alexander,

361
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.050
but the man long to again see that parents,
their wives,
their children,

362
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.880
their homeland.
Alexander sympathized and decided that it was time to go home,

363
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.110
but he continued to conquer villages and claim more lands on his return route.

364
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.490
In order to do Blake ages,
man,

365
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:57.480
he sounded older and disabled soldiers directly back to Macedonia,
but this act,

366
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.090
it backfired.
The men thought that they were all going directly home.

367
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.750
We're not Xander march.
Then on further conquests,
there was a lot of anger.

368
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.840
The men of his army,
they began to openly criticize Alexander.

369
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.140
They were especially unhappy with his adoption of Persian customs and the

370
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.560
appointing of Persian officers to command them and an attempt to win favor

371
00:20:13.561 --> 00:20:14.460
Alexander in should.

372
00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:17.610
The Macedonian troops were ruled over by Macedonian officers.

373
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.210
He also held a huge banquet for his men to celebrate the years of victory.

374
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.540
After returning to pasture,

375
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.340
Alexandra established himself and the Great Palace of Nebuchadnezzar.

376
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.310
He plans further campaigns of conquest into a radio,

377
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:31.350
but these would never come to pass.

378
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.380
Alexander died suddenly on June the 10th will be 11 332 BCE.

379
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:47.410
The cause of death is unclear with there being two main theories and both of

380
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:50.560
these there is involved.
The excessive use of alcohol and one accounts.

381
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:54.340
He develops a fever after a 24 hour drinking binge and the other,

382
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.730
he became sick after drinking a bowl of unmixed wine.
Of course,

383
00:20:57.731 --> 00:21:00.640
this also been talk of poisoning the death of the king of kings.

384
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:03.910
At the height of his power was a huge shock to the entire world.

385
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.390
People could not believe that such a strong dynamic and his heroic individual

386
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.210
could be struck down without wanting Alexander's body.

387
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:11.680
It was placed in a gold sarcophagus,

388
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.240
much disputing he was laid to rest and not Axondria even the next centuries.

389
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.060
Then eight famous leaders came to pay respects but his body,

390
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.290
it was not left in peace.

391
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.130
It is said that the Roman Emperor Augustus accidentally damaged the Kolbe.

392
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.670
Since Caligula stole Alexander's breastplates.

393
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.460
Such incidents prompted Emperor Septimius Severus to close the tomb to the

394
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:34.180
public in 200 CE where it was taken is unknown.
Today,

395
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.470
the location of Alexander's tomb is one of history's great mysteries.

396
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.230
So I already have you found that video.
Interesting.
