<v Speaker 1>Liar does some males.</v>

9
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>It on was a much loved revolutionary hero who saved China from the rule of</v>

10
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>foreign aggresses.</v>

11
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>He multiplies China by bringing the ones as of western industrialized nation to</v>

12
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>their shores to others.</v>

13
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Though he is remembered for being a sociopathic Tyron to sacrifice the lives of</v>

14
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:38.441
<v Speaker 1>millions of people in order to bring his political experiment to life.</v>

15
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>In the video today,</v>

16
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the life of the chairman,</v>

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>a farmer and land owner named Malley Chan was a self made man.</v>

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>He was born into poverty,</v>

19
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>but he worked hard and saved enough to buy two acres of rice patties.</v>

20
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Over the years he employed workers tens the lands for him and most of his</v>

21
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>profits went back into expanding his farm.</v>

22
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He builds a comfortable life for his wife when she may and their future</v>

23
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

24
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.621
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

25
00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>his wife had difficulty getting pregnant and she lost her first two children</v>

26
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>during infancy.</v>

27
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth to her only child mouths and Dong in 1883 growing up,</v>

28
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Mousa Dong lived very comfortable life compared to his peers.</v>

29
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It was not uncommon for Chinese children do walk around without shoes and wear</v>

30
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>clothes that were in tatters.</v>

31
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>They barely had enough food to eat and they could not afford proper healthcare.</v>

32
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>The fact that males are dongs parents could afford to provide all of the basic</v>

33
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 1>necessities for their child is why some people considered them to be wealthy.</v>

34
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that Mouser Dong had in common with all of the children in China</v>

35
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>though was that he was taught the religion and philosophy of Confucianism.</v>

36
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.000
<v Speaker 1>One of his most well known teachings is that everyone should try to go with the</v>

37
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>flow means balance,</v>

38
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the energy of ying and Yang.</v>

39
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>When it came to the government,</v>

40
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Confucius said that people should try to be satisfied with their lot in life and</v>

41
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:11.410
<v Speaker 1>they should know their place in order for society to run smoothly.</v>

42
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Confucius says there is governments when the prince is Prince and the minister</v>

43
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.291
<v Speaker 1>is minister.</v>

44
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:18.101
<v Speaker 1>When the father,</v>

45
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:18.934
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

46
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>and the son,</v>

47
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.093
<v Speaker 1>his son,</v>

48
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 1>however males are Dong,</v>

49
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.370
<v Speaker 1>did not agree with everything Confucius taught.</v>

50
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.211
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

51
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 1>he knew from firsthand experience that his father was able to work his way out</v>

52
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:30.574
<v Speaker 1>of poverty.</v>

53
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to believe that he could grow up to be more than just a farmer's son</v>

54
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>in school.</v>

55
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Males that Dorman was one of the top students in his class and he loved reading</v>

56
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>as many books as he could get his hands on butts.</v>

57
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>At 13 years old,</v>

58
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:44.081
<v Speaker 1>his parents,</v>

59
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>they removed him from his elementary school in order to help his father work on</v>

60
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>the farm.</v>

61
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>His father tried to arrange a marriage with a young girl named [inaudible] who</v>

62
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>was the daughter of a nearby farmer and land owner.</v>

63
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>This would have ended his education and completely sealed his fate.</v>

64
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>He refused to marry hard at 16 years of age.</v>

65
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>He convinced his parents that he wanted to be an intellectual and his parents</v>

66
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>agreed to send him to a boarding school and the city of Chang sharp.</v>

67
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>When he was in this city,</v>

68
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>he met other blank minded people who believed that there was a need to change</v>

69
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese way of life in the 18 hundreds China,</v>

70
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.641
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing more and more trade from western countries from 1842 1842 Cheyenna</v>

71
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.814
<v Speaker 1>in Great Britain.</v>

72
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>They had a big conflict known as the opium wars and it's trying to lost.</v>

73
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>After signing the treaty of Nanking,</v>

74
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong became a British territory and European traders now had access to</v>

75
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Chinese ports.</v>

76
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Even though this one's a peace treaty,</v>

77
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese people nicknames this,</v>

78
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>the unequal treaties because it appeared as though the Ching Dynasty was bowing</v>

79
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>to the demands of Great Britain.</v>

80
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>China was far from being an industrialized nation.</v>

81
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>That technology was so far behind the rest of the world.</v>

82
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>It was far too easy for western countries to take advantage.</v>

83
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>In 1895 Japan attempted to overpower China and ran their influence over Korea</v>

84
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and this was known as the first sign Japanese war.</v>

85
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.360
<v Speaker 1>The Cherry on top of an already bad situation came in the year 1908 when the</v>

86
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>emperor passed away.</v>

87
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only male out of the Ching Dynasty was a two year old named per year.</v>

88
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not a surprise that people began to lose their faith in the strength of the</v>

89
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>dynasty in 1911 and Mouser dawn was 18 years old.</v>

90
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>The in high revolution happens and the People's Republic of China broaden ends</v>

91
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>to the Ching Dynasty</v>

92
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 1>off the switching to the People's republic.</v>

93
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 1>The overarching government with calls the Kuomintang also known as the</v>

94
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:38.210
<v Speaker 1>nationalist party or the KMT.</v>

95
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>The Kuomintang allowed warlords to rule over their perspective territories</v>

96
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.543
<v Speaker 1>across China.</v>

97
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Each warlord had the power to create their own laws,</v>

98
00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:47.450
<v Speaker 1>charge taxes,</v>

99
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>and raise their own armies as a university student mows it on.</v>

100
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>His favorite subject was philosophy.</v>

101
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 1>He read the wealth of nations by Adam Smith and the spirits of laws by</v>

102
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Montesquieu.</v>

103
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 1>He also read all of the works of the Chinese revolutionaries who were behind the</v>

104
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 1>People's republic.</v>

105
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.961
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

106
00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>he created the Association for Students,</v>

107
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>self government and said who non fast normal university so that students could</v>

108
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>have a voice to protest against the school rules.</v>

109
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.880
<v Speaker 1>He also formed a student volunteer army.</v>

110
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>The Greeks had around 80 members and they all shared their ideas on government</v>

111
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:18.914
<v Speaker 1>and philosophy.</v>

112
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.970
<v Speaker 1>It was during this time that Mouser don was introduced to the work of Karl Marx.</v>

113
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Out of all the political philosophies they studied,</v>

114
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:28.490
<v Speaker 1>he and his friends agreed with the ideas of communism.</v>

115
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 1>This was because it promised that every person in society would have their basic</v>

116
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:37.250
<v Speaker 1>needs met now's it don't continue to excel in school and he was number three in</v>

117
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:38.450
<v Speaker 1>his graduating class.</v>

118
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.410
<v Speaker 1>He got a job at Beijing University as a librarian where he was able to read as</v>

119
00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Speaker 1>many books as his heart desired.</v>

120
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>The Communist Party of China or CCP was established in 1921 one of the founders</v>

121
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 1>lead does how was a librarian at Peking University.</v>

122
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.680
<v Speaker 1>The other was Chen duck sue,</v>

123
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>who was an intellectual who had been a part of the People's Republic of China.</v>

124
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.781
<v Speaker 1>After seeing how,</v>

125
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>trying to adjust to the new republic docs who believed that the warlords were</v>

126
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage of the peasant class and that the political system needed</v>

127
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>adjusting,</v>

128
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>he thought communism would actually be better for that society.</v>

129
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Now's the Dong was just 28 years old at the time and he was one of the many</v>

130
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>young people who began attending communist meetings after work.</v>

131
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Once people began to learn about the teachings of Karl Marx,</v>

132
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>the Communist Party of China gains a huge following.</v>

133
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Many peasant people were unhappy with their respective warlords and they wanted</v>

134
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>a new system of governments.</v>

135
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

136
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>communism was posing a huge threat to the nationalist party and like the rest of</v>

137
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>the parties in the republic,</v>

138
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>communism actually had the potential to spread across the entire country and</v>

139
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>replace them as the leading party.</v>

140
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>They believed it was time to get rid of the communists in China before they</v>

141
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 1>gains too much power.</v>

142
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>In 1927 and gang working for the KMT attacked and killed members of the</v>

143
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party,</v>

144
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>or they announced the plan to eradicate every single member of the CCP.</v>

145
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>This events is remembered as the Shanghai massacre role.</v>

146
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:05.351
<v Speaker 1>The April the 12th patch over 300,000 communists were killed and 50,000 people</v>

147
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>denounced fat party affiliation out of fear.</v>

148
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>The Shanghai massacre is credited with starting the Chinese civil war.</v>

149
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Since the KMT was the original party of the Republic of China,</v>

150
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>they felt that it was time for them to eliminate the feudal system of warlords</v>

151
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>and the communists as well in order to unite all of China under one government.</v>

152
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>In 1931 when Mouser Dong was 48 years old,</v>

153
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>he was elected as the chairman of the Communist Party.</v>

154
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>In 1934 the Chinese civil war was still raging on miles and on led the members</v>

155
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>of the Communist Party and what is remembered as the Long March.</v>

156
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Speaker 1>They tracked over 4,000 miles through mainland China in their attempts to fend</v>

157
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>off KMT forces.</v>

158
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>The leader of the Nationalist Party,</v>

159
00:07:55.671 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Chiang Kai Shek was sending troops after the communists and he ran several</v>

160
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>campaigns and his attempts to defeat them mows the dawn did not have an army as</v>

161
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>large as the KMT,</v>

162
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>but he had his charisma wherever they went.</v>

163
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 1>He used his power of persuasion to tell the villages that communism would</v>

164
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>improve their lives.</v>

165
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>He promised them that they would never go hungry again.</v>

166
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>People are so unhappy living under the rule of their warlords that it wasn't</v>

167
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>very hard to convince people to fight for the cause after losing thousands of</v>

168
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 1>men and battles that don would just restock his army with new peasants in the</v>

169
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>next village and just keep on marching forward.</v>

170
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>In 1937 all of China would have to hit pause on their civil war because Japan</v>

171
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>was taking advantage of the chaos by invading Manchuria.</v>

172
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>This was known as the second Sino Japanese war.</v>

173
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.171
<v Speaker 1>For years,</v>

174
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Japan was attempted to take over Chinese territories.</v>

175
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.651
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese,</v>

176
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:46.281
<v Speaker 1>they tortured,</v>

177
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:46.671
<v Speaker 1>they killed,</v>

178
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>they raped Chinese civilians everywhere they went and decimated the Chinese</v>

179
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 1>major cities,</v>

180
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>the armies of the warlords in the KMT,</v>

181
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:55.094
<v Speaker 1>they were already a,</v>

182
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>from the losses they sustained while fighting each other.</v>

183
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>There was no way they could fend off the Japanese empire on their own.</v>

184
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.460
<v Speaker 1>The leader of the KMT Chiang Kai Shek had to swallow his pride and ask the</v>

185
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party for help if they're red army was growing in numbers.</v>

186
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>They defended China against the Japanese and what is known as the hundred</v>

187
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>regiments offensive.</v>

188
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 1>The Red Army was largely made up of peasants who didn't have time for proper</v>

189
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>military training,</v>

190
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>so mouser on used guerrilla warfare tactics.</v>

191
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>They also called in some help of the USSR who closed in on Japanese occupied</v>

192
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Manchuria from the sidewall.</v>

193
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>China is on the other.</v>

194
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>They succeeded in saving the country.</v>

195
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

196
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>once the Japanese were gone,</v>

197
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.703
<v Speaker 1>the civil war,</v>

198
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it was back in 1946 miles a dog and his Red Army defeated the Campti and it</v>

199
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>became the new rulers of China.</v>

200
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.031
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

201
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:46.280
<v Speaker 1>people for Mouser Dong was a national hero and the rightful leader of that</v>

202
00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

203
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he save them from the Japanese,</v>

204
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but the also unified the country under one rule.</v>

205
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>For the first time since the Ching Dynasty,</v>

206
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>people were hopeful that things would finally start to change for the better,</v>

207
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>but actually they were going to get a whole lot worse.</v>

208
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 1>In 1958 miles are Dong officially began his plan.</v>

209
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Speaker 1>This was called the great leap forward.</v>

210
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.800
<v Speaker 1>This was his attempt to use communist ideals to bring modern industrialization</v>

211
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>to China.</v>

212
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.770
<v Speaker 1>He might've had the best intentions at heart,</v>

213
00:10:20.771 --> 00:10:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but may matter how many books one may read about creating a new society.</v>

214
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.010
<v Speaker 1>There is a huge difference between theory and actually doing something in real</v>

215
00:10:30.011 --> 00:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

216
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.940
<v Speaker 1>The greater need forward created a major land reform where citizens,</v>

217
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:36.070
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer allowed to own private property.</v>

218
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Farmers had to give up their lands to the greater good of the public.</v>

219
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.510
<v Speaker 1>They still have to work,</v>

220
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but they were not allowed to keep the food they were growing because the rules</v>

221
00:10:43.511 --> 00:10:48.130
<v Speaker 1>dictated that people who were far more important to society deserve nourishment</v>

222
00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:51.760
<v Speaker 1>first and that the peasants could be fed with whatever was leftover.</v>

223
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>He sent medical services do all Chinese villagers ensuring that all of the</v>

224
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:59.290
<v Speaker 1>citizens have healthcare and they were fit enough to do manual labor.</v>

225
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.041
<v Speaker 1>He commands it.</v>

226
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Many of the people of China to start constructing factories and new governmental</v>

227
00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:04.954
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>

228
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Most peasants weren't farmers their entire lives and they had no idea how to</v>

229
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.880
<v Speaker 1>work in a factory.</v>

230
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:10.361
<v Speaker 1>Still they,</v>

231
00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:14.440
<v Speaker 1>they were expected to produce steel and other industrialized materials.</v>

232
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.110
<v Speaker 1>There were so many people now working in factories.</v>

233
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible to properly train or manage everyone despite having a lot of</v>

234
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.740
<v Speaker 1>issues getting adjusted to the new policy of the plan.</v>

235
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It actually worked for a very short window of time.</v>

236
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Crop production went up and people were healthy.</v>

237
00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Aaron's had more food to eat than ever before.</v>

238
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Despite the setbacks.</v>

239
00:11:33.011 --> 00:11:35.120
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese people were also able to Iraq,</v>

240
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.280
<v Speaker 1>a few modern buildings.</v>

241
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.510
<v Speaker 1>This progress,</v>

242
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.330
<v Speaker 1>it all came crashing down in less than a year ago.</v>

243
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:44.740
<v Speaker 1>This happened in the winter of 1959 miles or dawn had suggested that farmers</v>

244
00:11:44.741 --> 00:11:48.010
<v Speaker 1>grow more grain and this was stored in silos.</v>

245
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.491
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

246
00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 1>without grabbing other types of food to store for the winter months,</v>

247
00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it men,</v>

248
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>the people were to survive only on bread and the winter.</v>

249
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>The weather that year,</v>

250
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>it was awful as well.</v>

251
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 1>They experienced widespread droughts,</v>

252
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>followed by massive typhoons that caused the flooding that destroyed crops,</v>

253
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 1>tigers,</v>

254
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:04.631
<v Speaker 1>leopards,</v>

255
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>and wolves were attacking farmers as they tried to cultivate more lands.</v>

256
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

257
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>mal created an antipasto campaign where he encouraged people to shoot these</v>

258
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:14.530
<v Speaker 1>animals on site and eat their meat.</v>

259
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 1>This push tigers and leopards near extinction as people killed 75% of their</v>

260
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:20.434
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

261
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>The great leap forward with actually a huge step backwards for China and is it</v>

262
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>created a widespread famine that killed millions of people.</v>

263
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>People resorted to eating household pets like dogs and cats just in order to</v>

264
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

265
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Some even resorted to cannibalism.</v>

266
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>In 1959 he was so unpopular that he had to step down as the chairman of the</v>

267
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party and he handed over his position as state chairman to a more</v>

268
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>moderate party representative.</v>

269
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Thee shall Qui,</v>

270
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.100
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

271
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.651
<v Speaker 1>mows it on,</v>

272
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>continued to work in a leading position in the governments and tried to run his</v>

273
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>great leap forward from behind the scenes.</v>

274
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Instead of recognizing that his policy was doomed to fail mouser dawn was</v>

275
00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>convinced that this was just bad luck and it's press the people to keep going.</v>

276
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

277
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 1>people just continued to die year after year.</v>

278
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

279
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:09.610
<v Speaker 1>in 1961 the great leap forward,</v>

280
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>it was canceled by the time he finally ended the policy.</v>

281
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>36 million people that died.</v>

282
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

283
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.430
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that after being responsible for the deaths of millions of people</v>

284
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:28.130
<v Speaker 1>and somehow not being killed for it,</v>

285
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.881
<v Speaker 1>the had no,</v>

286
00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:29.930
<v Speaker 1>it was time to quit,</v>

287
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.220
<v Speaker 1>but in 1966 miles of dawn trying to regain the trust of the people and become</v>

288
00:13:34.221 --> 00:13:35.001
<v Speaker 1>state chairman,</v>

289
00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:35.834
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

290
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.890
<v Speaker 1>he has a place,</v>

291
00:13:36.891 --> 00:13:39.590
<v Speaker 1>the blame for his mistakes somewhere else.</v>

292
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 1>He claims that the Bosch was he the top 1% of society were ruining everything</v>

293
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.730
<v Speaker 1>and that Mao himself,</v>

294
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.500
<v Speaker 1>he was on the side of the peasants.</v>

295
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.110
<v Speaker 1>He builds up a cult of personality and people,</v>

296
00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:54.020
<v Speaker 1>they strongly supported them again because well,</v>

297
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.710
<v Speaker 1>they remembered him as a revolutionary hero who saved their country from the</v>

298
00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and provided them with food rations and free healthcare is fully was.</v>

299
00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:04.460
<v Speaker 1>They were willing to do whatever you asked.</v>

300
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.270
<v Speaker 1>He knew from his days as a college student that young people were perfect for</v>

301
00:14:08.271 --> 00:14:09.830
<v Speaker 1>molding into revolutionaries.</v>

302
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.850
<v Speaker 1>He convinced a group of students called the Red God to seek out anyone who was</v>

303
00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:15.800
<v Speaker 1>speaking out against the Communist Party.</v>

304
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.610
<v Speaker 1>He encouraged them to even murder their professors who spoke against Mao's</v>

305
00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:22.580
<v Speaker 1>policies just in order to make an example of them.</v>

306
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.140
<v Speaker 1>According to some accounts smells,</v>

307
00:14:24.141 --> 00:14:25.850
<v Speaker 1>red guards swept so savage,</v>

308
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:30.851
<v Speaker 1>they partook in flesh and banquets or ritualistic cannibalism if their enemies</v>

309
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.260
<v Speaker 1>mouser dorm called the USSR and North Korea treater revisionist.</v>

310
00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:39.410
<v Speaker 1>See what bastardizing the original work of Karl Marx.</v>

311
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.890
<v Speaker 1>His interpretation of communism was so different from the rest of the world that</v>

312
00:14:42.891 --> 00:14:47.270
<v Speaker 1>many people call his philosophy Maoism instead of isolating is people from the</v>

313
00:14:47.271 --> 00:14:49.430
<v Speaker 1>outside world like other communist nations.</v>

314
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 1>He encouraged globalization,</v>

315
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.011
<v Speaker 1>open trade,</v>

316
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>which is why China's economy eventually rebounded and did need this actually set</v>

317
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>the stage for the economic strength that China has today.</v>

318
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.270
<v Speaker 1>In 1968 the minister of Pakistan brought a gift of 14 mangoes to chairman.</v>

319
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

320
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>people of China had never eaten tropical fruit before,</v>

321
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 1>so this was a delicacy to them.</v>

322
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Now could impossibly 40 mangoes on his own,</v>

323
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>so he hands down with the fruit twist political team and a couple got in the</v>

324
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 1>hands of a group of factory workers.</v>

325
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>They were so mesmerized by this magical sweet fruit that they literally started</v>

326
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 1>to wash a bit saying that it was a symbol of the wonderful new things that</v>

327
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Chairman Mao would bring to their land.</v>

328
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>They taste it in a glass case and when the freeway went bad,</v>

329
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>they replaced it with a wax replica.</v>

330
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>One man who had never tried mango before questioned why everyone was worshiping</v>

331
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>this piece of fruit.</v>

332
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>He tried to compare it to a sweet potato.</v>

333
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 1>You simply couldn't believe that mangoes could taste so great.</v>

334
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Well then it got a little bit ridiculous because even the mere suggestion that a</v>

335
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:54.040
<v Speaker 1>mango wasn't a magical fruit was enough to kill a man for treason.</v>

336
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>This is just one of many examples of how irrationally devoted to Mouser Dong.</v>

337
00:15:58.431 --> 00:15:59.820
<v Speaker 1>People were in the,</v>

338
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 1>in 1970 when the country was running low on building supplies,</v>

339
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Mouser don audit his workers to tear down the Great Wall of China in order to</v>

340
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:11.360
<v Speaker 1>use the bricks to build new houses and the damned you also destroyed engine dot</v>

341
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 1>worker or anything else that was considered to be a symbol of the bourgeoisie.</v>

342
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 1>He was willing to dismantle thousands of years of Chinese history and culture in</v>

343
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 1>order to execute is communist vision.</v>

344
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.390
<v Speaker 1>When he was getting older and Mouser don was shameless when it came to you</v>

345
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:33.760
<v Speaker 1>reaping the benefits of being a communist dictator.</v>

346
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.050
<v Speaker 1>You almost never bathed or brushed his teeth and claims that he fenced himself</v>

347
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.590
<v Speaker 1>inside the bodies of his mistresses and not surprisingly,</v>

348
00:16:41.591 --> 00:16:44.700
<v Speaker 1>he contracted sexually transmitted infections and spread them deep.</v>

349
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Several women who actually wore their illness as something of a badge of honor</v>

350
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:51.160
<v Speaker 1>since it was given to them by Chairman Mao.</v>

351
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

352
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.930
<v Speaker 1>When he was in his sixties he appointed a 16 year old girl named Jan Yufeng to</v>

353
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:57.250
<v Speaker 1>be his personal secretary.</v>

354
00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.300
<v Speaker 1>She spent so much time with him that even Mao Zedong's wife had to go through</v>

355
00:17:01.301 --> 00:17:05.260
<v Speaker 1>January thing first before she could make an appointment and speak with her</v>

356
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:06.010
<v Speaker 1>husband.</v>

357
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:10.930
<v Speaker 1>In 1973 he was sitting in a trade meeting with Henry Kissinger and he reportedly</v>

358
00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:14.740
<v Speaker 1>offered to trade 10 million Chinese women to the United States.</v>

359
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He said that women caused too many problems and that it would be better to just</v>

360
00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:19.480
<v Speaker 1>get rid of them.</v>

361
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.340
<v Speaker 1>In 1974 his third wife,</v>

362
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful actress Jane Chin,</v>

363
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.100
<v Speaker 1>decided that she would not sit around waiting for husbands,</v>

364
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 1>respect and affection.</v>

365
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.460
<v Speaker 1>She began gathering our own collection of young male lovers.</v>

366
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.270
<v Speaker 1>She got so bold she wouldn't even allow her boyfriend's do show up at the house</v>

367
00:17:34.271 --> 00:17:37.240
<v Speaker 1>and now never protested against our fas.</v>

368
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.220
<v Speaker 1>When he died in 1976 people,</v>

369
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.510
<v Speaker 1>they were devastated him.</v>

370
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.320
<v Speaker 1>He was buried in a crystal caskets so that people could see his body when they</v>

371
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:47.800
<v Speaker 1>came to visit lines of people queued up to pay their respects,</v>

372
00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.240
<v Speaker 1>and many of them openly,</v>

373
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>when they saw the body of their dear leader,</v>

374
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.740
<v Speaker 1>even to this day,</v>

375
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>the memory of males are Dong is revered by many as they remember him.</v>

376
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the great heroes of the nation,</v>

377
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 1>but loving more hasten China would be a very different place today if it was not</v>

378
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.130
<v Speaker 1>for malice.</v>

379
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Saddam maybe without him trying to,</v>

380
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 1>would have never become a leading economic power house,</v>

381
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but maybe without seven millions of people would not have died is the chairman</v>

382
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

383
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.700
<v Speaker 1>not exactly the cheeriest of subjects,</v>

384
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.111
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

385
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>can take the edge off his communist ways?</v>

386
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

387
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 1>a cocktail,</v>

388
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's convenient because today's video is brought to you by Shaker and</v>

389
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>

390
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

391
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:23.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

392
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to mix up some cocktails at work because I'm not don draper.</v>

393
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>So let's through the magic of television and travel home.</v>

394
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:30.751
<v Speaker 3>Hello,</v>

395
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 3>welcome to my home.</v>

396
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Let's make some cocktails.</v>

397
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

398
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.450
<v Speaker 3>So we have Shaker and spoon.</v>

399
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.480
<v Speaker 3>You get three cocktails that you get to have a crack at this month.</v>

400
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.580
<v Speaker 3>They are the spice of life tea and honey and the mighty creek cobbler.</v>

401
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Now I believe that gets them,</v>

402
00:18:57.851 --> 00:19:00.760
<v Speaker 3>so we used one of these hydrated mandarin wheels,</v>

403
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.140
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to make this,</v>

404
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.410
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly with Irish whiskey and a half a bottle of Irish whiskey on hand,</v>

405
00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:06.244
<v Speaker 3>so that's a good thing.</v>

406
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.420
<v Speaker 3>First step,</v>

407
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.160
<v Speaker 3>I need to crush some ice.</v>

408
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.043
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

409
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Now with Shaker and spoon,</v>

410
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 3>it's available in the u s obviously I'm not there,</v>

411
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Speaker 3>so they make special accommodations and send me this stuff internationally,</v>

412
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:27.450
<v Speaker 3>which I really appreciate.</v>

413
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 3>They normally ship the fruit with them I to by my own orange,</v>

414
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 3>but don't worry everything you need except for the booze comes in the box.</v>

415
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I also worry this orange is absolutely massive and might not actually fit in my</v>

416
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:41.184
<v Speaker 3>gloss.</v>

417
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

418
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 3>This is a fine looking orange.</v>

419
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Good news or my needs it bit them in the glass.</v>

420
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I should read the recipe I suppose before I start with these things,</v>

421
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 3>but the two big,</v>

422
00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 3>even when my shaker,</v>

423
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.310
<v Speaker 3>this is a ridiculously huge orange.</v>

424
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to cut them in half and put them in like that because apparently</v>

425
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 3>my local shop sells mucins oranges,</v>

426
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.130
<v Speaker 3>one and a half ounces of orange spice syrup.</v>

427
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

428
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.651
<v Speaker 3>Go Myself.</v>

429
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:13.951
<v Speaker 3>One of these.</v>

430
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like it was such a bartender we like and it makes that,</v>

431
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.480
<v Speaker 3>that nice ringing sound,</v>

432
00:20:19.481 --> 00:20:20.314
<v Speaker 3>so put that in there.</v>

433
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Pop that in there.</v>

434
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

435
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.260
<v Speaker 3>A muddle of that.</v>

436
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 3>Six seconds.</v>

437
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 3>You know what's cool?</v>

438
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know what modeling is,</v>

439
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.640
<v Speaker 3>it tells you right here using a muddler press fruit or herbs into the bottom of</v>

440
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 3>the glass,</v>

441
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.070
<v Speaker 3>usually with added sugar or syrup.</v>

442
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.083
<v Speaker 3>When muddling.</v>

443
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Be careful not to destroy the fruit or herbs you want to release their island</v>

444
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:40.950
<v Speaker 3>flavor.</v>

445
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Not Pulverize.</v>

446
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.590
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a muddler.</v>

447
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they sent me a muddler.</v>

448
00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 3>I think I lost it.</v>

449
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.033
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

450
