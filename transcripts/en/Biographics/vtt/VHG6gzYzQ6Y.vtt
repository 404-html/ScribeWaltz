1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.520
<v Speaker 1>He was a force of nature,</v>

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the quintessential Aussie outdoorsman with this wicked sense of humor and his</v>

3
00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 1>insatiable passion for wildlife.</v>

4
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Steve Irwin,</v>

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>the crocodile hunter,</v>

6
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.850
<v Speaker 1>became a worldwide celebrity.</v>

7
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>He shone a spotlight on man's mismanagement of our natural resources and</v>

8
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.191
<v Speaker 1>champions.</v>

9
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>The plays of the planet's most vulnerable inhabitants,</v>

10
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.753
<v Speaker 1>the animals,</v>

11
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>but Steve was also a dare devil,</v>

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>constantly pushing the limits in his interactions with the wiles.</v>

13
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Then in a tragic moments,</v>

14
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>he was gone,</v>

15
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>taken from us far too soon.</v>

16
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>In today's biographics,</v>

17
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>we get to grips with the crocodile hunter from down under</v>

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Steven Robertson.</v>

19
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>When was born on February the 22nd 1962 in Melbourne,</v>

20
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:54.134
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

21
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Both of his parents were passionate about wildlife is father Bob was a plumber,</v>

22
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>but he was also a keen hepatologist who studied amphibians while his mother Lynn</v>

23
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>was a wildlife rehabilitator.</v>

24
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>When Steve was just a few years old,</v>

25
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>the family moved to Queensland's where Bob and Lynn opens the Queensland Reptile</v>

26
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:09.524
<v Speaker 1>and Foreigner Park.</v>

27
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Steve therefore grew up around his reps and was and we're soon put to work at</v>

28
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>the park.</v>

29
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>He would clean out the cages and feed the crocodiles and the lizards.</v>

30
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.600
<v Speaker 1>By the age of six,</v>

31
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>he was accustomed to being around creatures that most children would be</v>

32
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:21.374
<v Speaker 1>terrified of.</v>

33
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>His whole existence was surrounded by wildlife from crocodiles to Kangaroos to</v>

34
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>wireless.</v>

35
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>The Iowans develops their reptile park from nothing.</v>

36
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>They spend the first couple of years living in a caravan while they slowly added</v>

37
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>to that animal inventory.</v>

38
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>The first snakes they put on display where ones the Bob and Steve captured while</v>

39
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>out fishing.</v>

40
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile then was busy rehabilitating orphans,</v>

41
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Joey's Kangaroos,</v>

42
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:41.331
<v Speaker 1>Koalas,</v>

43
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:41.691
<v Speaker 1>wombats,</v>

44
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.051
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

45
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:42.884
<v Speaker 1>and craze.</v>

46
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

47
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>she was raising three children of her own Steve proof to be a mischievous child</v>

48
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>who was always testing the patients of his father.</v>

49
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>He would constantly go missing,</v>

50
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>only to be discovered down at the local creek or chasing visits.</v>

51
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Yet he wasn't being rebellious.</v>

52
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to find venomous snakes and lizards so the team could show them to his</v>

53
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>dad and to win his approval,</v>

54
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>but rather than making him proud,</v>

55
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Steve's constant wanderings left.</v>

56
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Bob Frustrated there.</v>

57
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Boy was hyperactive.</v>

58
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>He never sat still from the age of two.</v>

59
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 1>He developed a skill and to love for climbing trees.</v>

60
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that his family members would do when he went missing was</v>

61
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>look up on the way to school.</v>

62
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>If he saw a dead reptile lying on the road,</v>

63
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Steve would make his mother stylists so that he could get out and investigate.</v>

64
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.690
<v Speaker 1>When he was six years old,</v>

65
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>he got the best present.</v>

66
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He could have wished for a 12 foot long python.</v>

67
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Steve Absolutely adored his new best friend at school.</v>

68
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Steve was considered a bit of an oddity by his peers.</v>

69
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't into the normal boy things like bicycle sports and skateboards.</v>

70
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>He spends his lunchtimes wandering around the school yards and looking for</v>

71
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:41.481
<v Speaker 1>birds,</v>

72
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:42.051
<v Speaker 1>lizards,</v>

73
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and any other creatures that he could find.</v>

74
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>After a while,</v>

75
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>other kids got involved looking to Steve as the local experts on all things</v>

76
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>related to wildlife.</v>

77
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Baba when was a hero and a mentor to his son.</v>

78
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>He was a wildlife innovator who was at the cutting edge of animal husbandry with</v>

79
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the wildlife park established the good supply of smaller reptiles and animals.</v>

80
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>What would the sizes?</v>

81
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>It was time to add a couple of crocodiles.</v>

82
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It took nine year old Steve with him on his first crocodile humps as expected,</v>

83
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>the boy was extremely active and it was all his dad could do to keep them in the</v>

84
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

85
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>When a crock was cited,</v>

86
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Steve would want to be the first one to grab it.</v>

87
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>He was positioned at the front of the boat with a spotlight while his father was</v>

88
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:21.350
<v Speaker 1>operating the outboard motor.</v>

89
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>As they got close,</v>

90
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Steve fixed desires and what he thought was a small CROC.</v>

91
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Then he bounced out of the boat and it's got into the water grabbing us by the</v>

92
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

93
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but the boy he didn't realize how launched this crocodile was.</v>

94
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>It was in fact about the same size as him,</v>

95
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit stronger.</v>

96
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>When it became clear to Bob that his son was getting the worst of the encounter,</v>

97
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>he reached his arm into the water and scoops up both of them scooping the boy</v>

98
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.111
<v Speaker 1>hams,</v>

99
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>the Croc into the boat and pinning the animal down with his body recovering</v>

100
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

101
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Steve took over the job of holding down the crock with a huge smile on his face.</v>

102
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the proudest moments of his life so far.</v>

103
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>In the early seventies reports of crocodiles attacking people were becoming more</v>

104
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>and more frequent around Australia.</v>

105
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>As the stock of crocodiles at the reptile park grew,</v>

106
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Bob decided to involve himself in attempts to resolve the conflicts between</v>

107
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles and humans.</v>

108
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>He joins the East Coast Crocodile and management program and he and Steve threw</v>

109
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves into the task of capturing and relocating crocs from areas where</v>

110
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>there was potential for an osteon counter with humans.</v>

111
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It was extremely dangerous work,</v>

112
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>but it was exciting and young.</v>

113
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Steve Excels is this,</v>

114
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>here's a natural gift for not only locating the crocs,</v>

115
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but also for capturing them.</v>

116
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>He would get absolutely focused on catching a crocodile as if you were entering</v>

117
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>into one on one combat with us.</v>

118
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Once the CROC was secured and subdued in his nest,</v>

119
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>he would get a huge adrenaline rush,</v>

120
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 1>which would make him keen for the next encounter,</v>

121
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>but at the time he was in his late teens.</v>

122
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Steve was living in the Bush for extended periods of time,</v>

123
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 1>camping out under the stars and spending days at a time in pursuit of a single</v>

124
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>KROC.</v>

125
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>He had to live off the land and the water,</v>

126
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>honing his Bush skills while developing the mystique of the crocodile hunter.</v>

127
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.830
<v Speaker 1>It was grueling work and most of the time Steve was on his own.</v>

128
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>He was young,</v>

129
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.443
<v Speaker 1>he was fit.</v>

130
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>He was keen and he was innovative.</v>

131
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Steve became the most successful crocodile hunter in the land with his grand</v>

132
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>reputation,</v>

133
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.980
<v Speaker 1>came a degree of complacency.</v>

134
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Though he begins to feel that he could do anything.</v>

135
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.011
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

136
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 1>he got a crock back to his camp,</v>

137
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>ready to put it in a crate,</v>

138
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.960
<v Speaker 1>but he neglected to secure the animal's mouth,</v>

139
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.010
<v Speaker 1>not realizing this.</v>

140
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Steve let the Croc out of its nest as he prepared the Christ.</v>

141
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Then with his back turned the crock attacked,</v>

142
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>snapping.</v>

143
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It's huge jaws around his neck.</v>

144
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

145
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Steve Gone out of this situation with nothing but a few holes in his boot.</v>

146
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.180
<v Speaker 1>On another occasion,</v>

147
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Bob Winds up into northern Queensland in search of an infamous crock known as</v>

148
00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:46.764
<v Speaker 1>agro.</v>

149
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>This creature would pop.</v>

150
00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Its head is out of the water right next to the boats.</v>

151
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying the locals.</v>

152
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Bob's goal was to locate the beast and set up a marker so that his son could</v>

153
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>follow up and execute the capture.</v>

154
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Bob located the CROC easily and has made a mark and then overhanging tree so</v>

155
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that Steve would know where to set the trap.</v>

156
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.441
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

157
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>From the moments that he went in,</v>

158
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Steve could feel that agro was stalking him as he was setting the trap or</v>

159
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>something bumped into his boat and his dog again barking.</v>

160
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Steve quickly set the trap and then left.</v>

161
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Now he was simply a matter of watching and waiting.</v>

162
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>On the third day,</v>

163
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Steve headed for the site.</v>

164
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You need to discover that the trap was completely submerged under water.</v>

165
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>The base had been taken and the trap and gone off.</v>

166
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Steve brought his boat close and grabbed a hold of the net's ready to drag the</v>

167
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>capture of crock on deck.</v>

168
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there was a massive upheaval as the crocs smashed into the boat from</v>

169
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:34.724
<v Speaker 1>under the water.</v>

170
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.371
<v Speaker 1>A stun.</v>

171
00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Steve managed to maintain his grip on the nest,</v>

172
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>but then another blow rock to the boat and then another,</v>

173
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 1>but Steve,</v>

174
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>he held on Mandy.</v>

175
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>He began dragging the net in.</v>

176
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

177
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>he managed to get the tail on board,</v>

178
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>but then the entire body of the CROC catapulted out of the water and into the</v>

179
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:51.381
<v Speaker 1>air coming down.</v>

180
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Besides Steve in the boat,</v>

181
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>the man and his doc immediately jumped into the water.</v>

182
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Steve now grabbed what every good bronch's ropes,</v>

183
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>mud and threw it on top of the violently thrashing crocodile.</v>

184
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>The ideal thing here would have been to blindfold the animal,</v>

185
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>but that was out of the question.</v>

186
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Steve then jumps into the boat and onto the back of the crocodile.</v>

187
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>He threw more nursing over the beast trying to cover its eyes and then he finds</v>

188
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.270
<v Speaker 1>up the outboard motor and started for sure all the way back the crocodile faults</v>

189
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>so violently that Steve was convinced the boat was going to split a pass.</v>

190
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Steve finally goes to the one ton crocodile secured and restraints back at his</v>

191
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>camp is next.</v>

192
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Problem was how to move it.</v>

193
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It decided to go back to a local farm and recruit some helpers,</v>

194
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>but when the cane farmers saw the size of angry,</v>

195
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>they refuse to get out of their boat.</v>

196
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Steve had to resort to getting a front end loader to shift the CROC.</v>

197
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It was experiences like this that Tan Steve into a local legends,</v>

198
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 1>but Steve had mixed feelings.</v>

199
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.880
<v Speaker 1>He felt bad to the DNC,</v>

200
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>remove agro from his natural environment.</v>

201
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.863
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

202
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 1>by 1990 Steve had recaptured more than a hundred crocs.</v>

203
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were kept at the reptile park while the majority were released into</v>

204
00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 1>the wild.</v>

205
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>In 1991 Bob and Lynn decided that Steve had come of age and was ready to take</v>

206
00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>control of the park.</v>

207
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Steve's goal was to make his parents proud and he knew he would do this by</v>

208
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:14.741
<v Speaker 1>turning the park,</v>

209
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:19.030
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the greatest wildlife facilities on the face of the earth is first</v>

210
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.310
<v Speaker 1>step was to rename the park Australia Zoo.</v>

211
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 1>He then threw himself into creating the most exciting educational and</v>

212
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.870
<v Speaker 1>entertaining wildlife experience that zoo visitors would ever experience.</v>

213
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.350
<v Speaker 1>The highlights would be the crocodile show where Steve would be right up close</v>

214
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and personal with crocs totally in control and showing no fear.</v>

215
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.640
<v Speaker 1>He would tell the crowds what passionate and loving animals they work with is</v>

216
00:08:39.641 --> 00:08:40.720
<v Speaker 1>huge personality,</v>

217
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>boundless energy.</v>

218
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.120
<v Speaker 1>He quickly one over the public and attendance figures went through the roof</v>

219
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>in 1991 among the tens of thousands of visitors to Australia Zoo was Terry rain.</v>

220
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a veterinarian and animal lover from the United States.</v>

221
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>She was looking for a place to relocate cougars that had been used in the</v>

222
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>entertainment industry.</v>

223
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 1>She was drawn to their crocodile demonstration and the fast talking Aussie who</v>

224
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>was in there with the deadly creatures,</v>

225
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Terri,</v>

226
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>she wrote down her immediate impressions of Steve.</v>

227
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was no one like this anywhere in the world.</v>

228
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>He sounded like an environmental Tarzan,</v>

229
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>a larger than life superhero guy.</v>

230
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Steve managed to catch sight of Terry and the crowd and according to him it was</v>

231
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>love at first sight.</v>

232
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The two kindred spirits were engaged for months after their first encounter.</v>

233
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>They married in Eugene,</v>

234
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>

235
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Terry's hometown on June the fourth 1992 the honeymoon was spent hunting.</v>

236
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Crocodiles in northern Queensland does say that Terry was out of our elements on</v>

237
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 1>this trip would be an understatement.</v>

238
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>She had never been into the Hash Australia and Alice and she definitely hadn't</v>

239
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>been on a crocodile hunter before,</v>

240
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 1>but trusting implicitly in the man that she referred to as her prince,</v>

241
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>she threw herself into the experience,</v>

242
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 1>the company,</v>

243
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 1>the winds on their honeymoon adventure with Steve's friends,</v>

244
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 1>John Stainton,</v>

245
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>stains in films,</v>

246
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>the action of the CROC hands and other adventures including Terry's first</v>

247
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>encounter with a six foot long black snake.</v>

248
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>This footage became the first episode of a new animal planet TV show called the</v>

249
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>crocodile hunter.</v>

250
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>The series which featured both Steve and Terry was so successful that a second</v>

251
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Speaker 1>and then a third series were ordered.</v>

252
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It was a hit in over 130 countries with hundreds of millions of people embracing</v>

253
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Steve's lovable and over the top.</v>

254
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Aussie personality is trademark catch phrase,</v>

255
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 1>cranky became known the world over.</v>

256
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Crikey Kreigan the final episodes of series three.</v>

257
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>We're entitled at Steve's last adventure.</v>

258
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It followed him across the world as he embarked upon adventures everywhere from</v>

259
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>the Himalayas to South Africa and China.</v>

260
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>The Crocodile Hunter series allowed Steve to take his conservation message to</v>

261
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

262
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>He viewed it as his life's mission to work tirelessly to save the world's</v>

263
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 1>endangered species.</v>

264
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 1>As a result of his name recognition,</v>

265
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>he became the front man for a number of media campaigns and became the</v>

266
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 1>passionate ambassador for Australia and tourism,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Steve Crusaded for wildlife preservation,</v>

268
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>using his fame to bring the issue to the public consciousness in the late 1990s</v>

269
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 1>he also discovered a new species of sea turtle and was at the forefront if a</v>

270
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 1>campaign against animal poaching.</v>

271
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>He also funds in large nature reserves,</v>

272
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>not just in Australia but also in Fiji.</v>

273
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Vanuatu and the United States.</v>

274
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Irwin's TV series fame led some more television and even some movie work.</v>

275
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 1>He appears in 2000 and one's doctor Doolittle to as himself and then started in</v>

276
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the crocodile hunter collision course the following year in 2006 he provided the</v>

277
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 1>voice for an elephant seal named Trev in the movie happy feet.</v>

278
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.510
<v Speaker 1>The money that Steve made from his TV and movie appearances was poured into</v>

279
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>building new exhibits for Australia Zoo and for funding conservation projects.</v>

280
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.280
<v Speaker 1>The zoo was designed as an animal park with the comfort of the animals being the</v>

281
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>foremost concern.</v>

282
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Fences and cages would only be used when absolutely necessary.</v>

283
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>The staff at the zoo grew to about 50 and the area grew to take up about a</v>

284
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:56.570
<v Speaker 1>hundred acres.</v>

285
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:56.810
<v Speaker 1>This year.</v>

286
00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>He won the award for Best Australian tourist attraction in 2003 to 2004 and 2004</v>

287
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:06.120
<v Speaker 1>the Australian animal hospital was opened right next to the zoo hospital cancer</v>

288
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 1>for around 6,000 animals each year in 2006 Australia.</v>

289
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:10.714
<v Speaker 1>As you retail,</v>

290
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the Australian tourism retailing,</v>

291
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Steven Terry had two children together.</v>

292
00:12:25.051 --> 00:12:30.051
<v Speaker 1>I've been de born in 1998 and Robert in 2003 Bindeez birth was filmed and shown</v>

293
00:12:30.171 --> 00:12:32.000
<v Speaker 1>on TV for the crocodile hunter series.</v>

294
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Steve had been filming for the show when he got the call that Terry's waters had</v>

295
00:12:35.271 --> 00:12:35.930
<v Speaker 1>broken.</v>

296
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.920
<v Speaker 1>He turns up at the hospital two hours later with a complete film group in tow.</v>

297
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Terry was surprised about sounds.</v>

298
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:42.110
<v Speaker 1>What was her nature?</v>

299
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.400
<v Speaker 1>She took it all in their stride.</v>

300
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.220
<v Speaker 1>They were both delighted when they found out they had a baby girl.</v>

301
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Steve knew instantly what the name was going to be.</v>

302
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Windy sue after his favorite CROC and his favorite dog,</v>

303
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Steve was the self proclaimed proudest father on the face of the earth.</v>

304
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.580
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't been de bonded instantly becoming virtually inseparable.</v>

305
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.800
<v Speaker 1>She winds on to her first wildlife documentary,</v>

306
00:13:00.801 --> 00:13:02.120
<v Speaker 1>shoot it just six days old.</v>

307
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Then the would grow up in the international spotlight starring in our own show</v>

308
00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Bindi jungle girl when she was eight years old.</v>

309
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Although the series adds the year after Steve's passing,</v>

310
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.090
<v Speaker 1>it was shot before he died and so he featured in several episodes.</v>

311
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 1>November of 2003 found Steve Filming a documentary off the coast of Baja,</v>

312
00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:33.230
<v Speaker 1>California Peninsula in Mexico about sea lions or report came through the boat's</v>

313
00:13:33.231 --> 00:13:35.840
<v Speaker 1>radio that a pair of scuba divers were missing in the area.</v>

314
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Steve immediately shut down filming and join the search.</v>

315
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.290
<v Speaker 1>The next state members of his crew found one of the divers thinking to a rocky</v>

316
00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:45.770
<v Speaker 1>cliff edge Stevens and other rescuer broad the man back to their boat.</v>

317
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.480
<v Speaker 1>The other man's body was located a short time after in early 2004 Steve made the</v>

318
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Speaker 1>news for the wrong reasons when video was shown of him feeding a Checkin Caucus,</v>

319
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>do a 12 and a half.</v>

320
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:59.660
<v Speaker 1>It's salt water crocodile while holding his one month old infant son Charles</v>

321
00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Welfare and animal rights groups are like a,</v>

322
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:04.190
<v Speaker 1>condemns the action with some referring to it as child abuse,</v>

323
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.850
<v Speaker 1>but if Steven Terry contended that he had full control over the situation,</v>

324
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.710
<v Speaker 1>nevertheless Steve did apologize.</v>

325
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Doing so on the American channel,</v>

326
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:11.990
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>

327
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.620
<v Speaker 1>the incidents prompted the Queensland's government's to enact a law stating that</v>

328
00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:19.970
<v Speaker 1>no one trains persons or children were allowed inside a crocodile enclosure.</v>

329
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Steve was also criticized for his conservation views,</v>

330
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.330
<v Speaker 1>which some viewed as overly simplistic and weighted towards tourism.</v>

331
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.170
<v Speaker 1>The Sydney Morning Herald wrote to that his message boil down to eating reason.</v>

332
00:14:30.171 --> 00:14:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Crocs is bad for tourism and therefore more cruel than eating other animals.</v>

333
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.031
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

334
00:14:35.031 --> 00:14:39.350
<v Speaker 1>however other industry experts who poured preys upon oh and and the work that he</v>

335
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:42.410
<v Speaker 1>had done to raise the public's awareness of conservation issues.</v>

336
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.221
<v Speaker 1>Mark towns ends,</v>

337
00:14:43.221 --> 00:14:47.150
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of Queensland's RSBC called him a modern day Noah,</v>

338
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.270
<v Speaker 1>while the Canadian environmentalist remarks after Steve's passing,</v>

339
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>that humanity will not protect that which we fear or do not understand.</v>

340
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Steva when helps us understand those things that many people thought were a</v>

341
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 1>nuisance at best or at worst,</v>

342
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 1>that's made him a great educator.</v>

343
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's conservationist Steve's zone,</v>

344
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>conservation mentor,</v>

345
00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>what was British conservationist and a film maker.</v>

346
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>So David Attenborough and month after Steve's death Terrio when presented</v>

347
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Attenborough with a lifetime achievement award and his acceptance speech.</v>

348
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So David praised Steve saying that he taught people how wonderful and exciting</v>

349
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.593
<v Speaker 1>nature was.</v>

350
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.350
<v Speaker 1>And he was a born communicator</v>

351
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.170
<v Speaker 1>throughout is 44 years.</v>

352
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Steve had taken on and defeated many of the most dangerous creatures on the</v>

353
00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:39.030
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

354
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It was ironic then that the animal that would get the better of him was saying</v>

355
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:43.860
<v Speaker 1>normally tranquil fish.</v>

356
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>On September the fourth 2006 he was filming off Australia's Great Barrier Reef</v>

357
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.820
<v Speaker 1>for a documentary to be called oceans deadliest.</v>

358
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.680
<v Speaker 1>The weather had been bad for several days,</v>

359
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.800
<v Speaker 1>so Steve had been sitting around with little to do but wait for the weather to</v>

360
00:15:55.801 --> 00:15:56.820
<v Speaker 1>improve that day.</v>

361
00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:59.310
<v Speaker 1>He decided to do some snorkeling in the shallow waters,</v>

362
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.000
<v Speaker 1>which could be films for his daughter Bindeez New TV show you've got down into</v>

363
00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:03.480
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

364
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.680
<v Speaker 1>which was only at chest height.</v>

365
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Seeing a large blue bull sting ray,</v>

366
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.880
<v Speaker 1>he came over the top of it in order to film it.</v>

367
00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:09.720
<v Speaker 1>As it swam away,</v>

368
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.400
<v Speaker 1>just as he hovered above it,</v>

369
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.500
<v Speaker 1>the sting ray thrust up its tail and it's began starting upwards.</v>

370
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.550
<v Speaker 1>A Barb was shot directly and to Steve's chest,</v>

371
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.300
<v Speaker 1>immediately pulled it out and rose to the top and struggled to get back into the</v>

372
00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:21.840
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

373
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.290
<v Speaker 1>The crew administered CPR and then rushed him to the nearest hospital that he</v>

374
00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:26.800
<v Speaker 1>was announced dead on arrival.</v>

375
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Steve's legacy lives on through his wife,</v>

376
00:16:28.831 --> 00:16:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Terry and just children Bindi and Robert.</v>

377
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.370
<v Speaker 1>These three wildlife warriors continue to run Australia Zoo and to honor the</v>

378
00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:37.890
