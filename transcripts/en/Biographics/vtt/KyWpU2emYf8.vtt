<v Speaker 1>Totally deaf,</v>

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.340
<v Speaker 1>religious founds,</v>

3
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>a Scifi innovative military heroin.</v>

4
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of question marks when it comes to l dot Ron Hubbard's life,</v>

5
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>the life story he is told over the years and the life story that many of his</v>

6
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>fellow is point to is not the same story that documents and other official</v>

7
00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>sources tell the details of his life or uncertain.</v>

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>There is no question that his life was a fascinating trip from a midwestern</v>

9
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>childhood to an internationally recognized right on and influence that</v>

10
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>the man who rose to influence some of Hollywood's biggest names was born far</v>

11
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>from the lands of Celebrity Hubbard was born in 1911 in Nebraska.</v>

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>His mother was a teacher and his father was a military man when Hubbard was only</v>

13
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:52.741
<v Speaker 1>to his family,</v>

14
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>moved from Nebraska to Montana,</v>

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>and Hubbard grew up in a townhouse that we as made claims that the family lived</v>

16
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>on a ranch,</v>

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's just one of many claims that has been debunked by family members,</v>

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>government officials,</v>

19
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and others who actually knew Hubbard as he was growing up and starting his</v>

20
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

21
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] father was in the navy,</v>

22
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>been traveled around the world,</v>

23
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>but Hubbard didn't accompany him outside of the country.</v>

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Some stories about hubbards teen life do suggest that he lived in places like</v>

25
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>China and Guam and Japan,</v>

26
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not clear if this is in fact part of his official life or part of the</v>

27
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>mystique built up around him and the study of eastern medicine as part of his</v>

28
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>scientology persona.</v>

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Truly separating fact from fiction is difficult when it comes to Hubbard's life.</v>

30
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>The Hubbard family briefly lived in Washington state and Hubbard attended school</v>

31
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>for some years on the west coast,</v>

32
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>then return to Montana as a finished high school and live with his grandparents</v>

33
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>and his parents lived overseas.</v>

34
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>After graduating from high school,</v>

35
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I left the Midwest and headed east to the nation's capital at George Washington</v>

36
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.881
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

37
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>He studied engineering but dropped out after only two years due to failing</v>

38
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>grades without a college degree and no prospects ahead of him.</v>

39
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>He turned to his imagination and his began penning Saifai and horror stories to</v>

40
00:01:59.071 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>earn a living.</v>

41
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>He was only making a penny a word,</v>

42
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>though meant you had to write prolifically in order to earn enough to live on.</v>

43
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't get rich writing science fiction if you want to get rich,</v>

44
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you start a religion.</v>

45
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard one said this as well.</v>

46
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>He certainly knew what he was talking about because he had to crank out so many</v>

47
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

48
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard now holds the Guinness World Record for the most translated and</v>

49
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>published author in the world.</v>

50
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>During the 19 thirties,</v>

51
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>he wrote under several pseudonyms and wrote dozens of stories across nearly</v>

52
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>every literary genre.</v>

53
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>He published novels and some reports even say that he wrote as many as 100,000</v>

54
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>words a month.</v>

55
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Science fiction became what he was best known for.</v>

56
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Anti even moved in the social circles of men like Isaac Asimov and Robert</v>

57
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Heinlein,</v>

58
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.141
<v Speaker 1>hubbards racing.</v>

59
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>It also caught the attention of Hollywood.</v>

60
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>He wrote the script for the secret of treasure islands and claims that he helped</v>

61
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>write several other movies,</v>

62
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>including John Ford stagecoach,</v>

63
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>but his name doesn't actually appear in the credits for this movie.</v>

64
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>In the year 2000.</v>

65
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>His work was prominently featured on the big screen when his novel battlefield</v>

66
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Earth was made into a movie starring none other than devout scientologist.</v>

67
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>John Travolta,</v>

68
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>right writing Korea like so many other American men's careers was interrupted by</v>

69
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>the outbreak of World War Two.</v>

70
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>He joined the navy reserve in 1941.</v>

71
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Ends upon the recommendation of his congressman.</v>

72
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>He was made a lieutenants.</v>

73
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>The stories of hubbards military career have been polished and exaggerated for</v>

74
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of scientology.</v>

75
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Tales of overseas heroism abounds hands.</v>

76
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>The scientology version of his war record has been receiving 21 metals for his</v>

77
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>actions during the war,</v>

78
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.660
<v Speaker 1>including injuries that supposedly left him blind.</v>

79
00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>It cripples in reality,</v>

80
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>though the story of hubbards military service is a little bit different.</v>

81
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Official military records show that he never actually left the continental</v>

82
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>United States during the war,</v>

83
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>and he also wasn't a hero far from his.</v>

84
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

85
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>he lost the command of his ship after a number of mishaps,</v>

86
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>including having his crew fire bought what he thought was a submarine off the</v>

87
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>coast of Oregon.</v>

88
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:03:59.111 --> 00:03:59.944
<v Speaker 1>there's submarine.</v>

90
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>It actually turned out to be a large floating log,</v>

91
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>even though Hubbard was relieved of his command,</v>

92
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>he was allowed to stay in the navy on inactive duty.</v>

93
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It was in 1958.</v>

94
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He officially resigned his commission and left the military behind for good.</v>

95
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's active students in the navy where Nice stayed on the west coast moving</v>

96
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>to Los Angeles in 1945.</v>

97
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't been married in 1933,</v>

98
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but his wife wouldn't bring along the whole family to California from Washington</v>

99
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.184
<v Speaker 1>to live there.</v>

100
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Later Habits said his wife left him because he was a cripple.</v>

101
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I was abandoned by family and friends as a supposedly hopeless crippled mandate.</v>

102
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Probable burden upon them for the rest of my days is how his version of the</v>

103
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>stories of those ugly goes in California without his wife or children.</v>

104
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard found himself with a new family of sorts and unless the Crowley,</v>

105
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>that famous practitioner of magic was leading a group and some would say a cult</v>

106
00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.681
<v Speaker 1>called auto,</v>

107
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>temporally or orientalist.</v>

108
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard's joined the group and found an outlet for his interest in science</v>

109
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

110
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>The occult and the fantastical.</v>

111
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>How moved in with Jack Parsons and his girlfriend Sarah Parsons,</v>

112
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>or some members of the group and the three,</v>

113
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>they became close friends perhaps to close because eventually hubbards began</v>

114
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.800
<v Speaker 1>sleeping with Parsons girlfriends and Parsons didn't seem to mind seeing them.</v>

115
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Another female Marjorie Cameron joined the group and started sleeping with her,</v>

116
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but their sexual encounters had an occult end goal.</v>

117
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to impregnate cameron with the spawn of Satan.</v>

118
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Apparently this required Hubbard.</v>

119
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch the couple while they engaged in intercourse,</v>

120
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>their behavior,</v>

121
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I've been surprisingly never resulted in the spawn of Satan,</v>

122
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but these exploits did end in a lasting relationship between Hubbard and</v>

123
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:43.534
<v Speaker 1>northrop.</v>

124
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>The couple were married in 1946,</v>

125
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but Hubbard hadn't yet divorced his first wife.</v>

126
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>It took a year for his first wife to find out that he had married again,</v>

127
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 1>making Hubbard a big interest for an entire year.</v>

128
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>The divorce filings do not paint a pretty picture.</v>

129
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Hubbards first marriage among the accusations included in the papers is that</v>

130
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>systematic torture beatings that strangulations and scientific torture</v>

131
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.744
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

132
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>among the things hubbards first wife was subjected to wants divorce stands,</v>

134
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:10.641
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

135
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>monogamous harbored a northrop,</v>

136
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>moved to Laguna Beach,</v>

137
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.710
<v Speaker 1>then to Georgia,</v>

138
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>and they finally settled in New Jersey.</v>

139
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>It was that,</v>

140
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but he began the crafting the work that served as the basis for scientology</v>

141
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.630
<v Speaker 1>on May the fifth,</v>

142
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.991
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

143
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:34.990
<v Speaker 1>50 that work,</v>

144
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was introduced to the world.</v>

145
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.130
<v Speaker 1>The publication of dianetics,</v>

146
00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.720
<v Speaker 1>the modern science of mental health,</v>

147
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.990
<v Speaker 1>brought hubbards ideas about psychology to the masses.</v>

148
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.921
<v Speaker 1>Within months.</v>

149
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:47.730
<v Speaker 1>The book was selling at a rate of thousands a week and it was translated into</v>

150
00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:48.900
<v Speaker 1>several languages,</v>

151
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>essentially dianetics stores and that,</v>

152
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:50.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

153
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>memories which Hubbard referred to as end grams are the reason that people</v>

154
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 1>experienced psychological pain and its associated health problems.</v>

155
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.890
<v Speaker 1>In the book,</v>

156
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.970
<v Speaker 1>he described how people can release their in grams and work towards becoming</v>

157
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.810
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

158
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the term he used for being cured of all the ills caused by an grants</v>

159
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.790
<v Speaker 1>even alleged that he cured his own war injuries through the use of dianetics.</v>

160
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.480
<v Speaker 1>And he even said that leukemia was caused by an angry and could be cured through</v>

161
00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>dianetics.</v>

162
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Leukemia is evidently psychosomatic in origin,</v>

163
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 1>and at least eight cases of leukemia had been treated successfully by dianetics.</v>

164
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>After medicine had traditional,</v>

165
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:27.150
<v Speaker 1>they'd given up the source of leukemia,</v>

166
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>has been reported to be an engram containing the phrase,</v>

167
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.850
<v Speaker 1>it turns my blood or water pub as well.</v>

168
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.630
<v Speaker 1>He was one who never understate his achievements and he had no doubts about what</v>

169
00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:39.390
<v Speaker 1>dianetics could mean for the world and for human health.</v>

170
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.800
<v Speaker 1>A milestone for comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his</v>

171
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:48.180
<v Speaker 1>invention of the wheel and the arch well Hubbard was short about his theory of</v>

172
00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:48.931
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

173
00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:52.320
<v Speaker 1>The scientific world wasn't so quick to agree.</v>

174
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>As the book continued to sell and dianetics groups began to pop up around the</v>

175
00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:56.550
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>

176
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Scientists and medical professionals began to speak about their disbelief.</v>

177
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:01.230
<v Speaker 1>In dianetics,</v>

178
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.100
<v Speaker 1>the American Psychological Association Dismiss dianetics as did scientific</v>

179
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:05.850
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

180
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.930
<v Speaker 1>They said that hubbards ideas weren't based in facts and he had nothing but</v>

181
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.280
<v Speaker 1>baseless promises.</v>

182
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.331
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

183
00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:13.860
<v Speaker 1>the teachings of Dianetics,</v>

184
00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.000
<v Speaker 1>they'd kept spreading.</v>

185
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard spends much of 1950 touring the country,</v>

186
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.120
<v Speaker 1>giving lectures on dianetics and conducting seminars.</v>

187
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Dianetics groups sprouting up in large cities and people started sending money</v>

188
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Speaker 1>to the groups wanting to start on the path to becoming clear or wanting to learn</v>

189
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:33.030
<v Speaker 1>how they could help others become clear by being what is called a dianetics</v>

190
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.893
<v Speaker 1>auditor,</v>

191
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's all the traveling and the middle of the theme,</v>

192
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 1>how they couldn't keep his second marriage going in architect keepers finances</v>

193
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:40.290
<v Speaker 1>in line,</v>

194
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 1>he was having an affair with his public relations assistance and dianetics</v>

195
00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:47.430
<v Speaker 1>foundations around the country were floundering only a couple of years after his</v>

196
00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:49.140
<v Speaker 1>book was an astounding success.</v>

197
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.280
<v Speaker 1>L Ron Hubbard was divorced a second time and it wasn't looking like dianetics</v>

198
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>was going to be any sort of long term movement,</v>

199
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.851
<v Speaker 1>but hubbards well,</v>

200
00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>he had astounding charisma and he had a theory that people that easily latched</v>

201
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>onto and wanted to believe in.</v>

202
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>One of the dianetics believers was a millionaire named Don purcell.</v>

203
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't lost faith in Hubbard's ends dianetics zs,</v>

204
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to support the cause so he poured money into a building and the</v>

205
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>brand new foundation for dianetics researching Kansas.</v>

206
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>His support and his ideas,</v>

207
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.840
<v Speaker 1>they were no match for Hubbard after he ends harbored,</v>

208
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>had disagreements about the foundation that organization fell apart and</v>

209
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>ultimately ended up losing its money to cover the depths of other lapsed</v>

210
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>dianetics foundations.</v>

211
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Though the foundation in Kansas didn't work out,</v>

212
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a total loss for Hubbard.</v>

213
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.660
<v Speaker 1>He was able to launch Hubbard College in the states and even met his next</v>

214
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>brilliant that she was only 18 and to move together to Phoenix,</v>

215
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.434
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

216
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 1>During this period,</v>

217
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard took the next leap forward in sharing his ideas about psychology and the</v>

218
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 1>human experience.</v>

219
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 1>He started working on putting his ideas about dianetics into a larger spiritual</v>

220
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>and philosophical frame.</v>

221
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.933
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

222
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.680
<v Speaker 1>it was creating scientology.</v>

223
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 1>In 1954,</v>

224
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>the Church of scientology officially launched.</v>

225
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:02.980
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

226
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Bas with much of scientology's history,</v>

227
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 1>there is dispute about which church was the official start.</v>

228
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Was it the one in California founded by a member or was it hubbards organization</v>

229
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 1>in New Jersey?</v>

230
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:14.941
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

231
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard to put forth the ideas for the structure of the church and it's his name</v>

232
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 1>that will forever be linked with scientology.</v>

233
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

234
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>

235
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>what is scientology?</v>

236
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

237
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>how about described it this way.</v>

238
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Scientology is the study of knowingness.</v>

239
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It increases one's knowingness,</v>

240
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but if a man were totally aware of what was going on around him,</v>

241
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>he would find it relatively simple to handle any outbursts in that and according</v>

242
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 1>to the churches website,</v>

243
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 1>scientology teachings contained answers for nearly everything,</v>

244
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>a human good ones and know contains there in our answers to life's most profound</v>

245
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>mysteries,</v>

246
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>the enigma of existence,</v>

247
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the riddle of death,</v>

248
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 1>the realization of states not even described in earlier literature.</v>

249
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Also from these works come scientology technologies to rear children,</v>

250
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 1>repair families,</v>

251
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>educate,</v>

252
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>organize and provide relief in times of illness or suffering.</v>

253
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 1>By 1956,</v>

254
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>the Church of Scientology,</v>

255
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>it was officially considered a church in the eyes of the government and</v>

256
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>therefore was a tax exempt organization.</v>

257
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard was making money as people joins the church,</v>

258
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 1>bought the materials and spends money to move through the ranks of scientology.</v>

259
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 1>One session with a scientology auditor could cost a person that $300 and of</v>

260
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>course you could not just have one session as you kept working your way up.</v>

261
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Getting closer to being clear,</v>

262
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you have to spend more money to work with auditors and to achieve more within</v>

263
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the church.</v>

264
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>People were spending a lot of money to be a member of scientology and to achieve</v>

265
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 1>what Hubbard had promised them was possible,</v>

266
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 1>but just because scientology was growing and was flushed with cash doesn't mean</v>

267
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it was without its problems.</v>

268
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Government is targeted,</v>

269
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the organization worried about the consequences of scientology on the health of</v>

270
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.090
<v Speaker 1>its members and there was also this growing reputation for intimidation among</v>

271
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>scientologists.</v>

272
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>The Australian government even went so far as to say that scientology was a</v>

273
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>serious threat to the community medically,</v>

274
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 1>morally and socially,</v>

275
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's adherence,</v>

276
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>sadly diluted and often mentally ill.</v>

277
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>The United States government was also concerned.</v>

278
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

279
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 1>they had been watching Hubbard for years.</v>

280
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Some reports even say that the FBI had interviewed him as early as 1951 and was</v>

281
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 1>not happy with his mental state.</v>

282
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>In 1963,</v>

283
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 1>the Washington DC scientology church was raided by the feds,</v>

284
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>discovered just how much hubbard was making off the church.</v>

285
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>He was taking millions out of the coffers of this organization and paying no</v>

286
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:26.670
<v Speaker 1>taxes to the government.</v>

287
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 1>It was this the cause scientology to lose its tax exempt status.</v>

288
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Public wasn't willing to let this treatment by the US government stand,</v>

289
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>though he created a new office within scientology to deal with negative</v>

290
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.164
<v Speaker 1>publicity.</v>

291
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>The scientologists in charge of this office took aim aggressively.</v>

292
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Liberty accusing Scientology's,</v>

293
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>detractors of libel and slander.</v>

294
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Others wanted to bring down his attack is and was willing to do whatever it took</v>

295
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.943
<v Speaker 1>to do so.</v>

296
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Lower red blood sex crime,</v>

297
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>actual evidence,</v>

298
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.251
<v Speaker 1>and it's what he wanted.</v>

299
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:57.240
<v Speaker 1>His publicity office defines on those who were attacking scientology's</v>

300
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>reputation.</v>

301
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Even with an aggressive publicity approach.</v>

302
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>A scientology didn't get their tax exempt status back for another 30 years.</v>

303
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>As a judge came under attack from governments.</v>

304
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard saw a solution on the open seas where governments couldn't get in.</v>

305
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It was this that caused him to dream up another organization.</v>

306
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>This one known as sea org.</v>

307
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.490
<v Speaker 1>The sea org was basically scientology on the ocean with its members living</v>

308
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>

309
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Three ships that Hubbard had purchased.</v>

310
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.590
<v Speaker 1>There was a major cash though to be welcomed into the sea org.</v>

311
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to sign a contract saying that you would be loyal to scientology for 1</v>

312
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.320
<v Speaker 1>billion years.</v>

313
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Even though the group was based aboard ships,</v>

314
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 1>they still faced resistance from governments.</v>

315
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>The Greek government asked them to leave Corfu after a year and there's Morocco</v>

316
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 1>was no more welcoming to them being part of the sea org and selling around the</v>

317
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 1>world was not against to being on a cruise ship.</v>

318
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

319
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.121
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

320
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>there was little food,</v>

321
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 1>long hours for those tending to the ship and dirty clothes and linens were the</v>

322
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:48.420
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>

323
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I would himself only lasted on the open sea for a few years.</v>

324
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.070
<v Speaker 1>You have taken breaks on land in the early 19 seventies,</v>

325
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but in 1975,</v>

326
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 1>he returned to life on land for good.</v>

327
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Upon his return,</v>

328
00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>he settled in California and after two decades in the spotlight,</v>

329
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 1>l Ron Hubbard began to fade away from his charismatic leadership role in the</v>

330
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:06.784
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

331
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.280
<v Speaker 1>The is on the ocean and not a raised scientology's.</v>

332
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Problems with the government's Hubbard and his organization were being chased by</v>

333
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:25.030
<v Speaker 1>French and US authorities.</v>

334
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>And didn't even manage to get themselves embroiled in Morocco and political</v>

335
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:28.571
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

336
00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 1>While they're sea org ships would dock that solution to these problems,</v>

337
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 1>wants to keep themselves hidden.</v>

338
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.520
<v Speaker 1>The church kept fighting with Hubbard pulling the strings and directing</v>

339
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 1>operations that went to elaborate lengths to infiltrate the federal governments</v>

340
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>and disrupting investigations.</v>

341
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>One operation called Snow White involved everything from breaking into irs</v>

342
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>offices to bugging the federal governments to even infiltrating government staff</v>

343
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 1>with scientology.</v>

344
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>You could report back to the church.</v>

345
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>A former scientologist said that Hubbard always said,</v>

346
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.503
<v Speaker 1>never defends,</v>

347
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>always attack.</v>

348
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.100
<v Speaker 1>This was gospel and that's pretty much what the church did and it landed.</v>

349
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 1>11 people in jail,</v>

350
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.680
<v Speaker 1>including hubbards wife.</v>

351
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.100
<v Speaker 1>As all of this was going on,</v>

352
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I was still hiding out at home.</v>

353
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 1>He suffered from a number of health problems throughout the 19 seventies and 19</v>

354
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

355
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 1>a heart attack.</v>

356
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Pulmonary embolism,</v>

357
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.610
<v Speaker 1>injuries sustained in a motorcycle,</v>

358
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>accidents and more.</v>

359
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.870
<v Speaker 1>He was obese and he smoked constantly.</v>

360
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>The man simply wasn't healthy.</v>

361
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.240
<v Speaker 1>He moved around trying to stay out of the public eye and away from potential</v>

362
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>government action against him.</v>

363
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>He had a team of teenagers who took care of him,</v>

364
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 1>washing his clothes and holding out ashtrays for his ever present cigarettes by</v>

365
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 1>1996.</v>

366
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 1>His health issues that mounted to a point where they couldn't be overcome at the</v>

367
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 1>age of 74,</v>

368
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>l Ron Hubbard passed away after suffering a stroke when he died.</v>

369
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.560
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't made a public appearance in six years.</v>

370
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times said mystery surrounding his death just as a cloak to the</v>

371
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.073
<v Speaker 1>final years of his life.</v>

372
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 1>He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea by scientologists.</v>

373
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Seven years after Hubbard's death in 1993,</v>

374
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 1>the irs reinstated the church is tax exempt status.</v>

375
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>The irs has not given an explanation about why it was granted again,</v>

376
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.420
<v Speaker 1>but the scientologists good celebrate then nearly $8,000,000,000 in assets.</v>

377
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:08.190
<v Speaker 1>We're once again safe from taxation l Ron Hubbard's.</v>

378
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Life is fraught with contradictions between church teachings and official</v>

379
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 1>government documents,</v>

380
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 1>and he's certainly a controversial figure.</v>

381
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 1>A California judge ruling on a scientology lawsuit didn't hide his feelings</v>

382
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 1>about Hubbard at all.</v>

383
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 1>The evidence portrays is a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when</v>

384
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:25.730
<v Speaker 1>it comes to his history,</v>

385
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds and achievements.</v>

386
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.251
<v Speaker 1>He had egotism,</v>

387
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 1>greed,</v>

388
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.121
<v Speaker 1>avarice,</v>

389
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>lust for power and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against a person's</v>

390
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 1>perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile.</v>

391
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Hubbard was a midwestern boy with an imagination and that aptitude for language</v>

392
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't fare well at George Washington University.</v>

393
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.010
<v Speaker 1>He was able to use this charisma and considerable aptitude for propaganda to</v>

394
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>build an organization that remains largely intact today.</v>

395
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's attracted the likes of Tom Cruise and other Hollywood luminaries to Ed's</v>

396
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:53.150
<v Speaker 1>ranks,</v>

397
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and although it takes hits after,</v>

398
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:55.754
<v Speaker 1>hits in the press,</v>

399
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>scientology marches on and l Ron Hubbard has a legacy that lives on</v>

400
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>

401
00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 1>though it may be so.</v>
