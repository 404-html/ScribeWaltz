00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.030
What comes to mind when you hear the words Napoleon Bonaparte,

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.470
emperor of France weighing us against a certain batik corporal in a big horn
hat,

3
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:11.520
raring up,
majestically on a horse and he conquers half of Europe.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.830
But what if we told you there was another emperor,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.480
Napoleon Bonaparte or Bonaparte who not only managed to rule France for longer

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:23.460
than his famous predecessor,
but basically created modern Paris?

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.670
Well,
today you're gonna meet that man,
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.920
a Napoleon the third,

9
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.130
he was the actual nephew of Napoleon as a child.

10
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:36.300
He was forced to watch the French empire collapse and CS family driven into

11
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.430
hiding as an adult.

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440
He single handedly returns the empire from ruin and then ruled it for 22 years.

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.210
He's the man who created modern Paris,

14
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.400
the politician who made France great again,

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.200
and the general who led his nation into a ruinous wall.
Napoleon the third.

16
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:56.430
He was certainly all of these things and many more.
And in the video today,

17
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.910
the story of history is forgotten Bonaparte.

18
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.213
<v 1>Okay?</v>

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.060
<v 0>On march the 20th 1811 Canon's boomed out across Paris.</v>

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.350
Revelers gathered outside the Twitter is Paris.
It was official and burned.

21
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:22.680
Napoleon had a son had he been old enough to understand the news.

22
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.050
Three year old Shaw,

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.740
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte may have felt sadness born on April the 20th 18 or age.

24
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.260
The boy was the youngest son of Louis Bonaparte,

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
brother of the emperor and Queen Hortense of Hollins.
He,

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.580
just to gross you out a little was also Louis Bonaparte's.
Nice.

27
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.200
More important than his parents.

28
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.890
Creepy relationship though was the Louis Napoleon was a potential adds to the

29
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.360
imperial crown along with his older brother,
Napoleon Louie and no,

30
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:51.900
I didn't screw that up and do eat a polio and the star of our story had an older

31
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:53.490
brother called Napoleon Louie.

32
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.220
Apparently they thought there just weren't enough French guys running around

33
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:59.220
with the name Napoleon.
That's pretty good.
Well,

34
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:03.090
maybe we should just say that he had been an APP prior to that March date in

35
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:07.560
1811 and burned Napoleon.
He had no legitimate son to inherit the crown.

36
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.640
Now though he no longer had any need for his nephews.
This was tragic.

37
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:15.150
Not just from the perspective of Louis Napoleon not being emperor,

38
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.230
but also because producing new burner upon was the only reason his parents were

39
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.080
married.
Louie and Hortense,

40
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.590
they totally hated one another by easy in 10 v he couldn't even live in the same

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.030
country.
Ends are taken the boys to Paris.
While Louie remains in Hollins,

42
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.470
not the young Louis.
Napoleon saw much of his famous uncle in the French capital,

43
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.570
no longer a likely heir.

44
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.810
He spent the early 1810 simply hanging around waiting for his newborn cousin to

45
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.960
support him as the future emperor and for that to happen,

46
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.610
he did not have to wait very long.

47
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.250
And 1812 emperor Napoleon made the really stupid mistake of invading Russia

48
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.620
belly.
18 months later,
the French amber,

49
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.660
it was in ruins and Paris was under allied occupation realizing that the Jig was

50
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.650
up and desperate to save his dynasty.

51
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.580
Napoleon applicators and made his three year old son,
Emperor Napoleon.

52
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:08.140
The seconds on April the fourth 1814 but it was at this point that the occupying

53
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.130
allies were pretty much like that's not happening and forced the entire

54
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.820
Bonaparte Line to abrogate two days later on April the sixth before handing

55
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.770
young Napoleon the second over to Austria.

56
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.140
If you started this video thinking Napoleon the third,

57
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.200
what about Napoleon the second?
Where did he go?
Well,
he went to Austria.

58
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.500
That's white.
This not really a video about him.
In the aftermath of Waterloo,

59
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.910
the entire Bonaparte clan,

60
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.760
it was forced into exile Louis Napoleon and his family,

61
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.840
they resettled in Switzerland's where they could do nothing but watch is France,

62
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.450
abolished it empire and restored the monarchy.

63
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.070
It could have been a crushing psychological blow if it were not for queen hot

64
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.890
audience.
From the moment they reached neck.

65
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:47.320
Sal wholetones started grooming Louis Napoleon and his brother do become future

66
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:50.080
emperors.
Now,
this was an absurd thing to do,

67
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.020
but it would also turn out to totally be the right move.

68
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.740
On May the fifth 1821 the podium Bonaparte died in exile on center Lena back in

69
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.010
Europe.
The news made all the great powers,

70
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.050
suddenly super nervous about a young Napoleon.

71
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.800
The second so worried where they about this child prisoner taking his father's

72
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.440
mental that they completely overlooked.
Louis Napoleon,

73
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.000
no one noticed is he and his brother moved to Italy papal states in 1826 no one

74
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.330
noticed as they joined the carbon armory lodge and started training and

75
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.510
revolutionary warfare like an audience watching a magic trick.

76
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.260
Europe's great powers were too busy looking the wrong Napoleon.

77
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.220
By the time they realized their mistake,
it was too late.
On July the 20 seconds,

78
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:28.600
1832 Napoleon,

79
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.160
the second course in pneumonia in Austria and he died at age 21 when the news

80
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.290
hit all surviving members of the burner part line,

81
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.320
we're quick to renounce their claims to the imperial crown.

82
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.670
That was with one exception the year before in 1831 Louis Napoleon's older

83
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:47.270
brother Napoleon Louie had been carried off by an outbreak of measles that's

84
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.970
men's that the chance to become Napoleon.

85
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.610
The third it passed straight to Louis Napoleon.

86
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.640
His mother's prediction had come absolutely true,

87
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.670
and he was the ad to the French and pot.

88
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.980
So here's the thing about suddenly declaring yourself emperor of France,

89
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:10.400
it doesn't actually make you emperor of France.
Trust me,

90
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.760
I've tried that is not to say that Louis Napoleon's claim,

91
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:16.010
I'm like mine was not totally empty.

92
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.420
There was still a large contingency over burnt up artists in France looking to

93
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.530
revive the empire for itself.
It was also unstable in July,

94
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.880
1830 the three glorious days.

95
00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:30.050
It topples the restored borbons and put to the July monarchy on the throne.

96
00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:31.760
While June,

97
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.570
1832 had seen another attempted revolution against the July monarchy.

98
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.130
This Diane involving a lot more show tunes.

99
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.630
It wasn't hard to imagine that for some charismatic leader with a Buddha part

100
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:48.800
name,
rallying the people of France to his side and overthrowing the government.

101
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.480
Sadly though Louis Napoleon was not that man.
You Seen Napoleon the third.

102
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:54.680
He was a weird looking guy.

103
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.030
I remember his entourage once described him as a man with a long fat phase,

104
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.720
broad shoulders,
a fast torso,
in a very short legs.

105
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.460
He walked slowly with his feet pointing out and his body tilted to the left
side.

106
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.380
He was also puffed up.
He was pompous.

107
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:12.650
He was pregnancy prancing around in military regalia,

108
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.050
although he was said to be charming and private.

109
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.520
Europe at large regarded Louis Napoleon is something of a clown and the thing is

110
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.540
here,
he kind of was a clown.
Take this draws book queue as an example,

111
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.050
but our type of the Fed 1836 and leaving Napoleon trying to seize control of the

112
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:31.400
France by walking into a military garrison and Strasbourg and rallying the men

113
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:35.000
too is cause instead the garrison commander that had all of the music is

114
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:37.970
arrested and Louis Napoleon was deported to America.

115
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.920
Not that the exile lasted very long.
They,

116
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.300
in August of 1837 queen Hortense felt seriously ill.

117
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.930
Louis Napoleon caught the first bus back to Europe to be a test side when she

118
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:52.250
passed away on October the fifth rather than return to America in the way of his

119
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.700
mother's death.
Let me to podium instead went to London.

120
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.970
It was wild in the British capital that he cooked on boneheaded coup attempts

121
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.940
numero do by asking 14th of July monarchy.

122
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.520
It was unpopular looking to prop up and support King Louie.

123
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:08.630
Felipe arranged have Napoleon Bonaparte's remains reinserted in Paris's lizard

124
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.230
or lead across the channel.
Louis Napoleon mystic,

125
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:15.380
the celebrations for a sign that the French were crying out for another emperor

126
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.070
Bonaparte.

127
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.690
So on August the fifth 1840 rounds it up the gang of 56 mesenteries and staged a

128
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.170
lending billowing somewhere.
The plan was that the site of Louis Bonaparte,

129
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.390
which inspire the population of France to revolt and overthrow the July

130
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:33.950
Manicheans then hoist Louis Napoleon up onto their shoulders and declare him

131
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:38.420
emperor of the French Banstead.
The MRO was once again promptly arrested.

132
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.600
The coup of 1840 was so flagrantly and competence that it probably saved Louie

133
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.780
Napoleon's life.
Leisure,
nor did abouts wrote one doesn't kill a crazy people.

134
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.210
One just locks them up.
There's only [inaudible].
Well,

135
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:51.800
they agreed rather than death.

136
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:56.650
Louis Napoleon was condemned to life imprisonment in harm,
fortress,
narrow arms.

137
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.200
Despite his insurrection.
Repas Louie Napoleon's imprisonments.

138
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.310
It was actually kind of comfortable yet a large library and was allowed to read

139
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.450
and write at his leisure.

140
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.360
He wound up learning so much that he took to calling the prison,

141
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.480
the University of arm even managed to write and publish a book.

142
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:15.920
The extinction of poverty,
which was almost Marxist in its treatment of the poor.

143
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.550
The book became a surprise bestseller in France since earns Louis Napoleon a

144
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.210
strong base of support amongst the workers by 1846 they are living.

145
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.090
Napoleon had grown tired of um,

146
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:28.500
university on May the 25th he escapes by dressing as a Labor,

147
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:32.340
errands simply walking out the door.
He,
it resurfaced in London a few days.

148
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.270
Nature urines went back to his impotent Ku plussing.

149
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.220
By now the self proclaimed and Napoleon the third was almost 40 and says nothing

150
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.050
but two failed coups to his name.

151
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.160
It would take a spectacular turnarounds for doing a pony and to fulfill his

152
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.960
mother's dreams and become emperor.

153
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.150
The entire social order of France would have to be exploded like a volcano just

154
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.040
erupted underneath this little.

155
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.170
Anyone realize this as the 1840 is drew to a close a volcano was exactly what

156
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.950
France was sitting on.

157
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.083
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.270
<v 0>How back in 1830 the July Monique,</v>

159
00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:13.150
he came to power in France on the back of a revolution.
Well,

160
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.190
in 1848 it exited Z in exactly the same way.

161
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.840
On February the 22nd 1848 in governments or ban on people meeting for banquets

162
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.170
somehow span off into violent street protests.

163
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.330
This intern somehow led to King Louie for lead,

164
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:31.500
abdicating the monarchy being abolished and the second French Republic being

165
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:32.250
declared.

166
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.720
That happens on February the 26th this was the moment Louis Napoleon had been

167
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:37.380
dreaming off,

168
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.220
not two days later on February the 2080 arrived in Paris and offered the

169
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:45.150
revolutionary provincial government is help and recurring theme there.

170
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.420
The provisional government said to properly back into exile.
Yeah,

171
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.830
France might have revolted,

172
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:53.220
but it was not a revolt aimed at putting a Bonaparte Baggins of power.

173
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.530
The New Republican government,
they wanted liberal reform,

174
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:58.710
not some bumbling clown pretending to be as famous uncle,

175
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.250
but living Napoleon was as stupid as his enemies.
Thought back in England,

176
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.860
he settled down to watch events unfolds,

177
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:08.850
just biding his time and he didn't have to buy it as time for very long.

178
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.580
On June the 23rd 1848 the work is a Paris revolted against the provisional

179
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.020
government's who felt that they had betrayed the revolution.

180
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.320
The results was the June days,
a three day massacre,

181
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:24.120
which soul 1,500 Parisians being killed when he was that the second republic,

182
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.430
it's still stood to bid.
Those connected to as well.

183
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.420
Now even less popular than the July Monica had been.
Now all of this,

184
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.920
if at Louis Napoleon in an excellent position on September the 17th to the 18th

185
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:38.820
1848 France held elections for the constituent assembly.

186
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.990
Louis Napoleon got on the tickets in one five departments and with that the

187
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.740
assembly was forced to lift his exile.
Now legally back in France,

188
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:50.430
Louis Napoleon began campaigning and agentic Lee for the upcoming presidential

189
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:51.030
elections.

190
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.210
He ran his announcement of the populous promising extinction of pauperism to the

191
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:55.490
poor military discipline,

192
00:10:55.491 --> 00:10:59.570
to the burner POTUS and to presidents untainted by the June days to everyone

193
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.060
else.

194
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.580
The results on December the 10th 1848 where a landslide Louis Napoleon Ramat

195
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.510
home with 74% of the vote,
the elites,
they will have to gasping in his dust.

196
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.300
This clown was now precedent.
Still.

197
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.020
His opponents comforted themselves with the knowledge that the new constitution

198
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.790
only allowed presidents one four year term by 1842 president Louis Napoleon,

199
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.010
it'd be gone.
I mean,
after all,

200
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:27.390
it's not like he had a habit of launching coups or anything like that,
right?

201
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.020
Let me Napoleon's motivations though they revealed themselves slowly.

202
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.500
The self styled prince presidents at first worked with a national assembly

203
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.340
supporting populist moves like sending the military to Rome to protect the pope

204
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:39.720
from revolutionaries.
In fact,

205
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:43.650
things went so slowly that nobody even seemed to notice the way that Louis

206
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.650
Napoleon was stuffing all the key posts in governments and the army with

207
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:50.370
loyalists,
kind of just like someone plotting a coup might do.

208
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.190
In 1851 Louis Napoleon finally came into the,
with his ambitions,

209
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.450
they asked the National Assembly to a men's,

210
00:11:56.451 --> 00:11:59.320
the constitution to let him run again.
They said no.

211
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.680
So the prince presidents when they got rid of them December.

212
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.150
The second is a special day for Bonaparte Lists.

213
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.410
It's the day that the Polian was coronated in 1804 it's also the day that he

214
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:12.700
defeated the third coalition at the battle of Austerlitz in 1851 it also became

215
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.750
the day that Louis Napoleon finally did a COO,
right?
Overnight,

216
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.180
$30,000 loyalists occupied Paris.

217
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.020
People are woke to posters announcing the national assembly had been dissolved,

218
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.110
although some die hard republicans mans the barricades.

219
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.070
It's simply wasn't enough.
On December the fourth 1851 Paris fell,

220
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.370
President Bonaparte announced the effective dissolution of the second republic

221
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:37.120
then held a referendum just to check that this was cool with everyone and it

222
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:39.370
totally was the one with an enormous margin.

223
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.630
10 months later in November of 1852 he held another referendum on restoring the

224
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:47.740
friend Jen.
Byron's giving himself near unlimited power and yes,

225
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:49.410
he won that too.
I'll just have it.

226
00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:52.300
The second 1852 the first anniversary of his cue,

227
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.180
Louis Napoleon was officially crowns.
Napoleon,

228
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:58.210
the third emperor of the second French and Bob,

229
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.330
this is what the famous column great about history repeating itself actually

230
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:05.170
refers to first as tragedy then as foss,

231
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.020
but what it Louis Napoleon cat it finally done it hit,

232
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:11.380
achieved the impossible dream that his mother had set for him back when they

233
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:14.290
were both living as exiles wells.
It'll laughed at him.

234
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.030
I did one now it was time to show them just how wrong they were.

235
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.810
What does a guy who's been lusting for power for basically his entire life do

236
00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:33.740
when he finally gets it?
In the case of Napoleon the third,
the answer is well,

237
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:38.830
everything that once the period of 1852 to 1860 as known as the authoritarian

238
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.540
empire and it's the period where Napoleon,

239
00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:46.541
the third road like a mad cross between a total deaths bought a liberal Utopian

240
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.780
Mandy kid on a sugar rush or running around trying to do a bazillion things at

241
00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:53.420
once.
His biggest project was Paris,

242
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:56.540
but at the time the city of lights was actually more like the city of horrible

243
00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:59.300
smells and all my God.
What's that floating in the sen?

244
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.010
The French capital was filthy.
Cholera outbreaks were common,

245
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.750
the streets were crowded,
slums.

246
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.500
Everything you probably picture as Paris in your mind today is exactly what the

247
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:14.680
city was,
not in 1850 to one of the Emperor Napoleon.
The third,

248
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:18.870
his first acts was to call architect baron Haussmann into his office and tell

249
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:23.820
him to go forth and it's bringing a light and cleanliness together.
The two men,

250
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:27.390
they roots the Paris street plan of today.
They knocked down slums,
built parks,

251
00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:28.440
improved sanitation,

252
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:33.060
gave every worker at home created the sweeping boulevards that Paris is famous

253
00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:36.870
for those elegant buildings that pop into your head whenever you hit Paris.
Well,

254
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.310
this is when they first appear.
It's also when Paris first gets its nickname.

255
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.690
Holsman installed so many gas streetlights that the capital was christened the

256
00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:48.330
city of lights still Napoleon.
The third is rain.

257
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.430
It wasn't just construction work.
He made education and compulsory.

258
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:55.100
He lifted the ban on women gaining higher education.

259
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:59.780
He instituted public pensions and ushered in agricultural reforms that wipes out

260
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.120
famines in France permanently.
He also,

261
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:05.900
he made the stays invest heavily in railway and steamship building opens lines

262
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:08.180
of guaranteed credits to small business owners.

263
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.500
It was always like a new deal of the 1850s or maybe an old new deal and it

264
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:16.400
totally worked.
By 1870 the economy was growing at 5% a year.
Well,

265
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.200
industrial output had boomed by 75% in short,
the counts sends out,

266
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:22.970
so not ready.
The account at all.

267
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.020
Napoleon the third even managed to grab fronts and choice colonies like New

268
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.090
Caledonia,
equality in 1853 Vietnam,

269
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:34.091
1858 and Cambodia 1863 now we such a neat shouldn't gloss over his authoritarian

270
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:37.700
side while froms boomed economically,
socially,

271
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:39.980
it transformed into a police state.

272
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.640
There was censorship restrictions on association and free speech and there were

273
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:48.020
spies everywhere and then that was the Roth,
a sticky topic of war.

274
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.320
The period from the end of the Napoleonic wars until the rise of the second

275
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:55.640
friend Jen buyer,
it hadn't seen a single conflict between Europe's great powers,

276
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.870
barely was Napoleon.

277
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:01.250
The third is thrown warm from his imperial backside than the Crimean war erupted

278
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:02.780
in 1853 now,

279
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.720
the Crimean war is super complicated and then it would be unfair to blame.

280
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:07.760
It's all on the polio and the third,

281
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.140
but he was itching for a fight and he pressed forward where maybe others would

282
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:15.470
have backed down.
The result was a conflict that killed nearly a million people,

283
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:19.640
but left France and our ally Britain.
You live victorious on the European stage.

284
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.990
This confidence boost,

285
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.510
let's interns and Napoleon the third to getting involved with,

286
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.980
it's an the second war of unification in 1859 given Italian nationalists of

287
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:29.780
trying to assassinate him the year before,

288
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.110
throwing a bomb in his carriage that killed 14 of his entourage.
Yeah,

289
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.850
might've expected Napoleon the third.
Do you fight against unification?
But no,

290
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.640
he sent it the French army to help the Kingdom of Santine Arabia kick the

291
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:43.850
Austrians out of their Italian colonies.
They won that war too,

292
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:48.851
which is why nice and survive currently part of France by 1860 [inaudible] end

293
00:16:49.131 --> 00:16:53.150
was riding high.
The stability and the 30 and reading made France great again.

294
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.190
It also convinced himself that he was a tactical military genius on par with

295
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:02.630
this legendary uncle [inaudible] Mary Countess [inaudible] need to Monte year.

296
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.310
They know what they say about pride.

297
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.960
It always comes before a full end to Louis Napoleon.
He was a legendary fool.

298
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.310
Historians of the seconds,

299
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:20.870
French embark all the period after 1860 the liberal empire.
Why?
Well,

300
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.280
it's the periods when Napoleon,

301
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:26.600
the third pivoted from being a nasty death spot to a slightly more cuddly one.

302
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.870
The transformation came in 1860 to head off a political crisis.

303
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:32.390
Over the huge loans is projects were racking up.

304
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.110
Louis Napoleon offered his Senate new powers and east censorship.

305
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.100
The changes were enough to keep them in power and led to more liberalization

306
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:40.934
down the line.

307
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.970
Yet all this is really just a sideshow to the two major events of 1862 the first

308
00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:48.600
was something of a private problem looming.

309
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.050
Napoleon's rain had been partially held together by his boundless energy,

310
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:57.051
but in 1862 he developed exceedingly painful bladder stones that SAP has energy

311
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.280
left in reliance on those around him.

312
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.110
The second was far more consequential for world history and that was the rise of

313
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.670
Otto von Bismarck.

314
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.730
We've actually got another biographics graphics video in the works about

315
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.970
Bismark's.
I mean,
not going to get too sidetracked with him right here,

316
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.160
but just let me give you a very quick overview.

317
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.530
Bismarck was the minister president of pressure,

318
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:21.210
a geometric country roughly analogous to modern eastern Germany and northern

319
00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:23.580
Poland's with its capital in Berlin.

320
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.510
Bismarck was a firm believer in both the strategic use of warfare as the

321
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:31.290
unification of all the many German statelets into a single Germany.

322
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.100
He was also a political genius.
He didn't take fools lightly,

323
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.980
which was a big problem.
Vore Louis Napoleon,

324
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.480
not that tiny pressure appeared much of a threat to France in 1862 when Bismarck

325
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.440
went to war against the Danes and 80 64 Napoleon the third barely even noticed

326
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.280
in October of 1865 living to podium even promise the iron chancellor,

327
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.110
France wouldn't intervene of pressure went to war with Austria less than a year

328
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.510
later.
These seven weeks war ended with Vienna beaten.

329
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.450
Louis Napoleon actually mediated the piece stalks which oversaw the creation of

330
00:19:01.451 --> 00:19:05.820
the sort of half unified Germany,
the northern German confederation.

331
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.710
This was a problem because it was now clear that this thing called Germany was

332
00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:15.510
becoming extremely big and extremely powerful in a very short space of time,

333
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.770
but Napoleon the third,

334
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.940
he was simply to arrogance or maybe too diluted to realize the threat that

335
00:19:20.941 --> 00:19:21.930
Germany Post.

336
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.410
He still thought that he was the senior partner in the relationship with

337
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:26.070
Bismarck.

338
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.180
It wasn't until Bismarck blocks of the French annexation of Luxembourg by ending

339
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.600
war that Louis Napoleon realized that he was in over his head.

340
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.270
The big trouble was that everyone else realized it too.

341
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.020
When frons backs off on Luxembourg,

342
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.300
Bismarck was able to see just how weak the French empire was.
The French public,

343
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:45.150
they turned on their emperor in the 1869 elections.

344
00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:49.170
The government nearly lost control of the centers by the end of 1869 Napoleon,

345
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:53.130
the third was forced to fully liberalized the empire just to keep power turning

346
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:56.220
it into a kind of constitutional monarchy.
Unfortunately,

347
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:59.520
the changement listening more than ever to what the public ones is and what the

348
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:01.830
public wants.
It was war with pressure

349
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.320
even by the standards of the 19th century.

350
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:14.640
The causes of the Frank Prussian war are ridiculous beyond belief in Spain,

351
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:18.480
Queen Isabella abdicated the throne and depression prints off a takeout place.

352
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.260
France said no and send their ambassador to tell the brush and gang to back off.

353
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.960
The ambassador met the king on a walk,
shouted at him for a minute,

354
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:29.340
and then stormed off and with that begins the Franco Prussian war.
All right,

355
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:32.430
so it was slightly more complicated than that.
In reality,

356
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.530
the real trigger was the ends dispatch,

357
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:37.860
which contains an accounts of the meeting between the king and the ambassador

358
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.460
that was perfectly calibrated to make both sides think that they'd been

359
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:44.160
grievously and salted.
It was edited by Bismark.

360
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:47.800
You by now had decided they quick war with the French would be the perfect

361
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:51.370
bonding exercise to seal German unification and they've got his wish.

362
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.030
On July the 19th 1870 France declared war on pressure.

363
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.430
The French army is 280,000 trips.

364
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:01.120
They were mobilized despite being shockingly ill by this stage.
Napoleon,

365
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:05.010
the third row down to do personally lead the troops,
amusingly his stuff,

366
00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.920
so sure that they'd soon be conquering German territory that they forgot to pack

367
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:10.510
any maps of their own country.

368
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.810
The first engagement it game on August the fourth 1870 and it was a massacre.

369
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.410
The well trained Prussians made mincemeat out of in Napoleon's shambolic army

370
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.950
for two entire days after a staggering restraint.

371
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:27.220
The French fought again on August the 16th and again,

372
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.680
they were wiped out getting desperate.

373
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:32.800
Louis Napoleon tried to summon the spirit of his dead uncle.

374
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.280
He got that all remaining French soldiers for an attack on the Prussian troops.

375
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:37.270
Besieging mets.

376
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.660
This was exactly the sort of foolhardy gamble that his uncle would have made,

377
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:44.770
but the differences is uncle it have pulled it off on the 1st of September,

378
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.770
1870 the French and the Prussians fault,
the battle of sedan,

379
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.520
which could just as well be called the defeat of subtle,
the French,

380
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.810
they were pulverized.

381
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.900
The Prussians managed to and cycle and then capture that entire on a among those

382
00:21:58.061 --> 00:21:59.850
arrested was living Napoleon.

383
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.550
When the news of the emperor's capture reached Paris on September the fourth the

384
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:08.230
government was so outraged it voted then and that to abolish the second friend

385
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.000
Jamba along with its useless emperor Franz immediately became the third
republic.

386
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.020
It wasn't the end of the world.

387
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:16.690
I am drags on it through the grueling siege of Paris,

388
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:19.880
but certainly we need to pay her.
Then it was done living to pay it.

389
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:21.530
It was kept prisoner until the P street.

390
00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:25.270
He was signed and the unification of Germany was declines on January the 18th

391
00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:27.400
1871 finally,
in March,

392
00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:31.900
the now former emperor was released back into exile and England's but has

393
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:36.130
humiliations.
They were not done yet.
In the wake of France is epic defeat.

394
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.240
Paris was seized by a radical revolutionary group that became known as the Paris

395
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:43.660
commune.
They ruled for two months before putting Paris to the torch.

396
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:46.480
When the French army retook the city,
the new Paris,

397
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:50.020
there's Louis Napoleon had spent so long building was simply burned to the

398
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:53.680
ground.
Although it would be ultimately rebuilt to his designs,

399
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.930
it would never live to see us over in England's Louis.

400
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:59.800
Napoleon had settled in the village of Chisel Hurst with his wife and their son,

401
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:01.840
who they still call it the prince and burial.

402
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.450
It was a short and painful retirements looming.

403
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:08.230
Napoleon's health got worse until on January the ninth 1873 he went to the

404
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:11.530
hospital for a last ditch operation to care is bladder stones.

405
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:16.590
He died under the knife at age 65 all of those times it listened to his mother

406
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:19.390
as a young Exxon and dreamed of being emperor.

407
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.540
He could have never imagined that it would end like this.

408
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.320
In 1879 looming up aliens and the prints and perio also died.

409
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.570
Extinguishing their family is line two years later,
his wife,

410
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.820
Janie has both of them re buried and Farnborough pleasantly boring towns,

411
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:36.940
some 30 miles from London.
Although the tomb that holds Napoleon,

412
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:40.150
the third remains a tourist attraction.
It's hardly as if a lead.

413
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.690
So what's in the ends to Louis Napoleon accomplish?
Well,

414
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.420
the road fronds for longer than his uncle did since he undoubtedly oversaw an

415
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:49.790
industrial boom that modernized the French economy.

416
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.200
If founded colonies like New Caledonia,
that's still departments of France today.

417
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:58.040
On z promoted workers and women's rights at a time when it was deeply

418
00:23:58.041 --> 00:23:59.690
unfashionable.
On the other hands,

419
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.310
he took France from a peaceful states back to one of dangerous warfare and paid

420
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.380
a catastrophic Lee high price.

421
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.310
The peace settlements after the Franco Prussian war crippled France all the way

422
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.630
into a world war one.

423
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.870
But perhaps the biggest thing that the other emperor Bonaparte's accomplished

424
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:17.210
was becoming the other ember of Bonaparte's.

425
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.200
This was a man who as a child was bands from his home country,
false,

426
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:25.310
live in exile and derided as a clown,
yet through shit Dawg,

427
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.780
it determination,
he managed to conquer the very system that had locked him out.

428
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.860
If only for a brief time.
Was he a clown?
Was he a tyrant?

429
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:38.750
Was he a visionary leader that down by one disastrous naps in judgements?
Well,

430
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.310
the jury's still out on that one,

431
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.250
but there's one thing we cannot deny Louis Napoleon.

432
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.040
He was and will forever be Napoleon,

433
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:50.000
the third emperor of the French.
