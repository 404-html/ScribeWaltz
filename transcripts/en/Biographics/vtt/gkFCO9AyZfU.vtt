6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.380
Friedrich Nietzsche was a 19th century philosopher who was most remembered for

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.490
his killer quotes and incredibly large mustache.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.040
The main goal of his work was aims to uncover the fact that there is new

9
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:33.660
universal truth and there's the human condition is in a constant state of

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.880
overcoming our animalistic urges.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.960
He came up with many amazing quotes that we still use to this very day,

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.460
including what doesn't kill me,

13
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:46.461
makes me stronger and of course God is dead while he is often misunderstood and

14
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:50.790
his work has been used for the justification of evil over the past hundred
years.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.910
The philosophy of Friedrich Nature truly hasn't changed the way that people in

16
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.300
the 21st century live.
And today in the video we're going to talk about his life,

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.670
his philosophy and his legacy.

18
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.720
Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October the 15th 18 at 44 in Saxony,
Prussia,

19
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.330
which is now a part of modern day Germany.

20
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.290
He just happened to be born on the same day as King Friedrich Ville Helm of the

21
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:23.950
fourth,
which is why his parents decided to name them after their ruler.

22
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.500
He grew up in a very strict Protestant family.

23
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.950
His father was a priest and his grandfather published books defending

24
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:34.300
Lutheranism.
His father contracted and excrutiatingly painful brain disease.

25
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.420
That lasted for a full year before he finally died.

26
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.680
Then in 1949 Friedrichs younger brother Ludovic vague also died when he was only

27
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:44.380
two years old.
By the time you started going to kindergarten,

28
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:47.260
nature had seen so much death and suffering in his young life.

29
00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:49.510
This he was already a very serious person.

30
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.950
He was near sighted and he got constant headaches from a condition called
Myopia.

31
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.530
Therefore,
he started wearing glasses as young trials.

32
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.600
He looks and it's acted like a tiny professor who was following too grown up for

33
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.570
childish games.

34
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.170
Obviously it's going to make it very popular with his classmates since he did

35
00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:09.040
not make many friends.
Most of his childhood was spent surrounded by women,

36
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.540
his mother,

37
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.120
these grands mother rinse to once they all shared in the responsibilities of

38
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:15.370
raising him.
In 1856 Friedrich Nietzsche,

39
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.170
his sister Elizabeth and his mother moved to their own house in [inaudible],

40
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.900
Germany.

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.260
That house would become the place where he would write his most important work

42
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:26.440
and the property has been preserved to day as a museum.

43
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.770
They should have attended a Christian prep school and later transferred to a

44
00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:32.170
boarding school.
He never got particularly good grades,

45
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:34.300
but his father had a state job before he passed away,

46
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.690
which meant that he got a full scholarship to any college of his choice.

47
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.020
Peep chose to study theology and philosophy at Bond University.

48
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.840
He originally wanted to become a priest like his father,

49
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.410
but after just two semesters he realized that his personal beliefs were in

50
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.110
direct conflict with the theological curriculum.

51
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.410
As he often got into arguments with his professors hands who eventually

52
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.650
transferred to the University of Leipzig and d started studying ancient

53
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:00.010
languages like Latin and Greek as student's need trip,

54
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:04.150
contracted syphilis from a prostitute at a brothel which made him physically

55
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.820
weekends in constant pain for the rest of his life.

56
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.270
Syphilis is also known for causing people to fall into madness,

57
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.220
which ultimately did happen to him,

58
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.160
but that's only there was no cure for syphilis today.

59
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:19.720
It's treated with penicillin bus that would not be invented until 1923

60
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.860
significantly after his death and he spends much of his free time listening to

61
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.810
live performances of orchestras and operas.

62
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.470
The music was so beautiful that it helped him to forget about his pain.

63
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.490
He was particularly fascinated by the work of composer Richard Wagner and Nancy

64
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:37.090
would pay you to see each new performance three or four times in a row.

65
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.180
He was completely inspired by the tragedy of the characters in Wagner's operas

66
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.260
and eventually got to meet the composer.

67
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.010
They became very good friends and Richard Wagner was sort of like a father

68
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.990
figure to Neat Jack when he was 24 years old.

69
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:53.680
He worked as a full fulltime professor of languages and the University of Basel.

70
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.520
He taught it for several years even though he claims that he was not all that

71
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.480
happy in the classroom.

72
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.860
He designed to to volunteer his time as an orderly at the hospital after school.

73
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.490
However,
he ended up contracting dysentery and diptheria from the patients.

74
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.010
There's health continued to decline so dramatically there's,

75
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.310
he would sometimes end up bedridden for several days straight.

76
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.970
He decided to retire from being a professor in his thirties and lived on a very

77
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:20.800
modest pension.
Me simply staying alive.
It was a constant battle.

78
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.640
He spent a great deal of time in bed with nothing to do and he was always

79
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.340
thinking about the meaning of life and humanity.

80
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.430
This is when he began to write books on philosophy.

81
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.943
<v 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 0>Friedrich Nietzsche believed that there is no absolute truth and the people</v>

83
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.880
should not have a blind faith in their church or their political leaders.
Today.

84
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.260
This is kind of common sense,

85
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.650
but back in the 18 hundreds people were raised that there were absolute right

86
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.840
and wrong answers and there was nothing in between the wizard.

87
00:04:56.841 --> 00:05:01.841
No gray by telling people to inquire rather than just blindly accept something

88
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.220
he inspired a future.
Generations do completely changed the way that we think.

89
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.390
One of his most famous quotes,
God is dead,
is used by atheists everywhere,

90
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:14.110
but it's actually misunderstood and rather taken out of context.

91
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.560
What he really said was,
God is dead.
Gold remains dead,

92
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.800
and we have killed him.
How should we comfort ourselves?

93
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.750
The murderers of all murderers?
He wasn't celebrating the death of God,

94
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:27.460
though he was making a statement.

95
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:31.330
The more and more people were losing faith all the time and he believed that

96
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.410
without Christianity,

97
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.180
mankind's didn't know how to figure out right and wrong without the existence of

98
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:38.500
religion.
People often looked up,

99
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:42.970
see their political leaders and royal families with a sort of God like
reverence.

100
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.770
He knew that people needed something else to take religions place.

101
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.550
He wants the people to embrace arts like music,
literature,
and theater instead.

102
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.170
Since he said that Shakespeare had just as much value to human morality as the

103
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:59.870
Bible without away people's ability to think for themselves.

104
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.250
He believed that the rules of society were developed to keep people down and to

105
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:07.160
maintain the status quo.
For example,
in Christianity,

106
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.600
it's taught that people should be like Jesus Christ and not have a desire for

107
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.261
material.

108
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.220
Things need should believe that this is only taught to the poor in order to

109
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:18.710
manipulate them to accept their station in life.

110
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.300
If people are taught to feel shame for feeling envious of others and desiring

111
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:23.631
more,

112
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:27.950
they may not try to achieve a higher status and therefore if they're happy with

113
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.381
it last,

114
00:06:28.381 --> 00:06:32.780
they won't cause a revolution against their governments in order to demand more.

115
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.400
Nature tells us to embrace our own selfish desires and that the rules of society

116
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.510
as something that needs to be overcome in order to get to the real truth of our

117
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.020
lives need to believe that every individual passenger should be in the process

118
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:49.670
of Zelle.
Udo ving Dong,
well self overcoming.
If we are envious of someone else,

119
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.210
this is just a sign of what we really need in order to become our true selves.

120
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.940
For example,
if you feel envious of guys who look muscular,

121
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.100
it's a sign that you should go to the gym.

122
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.870
If you're jealous of someone who is rich,

123
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.710
you should find a job that makes more money,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

124
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.210
Everyone has their own dream and if we refuse to acknowledge these desires were

125
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.390
only going to make ourselves miserable men's,

126
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:13.610
even if we fail to achieve these goals,

127
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.750
at least we have the satisfaction of knowing we tried.

128
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.680
Nisha said that if someone has succeeded in overcoming obstacles while also

129
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:26.210
accepting their failures with grace,
they have become an Uber.
Men Shore,
Superman.

130
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.380
He claims that every man should aspire to become like this.

131
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.470
He said the most people that stuck in between that animal instinct sends the rue

132
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:41.990
mentioned.
There is a constant struggle between the two impulses.

133
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.240
He was one of the first people to come up with the concepts.

134
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.010
That ignorance is bliss and then it's easy to be happy as a human if you just

135
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.870
accept the status quo.

136
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.740
He admits that the quest for knowledge and to become the Ubermensch mites make

137
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:58.550
him miserable along the way,
but it was a life that he chose to pursue.

138
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.910
And on the last many people have read of this concept of Uber mentioned,

139
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:06.320
misinterpreted it as to mean the ability to become someone who is superior to

140
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.340
the rest of humanity.

141
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.180
Others like the Nazis would see this as proof that certain races where more

142
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.540
civilized and therefore more human than others.
Now,

143
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:18.530
just before we get into just personal life and his death as well as his legacy,

144
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.950
I don't want to take a moment to thank the people who make this video possible

145
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.170
and that's brilliant.
Now I know midroll lands,

146
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:27.260
they're not great for the video here,
but these videos are long,

147
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:29.090
so I sure hope you appreciate it on a,

148
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:31.190
to have some sponsors in order to make them possible.

149
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:32.780
They're quite expensive to make.
Now,

150
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.230
brilliance a learning platform which teaches three something called active

151
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.040
learning.
Now,

152
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.150
like neat just said we should all question things and the best way to do that is

153
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:44.960
with a solid understanding of the principles of well anything.

154
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.230
And if you want to learn the principles of science and beyond,

155
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:49.910
then that's where brilliant comes in.

156
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.470
I don't know if you've ever sat down with you know,

157
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.500
some scientific textbook and going it,

158
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.560
you're reading it and then you ended up reading the same page six times over and

159
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.200
over again and you still don't really understand what on earth they're going on

160
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:02.610
about.
You're just not taking it in.

161
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.890
Well that's something that we'll passive learning and brilliant.

162
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.510
They're not about that at all.

163
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:08.730
Brilliant solves this problem with active learning.

164
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.830
They give you something super short to read.

165
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.730
It's usually just a few lines and then you immediately apply it to a problem.

166
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:16.440
So you really have to be engaged.

167
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.220
You just rinse and repeat that and suddenly through a few little problems you

168
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:22.800
are understanding stuff that you didn't think you would be.
I've used.

169
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.130
Brilliant and I think you should go try it out just to see how fascinating it is

170
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.170
at how quickly you can grasp a complex subjects you can support biographics.

171
00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:33.900
They're going to brilliant.org forward slash buyer graphics and now let's get

172
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:34.810
back to nature

173
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.830
evenly.
Friedrich Nietzsche is a household name today.

174
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:48.510
His work would not be translated into other languages until the 1890s and by

175
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:51.870
that point he was already too sick to enjoy as new popularity.

176
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.780
So while his philosophy was well known in Germany,

177
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.850
he wasn't exactly it becoming rich and famous.
In fact,

178
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.430
his philosophy made him very unpopular and it ruined his friendship with Richard

179
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.900
Wagner.
Wagner indeed thought that Nisha had gone mad nature.

180
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:09.180
It decided to do isolate himself in the Swiss Alps where he could spend a lot of

181
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:11.850
time in nature.
The often wins on long walks,

182
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:16.620
thinking of nothing but philosophy only to go home and write his ideas down,

183
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:17.670
ready for his next book.

184
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.510
He wrote several volumes of as ideas and sometimes he got letters in the mail

185
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:24.360
from fellow philosophers and people who wanted to be as friends.

186
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.630
He met a psychoanalyst named Lou Andrea Salome when she read niches,

187
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.550
actually felt that his philosophy perfectly aligned with everything.

188
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.910
She had already been thinking.
She was only 20 years old at that time,

189
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.280
but nature considered her to be his protege.

190
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.300
Blue was also trying to challenge the norms of society by experimenting to see

191
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:45.690
if men and women can truly be friends without sex getting in the way of a

192
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:49.770
relationship in 1880 you need you to sign it to go on a year long vacation to

193
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.040
Italy with Lou,
Andrea Salome ans they're mutual friends.

194
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:55.470
Paul ree ree was also a philosopher.

195
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.190
The three friends wanted to buy an old monastery and start an academic commune

196
00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:02.610
together so that they could live in a society there was only filled with other

197
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:04.860
likeminded intellectuals.
Friedrich Nietzsche.

198
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.210
He was excited since he hopes that he could finally have a group of friends who

199
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.020
understood him,
but his family,
they went totally against the idea.
Indeed,

200
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.740
his sister Elizabeth was always writing and letters telling him to stop trying

201
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:17.700
to make a cult.

202
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.270
There was also a bit of a love triangle going on because Friedrich can bull were

203
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:24.240
both in love with Lou and they were competing to win our heart.

204
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.260
Paul proposed to her first but she rejected him saying that she liked him enough

205
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:30.960
for them to live together but more like brother and sister.

206
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.220
She claimed that sex got in the way of thinking clearly and she used each his

207
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:38.400
own philosophy saying that society demands that women get married but she

208
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:41.790
personally wished to remain syllabus and to focus on our academic work.

209
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.040
Even though he agreed to be friends.

210
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:47.280
Friedrich Nietzsche was still only human and the more he got to know her,

211
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:49.380
the more he was falling in love.
After all,

212
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:52.740
blue seem to be the only woman on the planet who completely understood his

213
00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:53.574
life's.

214
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.260
Everybody has a but she put them in the friend zone just like Paul [inaudible]

215
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.330
and had events.

216
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.300
Neesha did have syphilis and marrying him would have meant that she would have

217
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.930
contracted the disease as well,
but she continued to live with him flirting,

218
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:06.160
teasing and leading him on.

219
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.940
He remains hopeful that she would eventually come around and he proposed to her

220
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.930
two more times.

221
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.800
No amounts of intellectual reasoning could overcome his human desire and this

222
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.070
situation.
It became way too uncomfortable for the three of them.

223
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.710
His dream of starting a commune.
It never happens,

224
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:24.910
and Lou and Paul Roadway on their horse drawn carriage leaving Friedrich behind.

225
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.000
It's probably best that he got out of that situation though because she leads a

226
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.780
broke up with Paul Ryan's married a man named Friedrich Collin Dryas.

227
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.230
They apparently remained birth throughout the entire course of their marriage.

228
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.390
She actually did have sexual affairs though,

229
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.970
which is probably just a little bit hypocritical.

230
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.750
She also had an emotional affair with none other than the Sigmund Freud.

231
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.740
It turns out to this,

232
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.790
this was all one big experiment to heart and in 1910 she published a book of

233
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.260
cools,
the erotic wow.

234
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.440
We learned that she spends most of her life trying to analyze and document the

235
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:56.620
differences between men and women when it came to sex.

236
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.850
The relationship with Lou,
Andrea Salami,
completely traumatized.

237
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.980
Friedrich Nietzsche Mans,
he never got married.

238
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.780
He often wrote about love and how we can make the most logical person feel like

239
00:13:12.781 --> 00:13:15.300
they going crazy instead of writing about his own life.

240
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:17.430
Though Beecher expressed his feelings in a book.

241
00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.470
Gold thus spoke Zara through strap.

242
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.520
This is about a man who isolates himself in the mountains and finds all of the

243
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:27.930
wisdom in the world,
but he can't find any disciples to listen to or follow him.

244
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.780
He then becomes the loneliest man in the world.

245
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.640
Since he was rejecting Christianity,

246
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:37.050
Nisha knew that mankind needed some sort of moral compass to live by.
Therefore,

247
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.190
he wrote beyond good and evil and addressed all of the issues of what makes

248
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:43.110
something good or bad.

249
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.190
In 1888 he could feel his mind and his body betraying him.

250
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.940
His last book was called the antichrist where he expressed his trends,

251
00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:52.950
valuation of all values,

252
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.040
where he was trying to come up with a set of rules for morality that could

253
00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:57.120
replace Christianity.

254
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:02.330
He saw himself as a mater who was making a sacrifice for the human race in 1889

255
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.790
he was only 44 years old and he had a nervous breakdown.

256
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.490
He was triggered into hysteria when he was walking in the streets of,

257
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.050
initially he's ordered them beating a horse with a weapons.
He runs the horse.

258
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.700
How could it snack to protect it,
and he was sobbing and saying,
I understand you.

259
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.140
His landlord,
David Fino,

260
00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:22.260
had to usher him out of the streets and get him back to his room.

261
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.710
He spent the next two days laying on a couch in a catatonic state,

262
00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:29.160
so fino arranged for him to get him to Basel in Germany,

263
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.530
even though they'd had a falling out.
Richard Wagner and his wife,

264
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:33.090
they were still history friends.

265
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.270
They were the ones who got him help and he's got him into a mental hospital.

266
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.550
During one of the last moments where he was responsive,

267
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.360
he started to sketch a picture of a man and a woman hugging one another in a

268
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:45.960
long embrace before he slipped into a permanent catatonic state.

269
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.130
It was almost as if he was trying to say that all of his philosophical work was

270
00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:54.650
nothing without to share it with an that at the end of his life love what was

271
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:58.360
the one thing?
This,
he truly wants it more than anything else.
Oh,
the oss,

272
00:14:58.361 --> 00:15:00.620
there's only,
he was diagnosed with paralytic dementia,

273
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:03.710
which was a direct result of his battle with syphilis,

274
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:05.660
which had gone on for over 20 years.

275
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.050
Then many people also believe that the pressure he puts on himself to find the

276
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:13.130
answer to morality without God and to unravel the inner workings of the human

277
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:15.890
condition is what ultimately made him go crazy.

278
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.550
He slips into madness and was unresponsive when people tried to speak to him,

279
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.400
eventually died in the year 1900

280
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.900
so you know,
after his death,
Friedrich Nietzsche,

281
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:34.230
this work was being translated into multiple languages and dip again to inspire

282
00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:35.064
people everywhere.

283
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.490
However many people would read his work and it's completely missing separate

284
00:15:38.491 --> 00:15:41.880
what he was trying to say.
Even his sister Elizabeth,
who was a pseudo,

285
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:44.910
not see late at republished a second edition of his books.

286
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.770
She rewrote certain and sections of his work,

287
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:50.340
so you glorifying the German race as being superior to the rest of the world.

288
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.000
Because of this nature.
Has it been blamed for starting not just one,

289
00:15:54.001 --> 00:15:58.590
but two world wars before world war one even priests were preaching niches,

290
00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:01.800
philosophy at their pulpits,
relating it to their own countries.

291
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.160
This caused a great deal of national pride,
especially in Germany.

292
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.410
I don't fiddler,
he became a fan of nurturance.

293
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.770
He took this as a sign that the Germans were far more evolved than the rest of

294
00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:12.720
the human race during the rise of the Third Reich.

295
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.510
In the 1930s fascists often quoted nature,

296
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.210
especially with his idea of the Uber Manch.

297
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.950
They wanted to make an entire race of superman assist welcomed out of Hitler to

298
00:16:22.951 --> 00:16:26.250
the museum where they pose together for a photograph next to the bus to

299
00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:27.870
Friedrich Nietzsche.
Even today,

300
00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:31.530
many critics of niches work consider his books to be too dangerous for young

301
00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:35.280
people to read.
Since his main philosophy is to question everything.

302
00:16:35.281 --> 00:16:39.420
This can often manifest in acts of rebellion and teenagers.
After all,

303
00:16:39.421 --> 00:16:41.730
if they question that teachers,
parents,
and governments,

304
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:43.960
they are more likely to lash out.
Indeed.

305
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.830
In 1924 this happened in the case of Leopold and Loeb,

306
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.710
they were two college students in Chicago who thought they were smarter than

307
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:53.760
everyone else and that they were the example of the Uber Manch that nature was

308
00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:56.940
writing about.
They believe that they could commit the perfect crime,

309
00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:59.040
so they murdered a 14 year old boy.

310
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.730
That defense lawyer at science in nature is the reason why they committed the

311
00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.200
murder.
And yes,

312
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.130
it's a ridiculous excuse because plenty of people read nature and they don't

313
00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:10.200
become serial killers,
but the jury,

314
00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:13.530
they bought it and those two young men got away with murder because the jury

315
00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:17.990
considered nitrous philosophy to be just that dangerous dislike.

316
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.833
Just criticisms.

317
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:23.790
Civilization of the 20th and 21st century has been completely changed by nitrous

318
00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:27.090
teachings and did they continue to change things to this very day.

319
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.750
Now it's very normal to think critically and question the world around us and

320
00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:33.090
it's often the basis of a liberal arts education.

321
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.670
As for those of us who do not go to church,

322
00:17:35.671 --> 00:17:40.050
we tend to learn about right and wrong from what we see on TV and in the movies,

323
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.520
whether we realize it or not,
we are living in a very niche or ask wells.

324
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.310
It's just a shame that he didn't live to see it.

325
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.590
