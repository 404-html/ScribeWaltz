1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Undoubtedly one of the modern history's most notorious and abhorrent his crimes</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that the stuff of nightmares over the course of 13 years,</v>

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>he prowls for men and load them back to his house before drugging them and</v>

4
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.871
<v Speaker 1>strangling them and all you took the lives of 17 men between 1978 and 1991,</v>

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>but simply killing his victims wasn't enough for Jeffrey Dahmer.</v>

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>He never wanted them to leave,</v>

7
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>so he saved several trophies,</v>

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>including severed heads.</v>

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Eventually even eight parts of the victims don't always captured in 1991 and</v>

10
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>sentenced to 16 lifetimes here was killed by a fellow prison inmates,</v>

11
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Scarborough in 1994.</v>

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And in today's video we're taking a look at the serial killers dark life.</v>

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Dahmer was born on May the 21st 1960 in Milwaukee,</v>

14
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin to Lionel,</v>

15
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>enjoy stanhope.</v>

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>He was described by his mother was a beautiful baby and both parents considered</v>

17
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>him to be a normal child,</v>

18
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but as teachers they saw them differently.</v>

19
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>At least one.</v>

20
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>His first grade teacher wondered if Jeffrey was neglected at home and noted that</v>

21
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>he was a reserved child on his report card.</v>

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>In truth,</v>

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>both of Jeffrey's parents didn't spend a lot of time with him when Jeffrey was</v>

24
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:29.431
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

25
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>His father was in college earning a chemistry degree and Jeffrey's mother was</v>

26
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>often bedridden,</v>

27
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>recovering from illnesses.</v>

28
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>His parents had a tumultuous marriage that he later described as extreme tension</v>

29
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>from the constant arguing Italian,</v>

30
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>yet there was no doubt Lionel and Joyce Dahmer love their son and tried to do</v>

31
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>the best for him when he was six years old where I Jeffrey might not take well</v>

32
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>to a new baby brother.</v>

33
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>They let him pick out his name.</v>

34
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey named his younger brother David.</v>

35
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>The Donner family moved a few times before eventually settling in bath in Ohio</v>

36
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>in 1968.</v>

37
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 1>If there were any red flags that indicated future violence in the young Jeffrey,</v>

38
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>it was this fascination with animal bones and how they fit together.</v>

39
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>The interest in caucuses began when he was four years old.</v>

40
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Once a Jeffrey was helping his father,</v>

41
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>clear animal remains from under the house,</v>

42
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and Jeffrey was oddly thrilled by the sound of the boons dropping into the metal</v>

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>buckets he lays.</v>

44
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>It began collecting them,</v>

45
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>searching in ditches and along streets for roadkill.</v>

46
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>He began dismembering the bodies behind the house in a patch of wooded area,</v>

47
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>installed the various body parts in John's in the families woodshed.</v>

48
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

49
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey decapitated the corpse of a dog before nailing the body to a tree when</v>

50
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>he was 10 years old.</v>

51
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So over dinner,</v>

52
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey asked his father what would happen if chicken bones were placed in each</v>

53
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>line or a chemist interpreted his son's question,</v>

54
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>is miss scientific curiosity?</v>

55
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>And he took the opportunity to teach your son about the proper way to clean and</v>

56
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>to preserve his collections.</v>

57
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey later admitted that the age of 14 that he experiencing sexual</v>

58
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.804
<v Speaker 1>compulsion.</v>

59
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>He designed boys,</v>

60
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.971
<v Speaker 1>not girls,</v>

61
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>and these sexual fantasies involved submission,</v>

62
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>violence and death.</v>

63
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>He began drinking as a teenager to suppress his urges and didn't talk to anyone</v>

64
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>about the disturbing thoughts that he was having.</v>

65
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 16,</v>

66
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>he fantasized about raping a jogger.</v>

67
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>He saw regularly and plans to attack the man one day,</v>

68
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Land Way to the baseball bats and the bushes along the man's regular</v>

69
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>route.</v>

70
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>The man didn't come by that day and Jeffrey never attempted to carry it out</v>

71
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:30.214
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

72
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I revere high school.</v>

73
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Most of his classmates thought of Diana as an outcast with few friends.</v>

74
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Some were troubled by his heavy drinking.</v>

75
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.230
<v Speaker 1>They drunk both and beer and liquor at school,</v>

76
00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:39.761
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going,</v>

77
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>it's inside the lining of his army.</v>

78
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Fatigue jacket,</v>

79
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>his grades one average,</v>

80
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and then took a dive as his drinking spun out of control in 1977.</v>

81
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>He played clarinet briefly and abandoned was a decent tennis player.</v>

82
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.521
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>

83
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>his teachers observe Jeffrey is a polite and quiet boy,</v>

84
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>although he was awkward,</v>

85
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he regularly amused as classmates by staging pranks such as acting out seizures,</v>

86
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>knocking over items,</v>

87
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and making loud and obnoxious noises.</v>

88
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>The banks were so popular that similar behavior was referred to as doing a</v>

89
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Dhamma by the end of high school of parents,</v>

90
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.021
<v Speaker 1>troubled marriage.</v>

91
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>She finally came to an end after an unsuccessful attempt at counseling in early</v>

92
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>1978 line or moved out of the house dominant.</v>

94
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks after graduation.</v>

95
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Dharma committed his first murder when he picked up a hitchhiker 18 year old</v>

96
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Steven Marks was on his way to a rock concert when Donna Lord him back to his</v>

97
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>house to hang out and drink a few beers before the show.</v>

98
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>My now dominant lived alone as his parents,</v>

99
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>his house,</v>

100

102
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.580

103
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.270
<v Speaker 1>leave dominant,</v>

104
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't want him to so he struck him in the head with a 10 pound dumbbell and</v>

105
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>strangled him to death.</v>

106
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>While Hicks was unconscious,</v>

107
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>he then proceeded to masturbate over his body,</v>

108
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>moved him to the crawlspace under the house,</v>

109
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and they selected as body before burying it in a shallow grave.</v>

110
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Several weeks later,</v>

111

114
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>He crushed his bones with a sledge hammer and sprinkled them in the woodlot</v>

115
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>behind the house.</v>

116
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.691
<v Speaker 1>A short time later,</v>

117
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>diamonds father visited his son and learns that he was living alone.</v>

118

141
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.300
<v Speaker 1>They have checked into a hotel room together and drank heavily,</v>

142
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>and Donald woke in the morning and discovered the body next to him.</v>

143
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Dama bought a large suitcase to transport two Emmys,</v>

144
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.220
<v Speaker 1>remains to his grandmother's basement,</v>

145
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.820

146
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.670
<v Speaker 1>so for disposing of the remains only after dominic kills another two victims of</v>

147
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>his grandmother's home,</v>

148
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.270
<v Speaker 1>did she tire of his late nights in his drunkenness.</v>

149
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>She had no knowledge of his other activities and forced them to move out of the</v>

150
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>premises.</v>

151
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>In 1988,</v>

152
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.500
<v Speaker 1>that September of 1988 Dahmer had an extremely lucky escape and encounter with a</v>

153
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:07.180
<v Speaker 1>13 year old Laotian by resulted in charges of sexual exploitation and second</v>

154
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:08.710
<v Speaker 1>degree sexual assault for diamond.</v>

155
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.430
<v Speaker 1>He pled guilty claiming that the boy had appeared much older while awaiting</v>

156
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 1>sentencing for the sexual assault case.</v>

157
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Dahmer again,</v>

158
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.950
<v Speaker 1>put his grandmother's basement to a gruesome use.</v>

159
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.240
<v Speaker 1>In March of 1989,</v>

160
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.590
<v Speaker 1>he learned drugged,</v>

161
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 1>strangled,</v>

162
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>sodomized,</v>

163
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.810
<v Speaker 1>photographed,</v>

164
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.643
<v Speaker 1>dismembered,</v>

165
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and disposed of Antony caesars and aspiring model at his trial for child</v>

166
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:28.991
<v Speaker 1>molestation.</v>

167
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 1>In 1989,</v>

168
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Dima was the model of contrition.</v>

169
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>He argued eloquently in his own defense about how he had seen the error of his</v>

170
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>ways and that his arrest marked a turning point in his life.</v>

171
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>His defense counsel argued that he needed treatment,</v>

172
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>not incarceration,</v>

173
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and the judge agreed handing down a one year prison sentence on day release,</v>

174
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>allowing dumber to work his job during the day and to return to prison at night</v>

175
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.010
<v Speaker 1>as well as handing down a five year probationary sentence.</v>

176
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Years later in an interview with CNN line or dominant,</v>

177
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>stated that he wrote a letter to the court that issued that sentence requesting</v>

178
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>psychological help before his son's parole.</v>

179
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.480
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

180
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Dahmer was granted an early release by the judge off to serving only 10</v>

181
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>months of a sentence.</v>

182
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 1>He briefly lived with his grandmother following has released during which time</v>

183
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:16.330
<v Speaker 1>he does not appear to added to his body counts before moving back into his own</v>

184
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:18.130
<v Speaker 1>apartment over the following years.</v>

185
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Dom is victim counts,</v>

186
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.141
<v Speaker 1>accelerated,</v>

187
00:08:20.141 --> 00:08:22.930
<v Speaker 1>bringing his total from four to 17.</v>

188
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 1>He developed rituals as he progressed,</v>

189
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 1>experimented with mechanical means of disposal,</v>

190
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.550
<v Speaker 1>and often consuming flesh of his victims.</v>

191
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Dama are also attempted crew to the bottom is drilling into victim skulls while</v>

192
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>they were still alive and injecting them with Muriatic assets.</v>

193
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>He was careful to select victims on the fringes of society who were often</v>

194
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 1>itinerants or borderline criminal,</v>

195
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 1>making their disappearances less noticeable and reducing the likelihood of his</v>

196
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:49.380
<v Speaker 1>capture as the murders piled up.</v>

197
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Adama was still unsatisfied.</v>

198
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 1>He stated later I was completely swept along with my own compulsion.</v>

199
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else to put it.</v>

200
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>It didn't satisfy me completely,</v>

201
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I was thinking maybe another one will maybe this one will and the</v>

202
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>numbers started growing and growing and just got out of control.</v>

203
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>As you can see on May the 27th,</v>

204
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:08.791
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

205
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.331
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

206
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.051
<v Speaker 1>Dom Is Neda.</v>

207
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Sandra Smith called the police to report that an Asian boy was running naked in</v>

208
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>the streets when the police arrived,</v>

209
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>the boy was incoherence and they accepted the word of dimer,</v>

210
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>a wise man living in a largely poor African American community that the boy was</v>

211
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 1>his 19 year old lover.</v>

212
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.271
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

213
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>the boy was 14 years old and he was the brother of the 14 year old teen that</v>

214
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Donna had previously molested the police escorted dahmer and the boy home and</v>

215
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.151
<v Speaker 1>cleaning,</v>

216
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>not wishing to become embroiled in a homosexual domestic disturbance,</v>

217
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 1>took only accustomed to look around before leaving.</v>

218
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Once the police left the scene,</v>

219
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Donna killed the boy and proceeded with his usual rituals are they conducted</v>

220
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>even a basic search,</v>

221
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>police officers would've found the body of dominance.</v>

222
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:53.691
<v Speaker 1>Twelfth Victim Tony Hughes before he was finally arrested on July the 22nd 1991,</v>

223
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.380
<v Speaker 1>he killed for more manual.</v>

224
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.201
<v Speaker 1>Dom is cunning.</v>

225
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Spree ended when he was arrested on July the 22nd 1991 that day to Milwaukee.</v>

226
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Police officers picked up Tracy Edwards,</v>

227
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.480
<v Speaker 1>a 32 year old African American man who was wandering the streets with a</v>

228
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.190
<v Speaker 1>headscarf dangling from his wrist.</v>

229
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Speaker 1>They decided to investigate the man's claims that we dude had drugged and</v>

230
00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:24.014
<v Speaker 1>restrained him.</v>

231
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 1>They arrived at domus apartments where he commonly offered to get the keys for</v>

232
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:28.034
<v Speaker 1>the handcuffs.</v>

233
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Edwards claimed the knife dahmer had threatened him with was in the bedroom,</v>

234
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.400
<v Speaker 1>and the officer went in to corroborate the story.</v>

235
00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:37.790
<v Speaker 1>He noticed a polaroid photographs of dismembered bodies lying around.</v>

236
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It was at that point that Donna was subdued by the officers.</v>

237
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Subsequent searches revealed a heads in the refrigerator,</v>

238
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.740
<v Speaker 1>three more in the freezer and the catalog of other horrors including preserved</v>

239
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.380
<v Speaker 1>skulls.</v>

240
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.540
<v Speaker 1>John's containing jenise Eylea and an extensive gallery of macabre polaroid</v>

241
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.050
<v Speaker 1>photographs if its victims.</v>

242
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Dom is refrigerator and polaroid photographs became inextricably associated with</v>

243
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:00.440
<v Speaker 1>his notorious killing spree.</v>

244
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>In 1996 following dominance death,</v>

245
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.970
<v Speaker 1>a group of Milwaukee businessman raised more than $400,000 to purchase the items</v>

246
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:09.320
<v Speaker 1>that he used for his victims,</v>

247
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>including blades,</v>

248
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.120
<v Speaker 1>source,</v>

249
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.751
<v Speaker 1>handcuffs,</v>

250
00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.790
<v Speaker 1>and a refrigerator to store the body parts.</v>

251
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.390
<v Speaker 1>They promptly destroyed them in an effort to distance the city from the horrors</v>

252
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:17.691
<v Speaker 1>of dom,</v>

253
00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:18.524
<v Speaker 1>his actions,</v>

254
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and the ensuing media circus that surrounded his trial.</v>

255
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey dom is trial began in January of 1992,</v>

256
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.200
<v Speaker 1>given that the majority of dominance victims were African American.</v>

257
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 1>There were considerable racial tensions and say strict security precautions were</v>

258
00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:43.360
<v Speaker 1>taken,</v>

259
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.810
<v Speaker 1>including an eight foot barrier of bulletproof glass that separated him from the</v>

260
00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:47.410
<v Speaker 1>gallery.</v>

261
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.790
<v Speaker 1>The inclusion of only one African American on the jury provoked further unrest,</v>

262
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.340
<v Speaker 1>but was ultimately contains.</v>

263
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very short lived well.</v>

264
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I know Donna and to second wife attended the trial throughout dahmer initially</v>

265
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.670
<v Speaker 1>pled not guilty to all charges despite having confessed to the killings during</v>

266
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>police interrogation,</v>

267
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 1>but he eventually changed his plea to guilty by virtue of insanity.</v>

268
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.910
<v Speaker 1>His defense then offered the gruesome details of his behavior as proof that only</v>

269
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>someone truly insane which commit assumption terrible acts.</v>

270
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Donna later said in an interview,</v>

271
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to believe that a human being could have done what I've done,</v>

272
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>but I know that I did it.</v>

273
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 1>The jury chose to believe the prosecutions of sessions,</v>

274
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 1>that dom was fully aware that his acts were evil and that he chose to commit</v>

275
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>them anyway.</v>

276
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.340
<v Speaker 1>On February the 15th,</v>

277
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:32.651
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

278
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.280
