1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It was the all American boy,</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>handsome,</v>

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

4
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>charming.</v>

5
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:03.841
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

6
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>theodore rubbish Bundy was the stereotype of what every American boy or to be</v>

7
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>like and what every American parents wanted their son to aspire to you.</v>

8
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>

9
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>ted Bundy was charming.</v>

10
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>He had a winsome way that could in people.</v>

11
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Yet this same college wunderkind snuffed out to the lives of scores of beautiful</v>

12
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>young women.</v>

13
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>He was a charismatic killer,</v>

14
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>who's Jacquelyn hype.</v>

15
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we're so vastly different that he fooled his closest associates for</v>

16
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

17
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>many of them would still not believe that there Ted could commit to the</v>

18
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>atrocious crimes that were piling up alongside his name,</v>

19
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>even as the evidence became overwhelming,</v>

20
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>he made a mockery of law enforcement running rings around their attempts to</v>

21
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>catch the world's first serial killer.</v>

22
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Bundys brilliant minds made him a master Predator with his abductions being as</v>

23
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>well planned as a military action.</v>

24
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>He has gone down as the most infamous serial killer in US history today,</v>

25
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>decades after his execution in the electric chair.</v>

26
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>He is held up by many as a macabre celebrity.</v>

27
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>The poster boy for mass murder.</v>

28
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>His story is a paradox.</v>

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.291
<v Speaker 1>In his past,</v>

30
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>there were no signs of the deviant behavior that would manifest itself in an</v>

31
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>insatiable bloodlust.</v>

32
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.133
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't in fact,</v>

33
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>on track for a brilliant career on the other side of the law as a prosecuting</v>

34
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>attorney.</v>

35
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>His performance in his own defense showed what a great promise that Korea had</v>

36
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>held upon sentencing Bundy to die.</v>

37
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Judge Edward o coward summed up the feeling of so many new ones were affected by</v>

38
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Bundy.</v>

39
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It is a total waste of humanity that I've ever experienced in this course.</v>

40
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You are a bright young man.</v>

41
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>You've made a good lawyer.</v>

42
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd have loved to have had you practice in front of me,</v>

43
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but the UN's another way,</v>

44
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:33.084
<v Speaker 1>Patna.</v>

45
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>As we examined Bundy story,</v>

46
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>we got closer to answering the question of why he chose the way he did,</v>

47
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.053
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

48
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>even with this analysis,</v>

49
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>we may never really know.</v>

50
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Just before we get started with the biographics video today about Ted Bundy,</v>

51
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>if you like this sort of dark stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'll find a link to it in the description below.</v>

58
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>and let's get into it.</v>

59
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>He adored Robert Bundy,</v>

60
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>was born to 22 year old element Lewis Cowl on November the 24th,</v>

61
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>1946.</v>

62
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>His father was a sailor who'd never hung around to meet his newborn son when he</v>

63
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:15.221
<v Speaker 1>was four.</v>

64
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:15.821
<v Speaker 1>Ted's mother,</v>

65
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>who was told was his oldest sister,</v>

66
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>took him 3000 miles away to tacoma,</v>

67
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Washington to live with other family members.</v>

68
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Ted was heartbroken to be taken away from his grandfather with whom he had</v>

69
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>developed a special bonds,</v>

70
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 1>although no one ever replaced his grandfather and his affection Ted scene became</v>

71
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>close friends with his two cousins,</v>

72
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Jane and Allan Scott.</v>

73
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

74
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>his mother was making a friendship of it.</v>

75
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Elena was now going by the name of Louis.</v>

76
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>She joins the methodist church and seemed crossed paths with a young man by the</v>

77
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>name of Johnny Colpepper Bundy.</v>

78
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Bundy stood five foot tall.</v>

79
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>He was a cook and came across as a shy and reserved kind of guy,</v>

80
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but newies sensed that he was kind and dependable.</v>

81
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Soon Raymond said blossoms after a well winds of methodists,</v>

82
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>social functions.</v>

83
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Louise and Johnny were married on May the 19th,</v>

84
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>51.</v>

85
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>The family bought a home there,</v>

86
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>narrows bridge while Johnny kept on working as a cook.</v>

87
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>There we use 10 heads to secretarial work.</v>

88
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Children followed two boys and two girls as he grew up.</v>

89
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Ted was often pressed into babysitting service.</v>

90
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>He willingly complied even though it would usually mean missing out on outings</v>

91
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.144
<v Speaker 1>with friends.</v>

92
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Although the family dynamics were stable,</v>

93
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>ted was to grow up in an environment of untruths and uncertainty.</v>

94
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>He was still being fed the line that his mother was his sister and his</v>

95
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:26.411
<v Speaker 1>grandparents.</v>

96
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Whereas actual parents during his years at high school,</v>

97
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>he ran with kids who had connections whose parents were either rich or were big</v>

98
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>wigs in the school environments.</v>

99
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Ted could never match up,</v>

100
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.251
<v Speaker 1>and as a result,</v>

101
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>he was often teased where others were out giving.</v>

102
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Ted came across as shy and reserved.</v>

103
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Ted never warmed up to his father in law despite Johnny's acceptance of him and</v>

104
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>attempts to build a relationship.</v>

105
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>When Johnny became a scout leader and organized camping trips that we usually</v>

106
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>find some excuse as to why you could and attendance and adolescence.</v>

107
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Ted grew rapidly,</v>

108
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>but he found it very hard to put on muscular size.</v>

109
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 1>He was too skinny to play football that we did join the track team at hunter</v>

110
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.083
<v Speaker 1>junior high.</v>

111
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

112
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it was a classroom rather than track and field where Ted felt most comfortable.</v>

113
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>He maintained a b average,</v>

114
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>taking his schoolwork and homework very seriously.</v>

115
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Ted graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Nineteen 65.</v>

116
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>While he was making solid progress academically,</v>

117
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>he was also beginning to build a reputation that was not so favorable.</v>

118
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>He had already been in trouble with the law in relation to some petty</v>

119
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>burglaries.</v>

120
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It was also proving himself to be an unreliable worker.</v>

121
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>After graduating high school,</v>

122
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>10 began working for Tacoma city light.</v>

123
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>His plan was to attend college and the enrolled in the University of puget sound</v>

124
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>for the 1965 to 1966 year.</v>

125
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Twelve months later be transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle.</v>

126
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>He began living on campus.</v>

127
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a dormitory room.</v>

128
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>It's mcmahon.</v>

129
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Hold,</v>

130
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I think University of Washington,</v>

131
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Ted's winning personality began to manifest itself.</v>

132
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>He was charming,</v>

133
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.611
<v Speaker 1>well dressed,</v>

134
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and came across as educated.</v>

135
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's professors force.</v>

136
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.001
<v Speaker 1>He was a brilliant,</v>

137
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>studious individual with enormous potential deads charmin's good looks,</v>

138
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>made people see beyond the emptiness that was as cool</v>

139
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>it was during his freshman year at Washington u that tat first fell in love.</v>

140
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>The object of his desires was a beautiful,</v>

141
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>dark haired girl that lived nearby.</v>

142
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.971
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

143
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>as he would later describe how the most beautiful creature he had ever seen.</v>

144
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>He found out her name was Stephanie Brooks from a distance,</v>

145
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.553
<v Speaker 1>tad martyr,</v>

146
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>studying her like a specimen under a microscope.</v>

147
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>He stared at her in the lunch room,</v>

148
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>fantasizing from afar.</v>

149
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.741
<v Speaker 1>It seemed,</v>

150
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>became apparent that Stephanie was into the football jock crowd and Ted became</v>

151
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 1>despondent despite their differences.</v>

152
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>That was one thing that Ted and Stephanie had in common.</v>

153
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>They were both skiers dead thought that maybe this was his enemy showing signs</v>

154
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>of overcoming his insecurities.</v>

155
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So you took the bold step of asking if he could hit you with her to the ski</v>

156
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>slopes east of Seattle.</v>

157
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>She readily agreed.</v>

158
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Happy to have some company,</v>

159
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and thus this began the start of their unlikely romance,</v>

160
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>the pastor who's spending more time together,</v>

161
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.441
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie.</v>

162
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to enjoy his company and sought him out as potential.</v>

163
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>He had become besotted with Stephanie.</v>

164
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Soon they will love us.</v>

165
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie was 21 to 20.</v>

166
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>She was from wealthy California stock.</v>

167
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.030
<v Speaker 1>He was a legitimate.</v>

168
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>She grew up in the midst of money.</v>

169
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have anything yet.</v>

170
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>That relationship worked and they went steady for the next year.</v>

171
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>For Stephanie With Tad was an enjoyable extended fling.</v>

172
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>She was in love with him.</v>

173
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

174
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>That's not in the way that he was with her.</v>

175
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>She had known from the start,</v>

176
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>but the relationship was never really going anywhere.</v>

177
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.200
<v Speaker 1>That spend some time together,</v>

178
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>enjoy themselves,</v>

179
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>and then go their separate ways.</v>

180
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.140
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

181
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>there was no way that tends to fit into society.</v>

182
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie's graduation in June,</v>

183
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>1968.</v>

184
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the opportune time to end the romance.</v>

185
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>She'd be moving to San Francisco to find work.</v>

186
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>While Ted stayed on in Seattle,</v>

187
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>a finished his studies to say that Ted took the rejection from Stephanie badly.</v>

188
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Could be the ultimate understatements.</v>

189
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 1>He was absolutely devastated.</v>

190
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Grime author and rule who worked with dad on a Seattle a crisis hotline,</v>

191
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>believes that the breakup of his relationship with Stephanie was the catalyst</v>

192
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>for everything that followed in Ted's life.</v>

193
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Ted could not accept that the relationship was over immediately set about</v>

194
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>finding ways to weave Stephanie back.</v>

195
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>He also immersed himself in law and politics as if to drown out the agony of</v>

196
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>losing him.</v>

197
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Ted's despondency spreads through his academic life.</v>

198
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>The ones brilliant students was now struggling by the fall of 1968.</v>

200

<v Speaker 1>Several months following in despair.</v>

<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

204
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>and deviant developments,</v>

205
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>throwing himself into his studies.</v>

206

<v Speaker 1>He impressed as professors as an older student.</v>

207
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>He was truly gifted despite his rigorous study schedule to have still found time</v>

208
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 1>to frequent the bars of the university district.</v>

209
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.000
<v Speaker 1>In September of 1969,</v>

210
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the handsome laughable.</v>

212
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>They were both alone at the Sandpiper Tavin.</v>

213
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Ted made the first move asking if he could buy her a beer reluctance of first,</v>

214
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>she was soon one over by the Ted Bundy chant before she knew that she had given</v>

215
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>him her phone number.</v>

219
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>falling deeply in love with him in a sense this was a reversal of Ted's</v>

220
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Stephanie Mag,</v>

221
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>adored the ground that Ted walks on,</v>

222
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>yet it was less committed his mind often on other things and other people.</v>

223
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>He was still pining for Stephanie,</v>

224
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but meg would do in the meantime.</v>

<v Speaker 1>father to her young daughter.</v>

232
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.840

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>During how awesome vacation Ted took Stephanie to dinner at the home of his</v>

284
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:07.861
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>

285
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Ross Davis introduced her as his fiance.</v>

286
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Then he whisked her off for a weekend in the snow.</v>

287
00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:13.231
<v Speaker 1>What a cascade.</v>

288
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Poss.</v>

289
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>He had books a luxurious come to for just the two of them.</v>

290
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Over the course of that weekend,</v>

291
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie fell in love with Ted all over again.</v>

292
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>When he began talking with marriage plans.</v>

293
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>She excitedly joined in future plans for a life of domestic bliss.</v>

294
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>We're made of course,</v>

295
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 1>neither Stephanie Nor meg knew of the other's plans to marry Ted Bundy,</v>

296
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>often his weekends with Stephanie.</v>

297
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

298
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>he began to evade talk of marriage with meg.</v>

299
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to be getting very cold feet towards the end of 1973.</v>

300
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Ted Managed to coordinate is to love lives so that he could wine and Dine</v>

301
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.733
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie more liberally.</v>

302
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.050
<v Speaker 1>He brought her to Seattle and they dined at various restaurants throughout China</v>

303
00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

304
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.241
<v Speaker 1>Strangely,</v>

305
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 1>the Stephanie was sensing that something was different.</v>

306
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It was becoming less affectionate.</v>

307
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 1>He stopped talking about marriage plans.</v>

308
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 1>He confessed that he had been having an affair with another woman and that she</v>

309
00:10:57.871 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>had ended up having an abortion.</v>

310
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>He was becoming cold,</v>

311
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.261
<v Speaker 1>clinical,</v>

312
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>and uncaring towards Stephanie.</v>

313
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even buy her Christmas present despite our attempts to get to the</v>

314
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>bottom of his strange change in attitudes.</v>

315
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie was unable to discover why Ted had become so cold to water.</v>

316
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.900
<v Speaker 1>He simply wouldn't let her in.</v>

317
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>When she flew back to San Francisco at the start of the new year,</v>

318
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Ted appeared to be glad to be getting rid of her.</v>

319
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie waited for Ted to reach out for an explanation as to why he attends,</v>

320
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but it never came.</v>

321
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.440
<v Speaker 1>In February of 1974,</v>

322
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>she phones him angrily demanding an explanation.</v>

323
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>He simply hung up on her hands with that,</v>

324
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie would never again speak to tat.</v>

325
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>During the first six months of 1974,</v>

326
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 1>eight women went missing from college campuses in Washington,</v>

327
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:41.311
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>

328
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 1>and Utah.</v>

329
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the photos of these women,</v>

330
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:46.950
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but be struck by how much they looked alike.</v>

331
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 1>They all had small frames,</v>

332
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>long hair that was parted in the middle,</v>

333
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and what good looking every one of them resembled Stephanie Brooks.</v>

334
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>As the case files mounted.</v>

335
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 1>The killer left no trace.</v>

336
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Investigators were surprised and immensely frustrated.</v>

337
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>The demand could commit such brazen abductions and leave absolutely no trace of</v>

338
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>evidence in its wake.</v>

339
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

340
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 1>each attack would be slightly more brazen than the last.</v>

341
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>The adapter would snatch girls who were in closer proximity to others almost as</v>

342
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>if he was daring anyone to stop him.</v>

343
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Located at the southern end of Lake Sammamish and King County,</v>

344
00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Washington Lake Sammamish state park.</v>

345
00:12:21.861 --> 00:12:26.861
<v Speaker 1>It covers 512 acres and features 6,858 feet of waterfront.</v>

346
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.490
<v Speaker 1>The level landscape features buttercup filled pastures and is dotted with trees</v>

347
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.080
<v Speaker 1>in the summer of 1974.</v>

348
00:12:33.081 --> 00:12:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a popular bathing spot and sunning spot for thousands of local residence.</v>

349
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Lifeguards patrolled and it was a range is hot on site.</v>

350
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.070
<v Speaker 1>On July the 14th,</v>

351
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>1974 legs and Hamish was packed with excess of 40,000 people who were eager to</v>

352
00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:47.300
<v Speaker 1>make the most of the glorious summer weather.</v>

353
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Among the throngs of Sunseeker is on that day was an attractive woman who was</v>

354
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:54.560
<v Speaker 1>sunbathing by herself on the beach no sooner had she settled into a tanning</v>

355
00:12:54.561 --> 00:12:54.951
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

356
00:12:54.951 --> 00:12:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Then she looked up to see a man towering over hat.</v>

357
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.260
<v Speaker 1>He was wearing a white t shirt and jeans and his right arm.</v>

358
00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:01.094
<v Speaker 1>Was it a cost?</v>

359
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

360
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to bother you.</v>

361
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>He began.</v>

362
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering if you could help me out.</v>

363
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.500
<v Speaker 1>The gold looks over at him.</v>

364
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.960
<v Speaker 1>He was good looking and seemed somewhat nerdy to happen.</v>

365
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.740
<v Speaker 1>She didn't sense any danger from him.</v>

366
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Help you out with what she asked.</v>

367
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.550
<v Speaker 1>He had knelt down beside her and explained that he needed to launch a sail boat,</v>

368
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.440
<v Speaker 1>but couldn't do it with this cast on it.</v>

369
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.800
<v Speaker 1>He offered to take her for a ride in the boats and he was exceedingly charming.</v>

370
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

371
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.031
<v Speaker 1>she would go with him.</v>

372
00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:26.840
<v Speaker 1>She said as they were walking to where the man said his sailboat was.</v>

373
00:13:26.841 --> 00:13:31.010
<v Speaker 1>He offered his name tat it was about this time that the girl got cold feet.</v>

374
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.700
<v Speaker 1>She begged off saying that the parents were waiting for her to other young women</v>

375
00:13:34.701 --> 00:13:35.511
<v Speaker 1>of the leg that day.</v>

376
00:13:35.511 --> 00:13:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They weren't so lucky.</v>

377
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three year olds jenise often to 18 year olds.</v>

378
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Denise Naslund winds along with Ted's and were never seen again.</v>

379
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Ted had dramatically onto the stakes.</v>

380
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Not only had he freely given his name to a potential victim,</v>

381
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>but he had approached at least six women on that Sunday afternoon in broad</v>

382
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:51.860
<v Speaker 1>daylight.</v>

383
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Clearly he was feeling invincible.</v>

384
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.570
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing that the bundling law enforcement officials could do to stop</v>

385
00:13:56.571 --> 00:13:56.990
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

386
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>He was far too clever for them police.</v>

387
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:01.820
<v Speaker 1>They were able to produce a composite sketch of Ted based on the statements of</v>

388
00:14:01.821 --> 00:14:02.654
<v Speaker 1>the eye witnesses.</v>

389
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.760
<v Speaker 1>This was circulated up and down the country.</v>

390
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Three thousand 500 tips poured in from the public.</v>

391
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.440
<v Speaker 1>The police compiled a list of potential suspects.</v>

392
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Name Ted Bundy.</v>

393
00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:11.810
<v Speaker 1>His name was on that list,</v>

394
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.060
<v Speaker 1>but it has more than 2000 people on it.</v>

395
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Ted's moved to Salt Lake City on Thanksgiving weekends in 1974 to attend law</v>

396
00:14:21.171 --> 00:14:21.710
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

397
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Immediately secured a job as a security guard at the university.</v>

398
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.670
<v Speaker 1>The initial focus of the Utah killings,</v>

399
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.750
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the small towns that lead within the vicinity of Salt Lake City.</v>

400
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.110
<v Speaker 1>They began on October,</v>

401
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:31.580
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

402
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.660
<v Speaker 1>1974,</v>

403
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.220
<v Speaker 1>the victim with 16 year olds,</v>

404
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Nancy Wilcox.</v>

405
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.860
<v Speaker 1>She disappeared from holiday.</v>

406
00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:38.900
<v Speaker 1>A small town just out of Salt Lake City.</v>

407
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.210
<v Speaker 1>That so you could walk to the store to buy some gum,</v>

408
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Speaker 1>and she was last seen by an eye witness getting into a light brown Volkswagen</v>

409
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.750
<v Speaker 1>bug tabs next to the 18th.</v>

410
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.660
<v Speaker 1>This time the victim was the daughter of the Midvale police chief,</v>

411
00:14:50.661 --> 00:14:51.494
<v Speaker 1>Louis Smith,</v>

412
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the third Utah victim with 17 year old Laura Amy from Lahey,</v>

413
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>25 miles south of Salt Lake City.</v>

414
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It was October the 31st Halloween night.</v>

415
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Laura was a high school dropout who had moved out of our higher minimum with our</v>

416
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:02.800
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

417
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.460
<v Speaker 1>bought at the lack of action that night.</v>

418
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.310
<v Speaker 1>She had left a local cafe just often,</v>

419
00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>midnights and proceeded to walk to a local park.</v>

420
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>She was never seen again.</v>

421
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Less than a month later,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ted abducted an 18 year old girl from a local mall by impersonating a police</v>

423

<v Speaker 1>officer.</v>

424
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

425
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>she managed to break free from his call moments after he had slapped handcuffs</v>

426
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>on one of her wrists,</v>

427

<v Speaker 1>a frustrated Ted's drove for another 17 miles before coming to the humans</v>

428
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>highschool where a school production was in progress.</v>

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It he murdered at least five women during a six month period.</v>

432
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Burying best skulls in a bizarre graveyard in the Taylor mountains</v>

433
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.100
<v Speaker 1>in the early morning hours of August,</v>

434
00:15:45.101 --> 00:15:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the 16th of 1975.</v>

435
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.880
<v Speaker 1>The police finally caught up with Ted Bundy,</v>

436
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 1>a minor traffic violation.</v>

437
00:15:50.381 --> 00:15:51.560
<v Speaker 1>They do a search of his car,</v>

438
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.020
<v Speaker 1>which produced a burglar's.</v>

439
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:53.321
<v Speaker 1>Kits,</v>

440
00:15:53.321 --> 00:15:54.910
<v Speaker 1>competes with handcuffs and rope.</v>

441
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.240
<v Speaker 1>The authorities were seeing able to connect the dots and charges of aggravated</v>

442
00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:00.550
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping and criminal assaults were brought against him.</v>

443
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.660
<v Speaker 1>He was found guilty and sentenced to 1:15 years for the police.</v>

444
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.800
<v Speaker 1>This was just the stars.</v>

445
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.190
<v Speaker 1>They now set about building a case to hold you accountable for the trail of</v>

446
00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:10.750
<v Speaker 1>bodies that he'd left in his wake.</v>

447
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Dad was adamant that he would defend himself in the upcoming trial and was given</v>

448
00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:18.820
<v Speaker 1>access to the Aspen Law Library to do research during a visit to the law library</v>

449
00:16:18.821 --> 00:16:19.720
<v Speaker 1>on June the 17th,</v>

450
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.141
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

451
00:16:20.141 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 1>76 months.</v>

452
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>He managed to use the power of a second story window.</v>

453
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.240
<v Speaker 1>He went straight for the local river bank.</v>

454
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.630
<v Speaker 1>He took off his courtroom outfits to reveal a second set of clothes underneath.</v>

455
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.410
<v Speaker 1>He then brushed himself off and calmly walks back to the center of town.</v>

456
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.420
<v Speaker 1>That was the police rushed to set up roadblocks.</v>

457
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He wiled away as time browsing in stores.</v>

458
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It was classic Bundy.</v>

459
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.000
<v Speaker 1>After a week on the rung,</v>

460
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.850
<v Speaker 1>he was recaptured.</v>

461
00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I need to break out again.</v>

462
00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Six months later,</v>

463
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.521
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

464
00:16:42.521 --> 00:16:43.450
<v Speaker 1>he was able to evade,</v>

465
00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:44.110
<v Speaker 1>recapture,</v>

466
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.250
<v Speaker 1>and set out for Florida.</v>

467
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.100
<v Speaker 1>He set himself up in the vicinity of Florida State University.</v>

468
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.090
<v Speaker 1>For over a year,</v>

469
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.970
<v Speaker 1>he managed to control his urges until on the night of January,</v>

470
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:52.541
<v Speaker 1>the 14th,</v>

471
00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:52.871
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

472
00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:53.590
<v Speaker 1>78,</v>

473
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.060
<v Speaker 1>his demons were unleashed in an orgy of violence that left to girl's dead and to</v>

474
00:16:58.061 --> 00:16:58.241
<v Speaker 1>mall,</v>

475
00:16:58.241 --> 00:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>hardly decent at the Ci Omega Sorority House.</v>

476
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Over the following weeks,</v>

477
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Tad continued his rampage killing a 14 year old girl and attempting to abduct</v>

478
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:10.390
<v Speaker 1>another was the girl,</v>

479
00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:14.350
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of a police detective helps police produce an identical picture and</v>

480
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.990
<v Speaker 1>is that along with a series of mistakes on Ted's part,</v>

481
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.510
<v Speaker 1>led to his recapture around February the 15th,</v>

482
00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:19.841
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

483
00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:20.674
<v Speaker 1>78.</v>

484
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

485
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 1>there would be no escape.</v>

486
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.610
<v Speaker 1>After a lengthy trial in which he defended himself,</v>

487
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Ted Bundy was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death and the electric</v>

488
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 1>chap,</v>

489
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.070
<v Speaker 1>he spent a decade appealing.</v>

490
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:33.130
<v Speaker 1>The decision was finally executed on January the 24th,</v>

491
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.551
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

492
00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:34.360
<v Speaker 1>89.</v>

493
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.990
<v Speaker 1>By that time,</v>

494
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.010
<v Speaker 1>the bundy phenomenon grown with legion of mainly female fans who would fall in</v>

495
00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:41.650
<v Speaker 1>love with tess and wrote passionate love letters to him.</v>

496
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.630
<v Speaker 1>It seems that they conveniently forgot,</v>

497
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.900
<v Speaker 1>but he was one of the most cold hearted killers in history,</v>
