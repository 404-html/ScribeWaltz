1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.990
Just before we get started.

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:04.500
I do want to say that there's going to be a lot of French pronunciations in this

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:08.460
one.
Indeed.
The character of this video is Joan of arc.

4
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:11.220
I'm going with the accepted English pronunciation of her name.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.070
If you want to have a go at me in the comments you can.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
She's one of history's youngest warriors as an age when most of us were

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.920
stressing out about what to wear to school,

8
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.430
Joan of arc was leading thousands of French troops into battle against the

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:29.850
English,

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
supposedly inspired by divine visions of Catholicism's Greatest Saints Joan

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.710
first a copper sword at age 16 she was leading armies by 17 and she was burned

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:43.470
at the stake before she was even 20 in a short life.

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.950
She managed to change the course of the hundred years war ending English

14
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:51.930
domination of France.
Certainly not bad fun,
illiterate girl from the sticks,

15
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.890
but while most of us know the name Joan of Arc and no her tragic ends,

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.040
how much do we actually know about her life?
Well,

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.720
join us today as we take a look at this simple peasant girl who changed European

18
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:07.260
history before dying alone and disgraced,

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.240
convinced that she was a failure.

20
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.180
We don't know today the exact date of Jones birth.

21
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:23.181
All we know is that it was sometime in 1412 to a farming family of some means.

22
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.950
Now,
some means it is definitely a relative term.

23
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.440
Joan's village of Dom Remey in northeastern France was shockingly port still.

24
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.770
Her father is John managed to scrape together 50 acres of farmlands and the

25
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.960
family lived in the biggest house in the town for Young Joan life in don't run

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.601
the men's,

27
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:43.260
a life of sewing and taking care of animals as a girl in medieval Europe.

28
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:46.830
No one taught her to read and write or do other manly things.

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.930
They did teach her how to pray though.

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.310
Joan's mother Isabel Rami was a devout Catholic and how developed was sheep?

31
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
Well,
does evidence Isabelle may have made a pilgrimage to Rome earlier in life?

32
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.250
Crazy feat for a woman living at a time when traveling three villages over

33
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.590
mentor days riding and the knowledge that you might be killed by bandits,

34
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.220
but as well,

35
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.730
they've done a time when public devotion afforded a woman a certain level of

36
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:10.560
respect that was not found elsewhere.

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.220
Early 15th Century France was filled with female visionaries who it was taken as

38
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.320
fact could communicate with God.

39
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.200
While Isabelle herself never claimed to be a mystic,

40
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:23.220
she likely told young June all about these women still drones.

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.820
Early life was relatively uneventful.
She became a master seamstress.

42
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.510
She works on her dad's farm.
She made a handful of friends.

43
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.900
Had she been born at a different time.
It's downfall.

44
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.980
We'd be talking about her at all.
Heck,

45
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:38.310
it's doubtful those in dom Remey would have even remembered her,

46
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.130
but Joan wasn't born at any time.

47
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:46.131
She was born in 1412 in northern France and northern France in 1412 was a place

48
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.780
in the grip of a destructive conflicts.

49
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.760
Joan of arc had been born at slap bang in the middle of the hundred years war.

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.030
The Hundred Years War could win awards for the least accurately named historical

51
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:05.110
events.
In fact,

52
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:09.560
it was a series of wars between England and France and it lasted 116 years is

53
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:10.750
not a hundred now.

54
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.230
Normally what we do is we had mentioned the hundred years war and we're just

55
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:14.771
move on.

56
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:19.490
But Joan of arcs life was so short and so tied up in the hundred years war that

57
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.470
we'd have to keep holding the narrative every two seconds just to stop you from

58
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.680
going.
What's going on?
Seven.

59
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.070
So like a fun Pixar short here is our quick biography of the 100 years war.

60
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.160
That was not a hundred years and wasn't really a single war.

61
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.780
So 10 66 for Norman King William the conqueror earns his nickname by conquering

62
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.010
England's.
Crucially,

63
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.040
he retained his claim on the French thrown as did his descendants then eat 300

64
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.920
years later in 1328 King Charles the fourth of France,
he dies.

65
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.040
This was super good news for Williams descendant,

66
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.340
Edward the third who was next in line for the throne.

67
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.820
So at this point you've already thinking,
well,

68
00:03:55.821 --> 00:04:00.340
I got news that we get two countries,
right?
Well,
no.
Instead,
the French crowns,

69
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.910
local Noble Phillip,
the Sig,

70
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.610
all while blowing raspberries across the channel at England's fed up with all of

71
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.890
these Frenchies taunting in his general direction.

72
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.040
Edward went to war with France in 1337 by 1360 everyone was tired of warring and

73
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.700
Edward accepted a trunk of northern France in return for abandoning his claims

74
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:20.500
to the throne.
So the warring,

75
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:24.610
it stops in cell 1380 when the French crowns crazy.

76
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:25.540
Charles the sick,

77
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.160
the guy who genuinely believed that he was made of gloss Charles the sixth was

78
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:34.600
sewing capable of ruling that he created a power vacuum in 1407 the French

79
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:38.320
houses of only on and Burgundy actually went to war to fill it.

80
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.030
The house of Bergen's.
He,
by the way,

81
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.910
that's an name you're going to want to remember.

82
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.830
So a year off to Joan was born in 1413 Henry the fifth was crowned King of

83
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.020
England,
desperate to revive his claims of the French throne.

84
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:53.350
Henry demanded to marry one of Charles the sixth,
his daughters the French.

85
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:56.110
In response to that,
we're pretty much like my arm that's not happening.

86
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.770
And England and France,
they went to war yet again.

87
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.650
But this time the house of Burgundy allied with the English,

88
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.270
this led to the Treaty of Twat in 1420 when the English and Burgundians not only

89
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:09.280
booted the French up their backsides,

90
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:14.170
but made off with their pantaloons to the treaty was humiliating for France

91
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.220
alongside other stuff.

92
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:18.880
It's set things up so Henry would inherit the French thrown when Charles died.

93
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.840
But then Henry made the mistake of dying just before Charles also die,

94
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.850
technically making Henry's 10 month old son Henry the sixth king of both
nations.

95
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.270
The French decided that being ruled by a baby was just a bit ridiculous.

96
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.410
So they made Charles of Val walking in Stet and yes,

97
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.650
we were assigned to that old classic French play of screw the trees and blow

98
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.530
raspberries across the channel.
Only the English.

99
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.510
They were no longer across the channel,

100
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.750
but they were occupying the north of France.
Then included not any Paris,

101
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:50.860
but also runs a city where Charles valid Valois had to be crowns to be

102
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.180
recognized as king.

103
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.920
So that's why things were by 1425 the English and the Burgundian said everything

104
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.340
above the La River while Charles of Valois stewed to the south unable to become

105
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.990
king until he made it to romance.

106
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.040
It would take a miracle to break this deadlock and ends this near century of

107
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.270
conflicts.
Luckily though,
miracles,
what would Joan of arc was all about?

108
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.120
Just as Charles de Valois was sulking around wishing he could be King Young Joan

109
00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:23.850
of arc was having an extremely spooky experience.

110
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.110
Now age 13 Joan's life in Doremi.

111
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.830
It was much the same as it was when we last left town,

112
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.130
but there was one major difference.
As she reached puberty,

113
00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:36.100
Jones started having visions of some Catherine and Margaret of Antioch and some

114
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.800
Michael.
Now at first these visions,

115
00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:41.790
they simply told her to lead a pious life and remain a virgin,

116
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.420
but as time passed they started telling her,
you know,
actually,

117
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.390
how about you become a warrior and you put Charles of firewall on the throne?

118
00:06:49.391 --> 00:06:52.770
And that sounds pretty good right now.
As I said earlier,
female visionaries,

119
00:06:52.771 --> 00:06:54.240
they weren't uncommon in France,

120
00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:56.820
but that doesn't mean that people took them seriously.

121
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.020
The other kids they set and he laughed at Jones visions,
the visions,

122
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.050
they persisted until one day in May of 1428 when Joan was 16 the saints suddenly

123
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:11.100
told her to go to see Charles and she not now.
This was a bit of a problem.

124
00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:15.420
The war had left steadfastly pro Charles Dahmer me completely surrounded by

125
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.380
hostile Burgundy and territory which you on around 500 kilometers away.

126
00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:23.100
Any Journey Joan undertook on her own would likely have ended up with a debt,

127
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.990
so join didn't even try.

128
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.590
Instead she went to the nearby pro Charles stronghold of Van coolio.

129
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.790
Then she found the garrison commander rob ads and Bowery and she demanded that

130
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:34.580
he sends out to the rightful king robot.

131
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:37.740
ADDS about a recall responded by throwing her out on an ear.

132
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.650
When I'm joking here,

133
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:42.120
he actually told Jones and make sure that her father gave very good beating.

134
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.990
Spends.

135
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.890
Jane went back to dom Remey presumably muttering obscenities the rest of 1428 it

136
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:51.660
passed rather slowly [inaudible] and father trying to marry her off any for Joan

137
00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:55.560
to successfully argue in court that she'd taken a vow of chastity and must

138
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:59.250
remain single throughout the proceeds gen kept on talking about her visions to

139
00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:02.700
the points that the news began to seep out to other villages that were even

140
00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:03.240
stirrings,

141
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.140
that she might be the virgin prophesies do need fronds to victory over England's

142
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.020
eventually three Ms.
They reached the bag in d and forces.

143
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.210
They responded by sacking Jones village.
Now Relinda hit the house of Burgundy.

144
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.990
It was allied with England's.

145
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.630
The last thing they wanted was some prophetess saying,

146
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:23.100
Charles Valois should be the king if the sacking was meant to be a warning.

147
00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:24.870
Though it had the opposite effect.

148
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.820
In January of 1429 June returned to van coolio that she rode their word of a

149
00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:32.640
vision spread.
By the time she reached grabads Boucher core,

150
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.680
she was a minor celebrity Patrick or noticed when Joan repeated a demand to see

151
00:08:37.681 --> 00:08:39.900
Charles Magical unexpectedly agreed.

152
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.160
He gave Jones six armed man as an escort and it's pointed in the direction of

153
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:48.090
Shinola and just like that Joe Navarro was off to see the king.

154
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.980
Then we get,
you're probably wondering right

155
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.650
<v 4>now,
why did Beaudry called changes minds something.</v>

156
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.900
It was just to get this pushy peasant off his back.

157
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:04.560
How this thing though that had taken note of the Burgundians sacking June's

158
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.080
village and realized there must be something to hurt,

159
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.610
but there is a more likely explanation.
By only 1429 the French,

160
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.180
they were desperate.
Then you use of the wall coming in could not be worse.

161
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.540
The English and the Bug Indians were running riots in the north while French

162
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:23.130
forces were bankrupt and Lo and morale was back in October of 1428 the English

163
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:27.450
had laid siege to the vital town of Ali.
On word was only on,
was about to fall.

164
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.150
When it did the game,
it would be over for the French.

165
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.300
All of this may be why on February the 13 1429 Joan and so god of six men were

166
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:38.730
allowed to ride out of Van [inaudible] runs into the unknown.

167
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.520
We really cannot stress just how dangerous this was.

168
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.460
Joan was a girl riding into lawless territory.

169
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.610
It doesn't take much to imagine what set and men might've done to her.

170
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.220
Thankfully drone realize this before setting off.

171
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:53.640
She cut her hair short and again dressing in men's clothes.

172
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.770
There's evidence that it was more than just a disguise.

173
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.090
During her ride to Shannon on,

174
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.700
Joan adopted the habits of the six men that she was with.

175
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.690
She slept alongside them,
she dressed with them.
She acted like one of the boys.

176
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.110
It's something she would do well serving in Charles's army and it's likely the

177
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:11.130
key to the respect that a amen had for her live in days off to setting off Joan

178
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.350
and her entourage.
They finally arrived at Shannon.

179
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.770
The stories of what happened next.
Then the stuff of legends.

180
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.670
Charles refuse to admit this strange girl for two days before finally testing

181
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:24.450
her by hiding among his entourage and calling for her the moment she entered the

182
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:27.060
room,
Joan,
who couldn't possibly have seen him before,

183
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.200
strode at straight up to trials and declared that should've been charged by God

184
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.290
to lift the siege on all your and make him king.

185
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.100
It was an impressive display and one probably matched in the private meeting

186
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:38.970
that the two of them had.

187
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.120
Although we can't say for sure because no records of the survive,

188
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.560
what we can see is that Charles emerge from the meeting ready to give a chance.

189
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.120
This was not an easy go to all of the on,

190
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:50.850
but also to put a case to the church authorities.

191
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.310
The idea was to convince them that God was really working through hot.

192
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.430
Over the next three weeks,

193
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.940
drain fielded questions from a barrage of theologians on said with remarkable

194
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:02.120
frankness when master provability,

195
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.520
she told them to send it to all the owners so that she could prove herself by

196
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.420
lifting the siege.

197
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.870
Eventually the theologians must've figured it was a worthy shots because they

198
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:14.130
told Charles to roll with it in a brutal or 1429 Charles agreed.

199
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.920
It's a move that could have ended his crumbling regime.
I mean,

200
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.150
imagine the propaganda.
Fake King's ends diluted girl to die in battle,

201
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.330
but dying is early on.
It didn't even cross Jones mind.

202
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.870
She knew that God was on our side since she was about to prove it

203
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.711
<v 0>all the time.</v>

204
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:38.220
Joan was trying to convince channels to send it to all your other legends was

205
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:38.790
growing.

206
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.390
We know this because the French army was so broke that Charles was relying on

207
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:45.210
volunteers,
but when he put out a call but basically said,
hey,

208
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:48.540
he wants to go with this crazy girl that died of ending a random city,

209
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.940
thousands of men,
they actually responded.

210
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.880
It was the first sign of the almost mystical loyalty that June was able to

211
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.470
commands.
On April the 29 1429 Joan and a new army arrived at the siege.

212
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.980
Vone or Joan was riding atop of Whitehall.

213
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.710
Christian banner held high with some quick serve visionary work.

214
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:10.030
They gained access to the city expecting to be heralded saviors.
Instead,

215
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:12.190
they found a city on the brink of collapse.

216
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.490
All the old was at that time under the control of a man,

217
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.080
literally calls the bustard of all the arm while the title,

218
00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:23.560
what referred to his parentage.
It could have been used in our modern sense,

219
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.570
the bastard he Luther,
Joan.

220
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.560
He was gearing up to surrender and didn't need some jumped up peasant telling

221
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:31.390
him that God was going to save them.

222
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.690
He Logs Joan out of meetings and refuse to give that any role.

223
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.310
It was a move designed to get rid of her,

224
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:40.000
but it was also a move that failed to recognize one important point.

225
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.070
All of the new troops from Shinola loyal to Joan as the rank and file of only
on,

226
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:49.270
they were already turning to her site on May the fourth Joan was resting when

227
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:52.060
she suddenly had another vision telling you how to attack the English.

228
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.660
She grabbed us soiled and banner ads race down to the city,
to the east,

229
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.170
just as the French were beginning and assault on a fort at the sight of God.

230
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:01.450
Seemingly kinds of their side and rallied the French.

231
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.410
As Joan plunged into the thick of the battle,
they the ends of fight heart,

232
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.160
the fort fell and the next day another and another.

233
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.200
By the time may the seventh dorms,

234
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:14.260
the French had done the impossible that broken the siege.

235
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.540
All that remained was to make a last assault on the English and all [inaudible]

236
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.110
would be saved and the audio is Jen netter army into battle again by now.

237
00:13:23.111 --> 00:13:27.310
The English were aware of the spooky girl who made the French fight light lions

238
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.320
when the is so ha raise a banner,

239
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.220
they took aim Leanna hip drone in the shoulder pissing six inches deep.

240
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:35.500
It knocked her flat and laughter in agony.

241
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.750
She was dragged from the field for emergency surgery,

242
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.920
had gone to just abandon the French,
not even close that afternoon.

243
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.130
Despite suffering a wounds that would leave most of us curled up on the floor

244
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:46.420
waiting for our mums.

245
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.800
June returned to the battlefield the size of her banner rising once more in the

246
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.800
afternoon.
Sunlight sent up a great chair from the French.

247
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.110
They routed the English by May,
the eighth thing,
women's forces,

248
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.450
they were in full retreat.

249
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.340
Joan of arc had done exactly what should promise to do and the siege vone all it

250
00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:04.174
was either

251
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.490
if you need proof of the kinds of power Joan of arc has over the people look no

252
00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:18.120
further than what happens after the siege of [inaudible] with the English and

253
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:18.601
flights.

254
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:22.620
The French forces went to chase them only to be told by Joan in no uncertain

255
00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:26.580
terms that it was a Sunday and good Catholics.
They didn't fight on a Sunday.

256
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.340
Amazingly,
these rough men,
they listened to the English.

257
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.770
They were allowed to escape.
As they retreated.

258
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.800
It said Joan Wentz and wept over their dead.

259
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.610
A sign of respect that was not be reciprocated at our trial.

260
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.220
Not that there was much time for Jane to weep,

261
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:45.320
though she already had another task.
She needed to get Charles to Ross.

262
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.440
The problem was that roams wasn't like all the arms sitting on the front lines.

263
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:51.300
It was deep into the English territory.

264
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.360
She might as well be trying to take him do London,
but Jane,

265
00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:58.370
she gets on pressing and Chelsea was eventually like,
fine,
I'll go,

266
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.490
but you're going to have to clear a path for me first and well,

267
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.610
that's exactly what Joan did over the next few weeks around me.

268
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.330
Stormed up and down the La River.
Liberating towns,

269
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.230
so effective was sheath at the English begins to believe that she was possessed

270
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:15.620
by the devil.
Well that Joan was particularly satanic.

271
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:17.270
She never personally fought.

272
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:20.630
Instead using her banner and bravery to inspire men.

273
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.740
She also absolutely forbid her forces from looting or to rape any women.

274
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.800
The only unusual pause from a medieval perspective was the way she,

275
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.980
that she insisted on dressing with and sleeping alongside men.

276
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.250
It's because of this that modern historians have theorized that she may have

277
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:36.380
been gay or trans.
Finally,

278
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:40.100
on June the eighth June's forces met the remnants of the English at the mantle

279
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:45.101
of Putty to say Jones Army mops the floor with them would be a disservice to

280
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:49.790
mops.
They absolutely pulverized them after this.
Charles,

281
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:51.470
he couldn't ignore Joan any longer.

282
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.100
When she came back and told him to get his kingly asked arose.

283
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.570
He absolutely agreed.

284
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.070
As Jane and Charles wrote across the northern France town off town fell without

285
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:02.630
even putting up a resistance,

286
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.800
they liberated offset Szenol Trois Trois always the place where the French had

287
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:09.170
had to sign the humiliating treaty with Henry the fifth.

288
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.110
On July the 16th the raw meat finally reached Ross.

289
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.180
The gates open as they approached the city of kings at Folan just two months
ago.

290
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:20.720
The idea of getting the French all to roles was like asking John,
John,

291
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:24.590
Bing's do singlehandedly funked his way inside Darth Vader,
his private chambers.

292
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.453
Nope.

293
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.050
Now Joan and channels were triumphant the very next day,

294
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.370
July [inaudible] 17 1429 Charles,
if Ottawa was Carnegie,

295
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:34.820
had Charles the seventh of France,

296
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.850
which I stood beside him during the ceremony hands afterwards,

297
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
she knelt and Colton that king at that points a visions that just stops a

298
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.220
mission.
It was over in his,
God apparently didn't have any more plans,

299
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.960
but it seems Joan had gotten a taste for battle as Charles the seventh embarks

300
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:53.360
on a victory lap around his newly conquered territories.

301
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.950
The made of only on made a fateful decision.
She decided to go to Paris

302
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.740
on August the 28th 1429 Charles the seventh opens peace negotiations with the

303
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.520
Burgundians.

304
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.630
He wept suddenly not really so hot on their alliance with the using English.

305
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.320
The news gave June the bad feeling that any p street you might block her taking

306
00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:20.680
action against Paris.
This was a big deal as the French capital,

307
00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:23.230
it lay in the hands of the English.
So Joan,

308
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.280
she went rogue on September the eighth she better army out independently to

309
00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:31.900
attack Paris.
This was a major mistake to continue our star wars metaphor.

310
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.710
I'll taking Paris and 40 29 was like trying to break into the death star using

311
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:39.820
an anchovy,
the walls of the city.
They were nearly 30 feet high.

312
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.860
It's still Joan.
She tried waving,

313
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:43.990
have banner and demanding the power of surrender.

314
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.950
She got a crossbow through the leg for her trouble and was dragged from the

315
00:17:47.951 --> 00:17:52.410
battlefield screaming as men to continue the assault.
Instead,
they retreated.

316
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.710
When word got back to Charles about what Joan was up to during his delicate

317
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.410
negotiations,
he casts a leafs.
Yup.

318
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.730
Joe might have made him king that Charles had new problem with stopping her

319
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.390
supplies of weapons and men and then basically ignoring her.

320
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.010
While he did allow her to keep fighting,

321
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.910
it was probably just to keep her busy that Joan riding around the liberating the

322
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:15.990
old small town was a Joan not whipping up disk and tens in the army.
Still.

323
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.830
It wasn't until the spring of 1430 then it became clear just how far Charles was

324
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:23.700
distancing himself from the girl who had saved his regime during an attempt to

325
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:27.900
relive a siege on comp PN on May the 23rd June was knocked from a horse behind

326
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:30.180
enemy lines.
Seeing no point in fighting on.

327
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:34.230
She allowed herself to be captured by the Burgundian forces.
Everyone expected.

328
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:36.060
Charles took quickly trade vat.

329
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.810
Everyone they expected wrong channels just didn't lift a finger.

330
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.970
This left the Burgundians in an awkward position.

331
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.690
On the one hand is they wanted to keep Charles happy and signed a treaty with

332
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:48.210
him.
But on the other hands,
they didn't want to just return.

333
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:51.630
It is best leaders are the fields to take more Burgundian towns.

334
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.430
So in July of 1430 they'd reached a compromise.
They sold June to the English.

335
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.840
When Joan had the news,

336
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:01.110
she attempted to commit suicide by leaping from the tower of Castle,

337
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.250
but she survived.

338
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:06.300
And on January the third 1431 she was handed over to English loyalists in

339
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.590
northern France.
Sorry,

340
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.530
what did the English and their students do when they go to their grubby little

341
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:13.530
paws on the girl who made Charles the seventh king?
Well,

342
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:16.140
they took her to rule and they put her on trial

343
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.080
on March the 25th 1431 the Church authorities that wrong charge Joan on 70

344
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.040
religious points ranging from heresy you to addressing in men's clothes.

345
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.130
Whereas as that last one seems it was legit.

346
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.480
Deuteronomy chapter 22 verse five does actually contain their direct prohibition

347
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:40.940
from God on women wearing men's clothes.

348
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.610
So well now you know Jones prosecutors,

349
00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:46.910
they set theological traps trying to trip her up and doctrine.

350
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.020
One of the key parts of the Joan of Arc myth is that she was able to avoid these

351
00:19:51.021 --> 00:19:53.990
traps and leave the prosecutor's with almost nothing.

352
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.790
Those original 70 challenges.

353
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.490
The authorities were forced to through 58 of them out,

354
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.590
but let's not kid ourselves that this was just a spirited debate about theology.

355
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.670
From the moment she got to Rewind,
Joan was kept in awful conditions.

356
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.480
She was chained to a filthy beds and a filthy prison and given just enough food

357
00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:14.240
to keep her from dying day and night.
Male gods.

358
00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:18.410
They watched her taunting her and threatened her with assault on April the 18th

359
00:20:18.411 --> 00:20:22.250
Jones conditions.
They caused her to fall badly sick,
convinced she was dying.

360
00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:26.810
She begged to be allowed to see a priest.
I request it was refused.
Finally,

361
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:30.440
on May the 24th the authorities that had enough unable to settle the last 12

362
00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:34.100
points,
they dragged Joan outside for a mock execution and then basically said,

363
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:35.720
sign this confession,
all that execution.

364
00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:38.540
Next time it's going to be real dry and signed.

365
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.530
The documents contained a very specific clause forbidding her from ever dressing

366
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:44.450
as a man again under pain of death,

367
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.700
something that this clause was inserted very because a couple of days later the

368
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:52.360
authorities came to visit Joan in prison and found her dressed as a boy.

369
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.900
The official version is that Joan had claims the saints had audit how to wear

370
00:20:55.901 --> 00:21:00.040
the clothes,
but other sources suggest the cause was far darker.

371
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.820
Supposedly the Med guarding Jones stripped her naked and gave her the choice of

372
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:06.760
either putting on makeup or clothes or remaining naked before them.

373
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.580
Knowing what would happen if she remains naked.
Genuine,

374
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.210
she chose the clothes regardless of the outcome was the same.

375
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.390
On May the 30th 1431 Joan was led out of plaster view Martians tied to a stake.

376
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.490
It said that one of our gods slipped her a would increase of x on the way in

377
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:25.270
order to come for tat.
That warm Spring Day,
Joan of arc was burned alive.

378
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.110
The execution that was forbidden from easing a misery by killing her before the

379
00:21:29.111 --> 00:21:32.500
flames reached a flash and Joan died screaming in agony.

380
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.670
I reupholstered lost weds with a pitiful wailing of a teenager begging for some

381
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:41.110
Michael to rescue her.
The Angel never appeared when the execution was over,

382
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:44.980
the authorities had to remains burned again and then scattered her ashes in the

383
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:48.190
river.
The Story of Joan of arc,
it was over,

384
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.550
or was it 19 years off to join was executed.

385
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:55.000
Charles the seventh road in Rwanda by now the Hundred Years War was winding down

386
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:58.550
in the French,
were on the verge of winning.
Stood in the city where his ones,

387
00:21:58.551 --> 00:22:02.110
I'm savior Ben to death.
Charles older than an inquiry into Jones trial.

388
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.670
This inquiry ended up at the Vatican wearing 1456 pipe Callixtus the third and

389
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:08.260
those all charges against her.

390
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.380
When the news reached from Jane was elevated to a motto,

391
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.790
the 116 years of conflict and finally ended in 1493 and wore shattered.

392
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:19.900
France was in need of a national hero and in Joan they found one.

393
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.880
She's kind of remained there ever since.

394
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.720
On May the 16th 1920 pope benedict the 15th kind of Nice step.

395
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.380
Four days later the French parliament declared a national day and and run a fast

396
00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:32.920
forward to today and she is arguably more famous than Charles the seventh Henry

397
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:37.360
the fifth or any of the forgotten kings who fought and raged around SAP,

398
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.390
but there's more to Joan's legacy than just being remembered.

399
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.900
You can still see the effect that she had on the [inaudible] wells.

400
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.850
Historians think it's unlikely the channels,

401
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:48.280
the seventh would have won the hundred years war without June.

402
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.680
That means an English victory,
which is great,

403
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:54.520
isn't that sounds which haven't been no United French nation just think no.

404
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:56.260
France,
the French revolution,

405
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:59.620
which means no to Polian which essentially means new modern world.

406
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.310
Just pick at random,
there would be no metric system,
no Louisiana purchase,

407
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:07.510
no France to the Americans and the revolutionary wars,
the entire planet.

408
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.200
It was a completely different,
most Joan of arc,

409
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.500
divinely inspired and just it's a new did peasant girl whose belief was enough

410
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:18.550
to make her a warrior.
It really doesn't matter.
And how short,
19 years on earth,

411
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.630
Joe Navarro changed the weld in ways that even kings and emperors ready to she

412
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:27.340
man then born and nobody,
but she died Joan of arc,

413
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.600
the heroine of fronts.
So I already have you found that video.
