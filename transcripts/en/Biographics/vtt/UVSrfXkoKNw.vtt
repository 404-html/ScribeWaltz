00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Jim jones,</v>

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.990
<v Speaker 1>leader of the people's Temple has come to symbolize the ultimate in sleazy evil</v>

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>cults fingers through a forceful personality,</v>

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>charm and genuine good works.</v>

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>He managed to draw a massive following and lead them like a modern day Pied</v>

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Piper to the jungles of Guyana.</v>

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>There you promised them a modern day garden of Eden.</v>

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>What they found was confinement,</v>

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>mental and physical control and enforced suicide.</v>

10
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>In this week's by and graphics,</v>

11
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>we dive into the life of the Real Jim Jones.</v>

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>James Warren Jones was born on May the 13th 1931 to Lynn,</v>

13
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>NASA Putnam and Jim Jones Sr in Crete,</v>

14
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Indiana.</v>

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>The older Jim was a disabled war veteran,</v>

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>then NASA was some 15 years younger than her husband's and the marriage was not</v>

17
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>a happy one.</v>

18
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Jim was often away working on road crews,</v>

19
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>leaving NASA isolated and lonely increase.</v>

20
00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.791
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

21
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it certainly didn't help her cause though with our unsocial manner,</v>

22
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>she smoked cast and voiced have to use opinions at every opportunity and that's</v>

23
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>has never wanted to be a mother.</v>

25
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>The addition of a child to the family only increased the stress the drains were</v>

26
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>facing.</v>

27
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after the child's birth,</v>

28
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Jim suffered a complete nervous breakdown,</v>

29
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>unable to work any longer.</v>

30
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>The finances became dire leading to very eviction from the family farm.</v>

31
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>The homeless family were taken in by Jim's relatives and the small town of Lynn</v>

32
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>and Deana Lynn was a conservative orderly town with the vast majority of the</v>

33
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>townspeople being charged.</v>

34
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Guy With the town also has a prominence at Ku Klux Klan membership.</v>

35
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>The drones is lived in a derelict shack that lacked plumbing when young Jim</v>

36
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>began school at the age of six his mother took a factory job.</v>

37
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>This provided the child's with the freedom of before and after school to roam</v>

38
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>

39
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>He was a needy child.</v>

40
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified of his father finding it difficult to make friends.</v>

41
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>He spends a lot of time alone reading.</v>

42
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Often the challenge could be seen wandering around town looking disconsolate.</v>

43
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Elderly widows around town felt sympathy for the young Waif fans would invite</v>

44
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>him in for a piece of cake.</v>

45
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>The boy was so polite.</v>

46
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>He soon one the mover.</v>

47
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It was through one of these local matriarchs that Jim got his first exposure to</v>

48
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 1>religion by the way of the Church of Nazarene.</v>

49
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Jim was constantly attentive,</v>

50
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>even quoting scripture back to the elderly woman to his mother's ambivalence,</v>

51
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Jim began attending church with the old women.</v>

52
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>He hung on every word coming from the preachers mouth.</v>

53
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>He also showed an amazing ability to recite sermons and quote lengthly biblical</v>

54
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>verses,</v>

55
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>but Jim was not exclusively committed to the Church of Nazarene is natural</v>

56
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>inquisitiveness caused him to attend every denomination in town.</v>

57
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>During the week he would wander into the woods and prop himself up on the stump</v>

58
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>where he would proceed to do deliver fiery sermons of his own to the local</v>

59
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>forest animals.</v>

60
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>This was pretty far outside of the norm and it was just one reason why people</v>

61
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>would remember young Jim Jones as a weird kid.</v>

62
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>His great interest in religion led to an equally obsessive fascination with</v>

63
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

64
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>There were also other things that set Jim apart from the other kids in Lynn.</v>

65
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>He cries a lot and he also,</v>

66
00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>he swore 40 much he would also steal candy from the local store.</v>

67
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Further his odd religious obsession,</v>

68
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>let him you come out with all sorts of strange things such as that he was being</v>

69
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>held down by the angel of death.</v>

70
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>By the age of nine,</v>

71
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Jim was claiming 50 amps,</v>

72
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.263
<v Speaker 1>special powers.</v>

73
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>One's eight he climbs on a roof and cool down off everyone to watch him fly,</v>

74
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>catapulting himself from the roof.</v>

75
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>He promptly fell to the ground and break his arm.</v>

76
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.210
<v Speaker 1>About that same time Jim took see wandering around town and is collecting road</v>

77
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>kill in order to give each dead animal an elaborate funeral.</v>

78
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>The other kids looked onto this with a morbid fascination.</v>

79
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Jim was 10 years old when America and to the Second World War while all of his</v>

80
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>school mates spends their recess playing,</v>

81
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>there's marines or Gis.</v>

82
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>He insisted on playing the Nazis,</v>

83
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.870
<v Speaker 1>particularly their leader at all,</v>

84
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>fiddler with whom he was absolutely enraptured.</v>

85
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>He even went so far as recruiting younger children and telling them into mini</v>

86
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.844
<v Speaker 1>storm treaters.</v>

87
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>When they did not use step high enough,</v>

88
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>he would whack them with a twig.</v>

89
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.231
<v Speaker 1>What'd he became?</v>

90
00:03:59.231 --> 00:03:59.801
<v Speaker 1>A teenager.</v>

91
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Jim's new favorite topic changed from religion to sex.</v>

92
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>He established himself as the young peoples,</v>

93
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>all authority on the subject and we'd set up caught on his porch to teach the</v>

94
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>facts of life in my new to detail,</v>

95
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>to an eager audience.</v>

96
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>It's mother was happy for him to share his dbs knowledge,</v>

97
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but the parents of the other children,</v>

98
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>they were rather incensed at high school gym set himself apart,</v>

100
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>not just by his strange beliefs and by a strange actions,</v>

101
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>but also by his dress rather than the casual dress that was normal.</v>

102
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>He walked his Sunday best every single day.</v>

103
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>He also never spoke unless he instigated the conversation.</v>

104
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

105
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>he did love to engage as teachers in debates attempting to highlight his</v>

106
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>superior intellect.</v>

107
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.231
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

108
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>although not in any sense a talented sportsman,</v>

109
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Jim was an exceptional organize that at the age of 14 he established a baseball</v>

110
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>league.</v>

111
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>During one team meeting.</v>

112
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Some kids saw Jim drop a pattern dog from his loft to its death.</v>

113
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>After that it's the players.</v>

114
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 1>They became scared of him and the League fell apart.</v>

115
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.780
<v Speaker 1>By the early 1940 is Jim senior had become a hopeless alcoholic.</v>

116
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>His body was now ruined and as he had suffered a stroke that left him unable to</v>

117
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:06.154
<v Speaker 1>speak legibly.</v>

118
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Then that's a,</v>

119
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>took another man,</v>

120
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>a secrets that was not so secret in this small town.</v>

121
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably the marriage irrevocably broke apart and Jim and Lenexa were divorced</v>

122
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 1>in 1945 then NASA took Jim and his move to Richmond,</v>

123
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Indiana while attending high school gym works.</v>

124
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>The night shift as an the anthem read memorial hospital in December of 1948 he</v>

125
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>graduated with honors,</v>

126
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>which was quite an accomplishment for a 17 year olds who was also working a full</v>

127
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.623
<v Speaker 1>time job.</v>

128
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It was while working,</v>

129
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>it's read memorial that Jim met,</v>

130
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>courted and fell in love with a young nurse by the name of Marcellin Baldwin and</v>

131
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>was entranced by Jen who was four years her junior and it's the couple were</v>

132
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>married in 1949 together.</v>

133
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>They moved to Indianapolis,</v>

134
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Indiana in Bloomington.</v>

135
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Masalin founds work as a nurse.</v>

136
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.310
<v Speaker 1>While her husband attended Butler University.</v>

137
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>The couple they now found themselves living in the heart of Ku Klux Klan</v>

138
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

139
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>and it was in the midst of this redneck country that Jim developed a passion for</v>

140
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>two things,</v>

141
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>racial integration and socialism.</v>

142
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>In the spring of 1952 Jim accepted a position as student pastor read some</v>

143
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Methodist church.</v>

144
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>He excelled in the role and quickly set up a youth center,</v>

145
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>which was open to children of all faiths.</v>

146
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.860
<v Speaker 1>He seen recognize that the way to attract crowds ends,</v>

147
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>therefore to increase church donations,</v>

148
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>was to adopt a flamboyance Pentecostal style.</v>

149
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Men's make faith healing a central part of his performances.</v>

150
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>These performances began to gather wide your attention and before long he was</v>

151
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.480
<v Speaker 1>being invited to preach.</v>

152
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It's conventions and assemblies throughout Indiana and the surrounding states.</v>

153
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Regular services were held at Elmwood temple in Cincinnati,</v>

154
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>

155
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>where he would invite those suffering from ailments to come forward for the</v>

156
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>laying on of hands even traveled as far afield as Los Angeles to participate in</v>

157
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>a healing convention.</v>

158
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 1>By the Mid 1950s Jones was filling the churches with his dramatic healing</v>

159
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>sermons as each one.</v>

160
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>He insisted that the audience be completely integrators and the black members of</v>

161
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>the congregation sit up front facts,</v>

162
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>which further ingratiated him to local black people.</v>

163
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>It was his insistence on racial integration within his flock that lends it to a</v>

164
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>splits with Jim's church.</v>

165
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Employer should actually is in Indianapolis at the time,</v>

166
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>worked strictly segregated and Jim's allowance of blacks was causing real</v>

167
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

168
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>

169
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>he quit in disgust and set up his own community unity church.</v>

170
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>This soon morphed into wings of deliverance,</v>

171
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:35.891
<v Speaker 1>which was renamed in 1955 as the People's Temple Full Gospel Church</v>

172
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.940
<v Speaker 1>from the start.</v>

173
00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:45.810
<v Speaker 1>People's temple grew large crowds of both black and white parishioners.</v>

174
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.540
<v Speaker 1>The healing dramas web still the highlight of every sermon,</v>

175
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>but Jim's prime concern at to be building a truly racially integrated ministry</v>

176
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 1>in recognition of his efforts to achieve racial harmony.</v>

177
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Jim was appointed in 1960 by Indianapolis Mayor Charles Boswell.</v>

178
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.840
<v Speaker 1>The man has intended his role to be low profile,</v>

179
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:05.850
<v Speaker 1>but Jim immediately took to the limelight,</v>

180
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.780
<v Speaker 1>appearing on TV and radio programs dramatically proclaiming,</v>

181
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.730
<v Speaker 1>let my people go.</v>

182
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Jones threw himself into the civil rights movements.</v>

183
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Through his efforts of the churches,</v>

184
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.830
<v Speaker 1>restaurants,</v>

185
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.450
<v Speaker 1>amusement parks and movie theaters,</v>

186
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.860
<v Speaker 1>they were all integrated.</v>

187
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.850
<v Speaker 1>In 1961 Jim collapsed as a result of over exhaustion.</v>

188
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.220
<v Speaker 1>He was mistakenly taken to a black hospital,</v>

189
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.260
<v Speaker 1>but when the mistake was identified,</v>

190
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.460
<v Speaker 1>he refused to move.</v>

191
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.660
<v Speaker 1>He even took to making the beds and emptying the bedpans of sick black people in</v>

192
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:34.380
<v Speaker 1>the wards.</v>

193
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.580
<v Speaker 1>This caused publicity,</v>

194
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.750
<v Speaker 1>which directs and the led to pressure on hospital authorities to desegregate the</v>

195
00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:40.350
<v Speaker 1>wards.</v>

196
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

197
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.640
<v Speaker 1>not surprisingly,</v>

198
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 1>whites controlled churches and businesses were highly critical of this upstarts</v>

199
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:48.390
<v Speaker 1>preacher who debt to challenge the status quo,</v>

200
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.680
<v Speaker 1>thread swear received.</v>

201
00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:53.250
<v Speaker 1>A swastika was painted on the wall of the People's Temple Church building and to</v>

202
00:08:53.251 --> 00:08:53.491
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

203
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Cat was tossed at Jim's,</v>

204
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 1>if not the 1960s the drains is adopted.</v>

205
00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Three children of Korean descent.</v>

206
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Jim referred to these children as his rainbow family in an attempt to extend the</v>

207
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>rainbow family.</v>

208
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>He also encouraged members of his congregation to likewise adopt wat on</v>

209
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:10.224
<v Speaker 1>refugees.</v>

210
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Now in the early 1960s Jim,</v>

211
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>he became obsessed with the prospect of a nuclear holocaust.</v>

212
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>In December of 1961 he announced to his congregation that he had a prophetic</v>

213
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>dream in which the entire American Midwest had been destroyed in a nuclear</v>

214
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:25.930
<v Speaker 1>conflagration officer.</v>

215
00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Reasoning and magazine.</v>

216
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Ossicle insights holds nine places in the world to hide.</v>

217
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>He took his young family on a trip to one of them,</v>

218
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Belo Horizonte in Brazil.</v>

219
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>They stayed there for two years.</v>

220
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>During this time is distrust and personal hatred towards the governments of the</v>

221
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>United States intensified.</v>

222
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>He was convinced that American political and economic self interest had brought</v>

223
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>the world to the brink of destruction.</v>

224
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>The drains is returned to Indianapolis in December of 1963 Jim immediately made</v>

225
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>plans to move his congregation who had been waiting patiently for their leaders</v>

226
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>return to another of the nine safe places on the list.</v>

227
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Northern California.</v>

228
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of 1964 the family along with about 140 congregants moved to the</v>

229
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>town of Ukiah in the Redwood Valley area above San Francisco.</v>

230
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Over the next few months,</v>

231
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>church services were held in rented church buildings and then as a rancher</v>

232
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Ridgewood throughout the week.</v>

233
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Jim worked as a high school teacher.</v>

234
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>After three years of steadily building up its membership for peoples temple was</v>

235
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 1>grounded official standing by the Christian Church Disciples of Christ,</v>

236
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:25.681
<v Speaker 1>northern California,</v>

237
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Nevada region in 1968 the following February,</v>

238
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.280
<v Speaker 1>the people's Temple,</v>

239
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Redwood Valley Complex Open,</v>

240
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>the complex included the Jones home.</v>

241
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 1>They swimming Pol Childcare Center,</v>

242
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 1>old folks homes,</v>

243
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the temple meeting place,</v>

244
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.394
<v Speaker 1>and a ranch.</v>

245
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.270
<v Speaker 1>All of this of course was completely integrators.</v>

246
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>This let's all garden of Eden sat in the middle of a strictly segregated Redwood</v>

247
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Valley.</v>

248
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Within a year,</v>

249
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the people's Temple had expanded into San Francisco.</v>

250
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Buses were put onto transport new parishioners there to Redwood Valley for</v>

251
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>weekend services.</v>

252
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Jim also took to the road by bus touring from one city to the next,</v>

253
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.270
<v Speaker 1>winning new converts in each place,</v>

254
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>many of which were so captivated by the charismatic preacher that they moved to</v>

255
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>the Redwood Valley ranch.</v>

256
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.150
<v Speaker 1>People's Temple experienced rapid expansion during the 1970s.</v>

257
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.660
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

258
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it was also during this time that the church received its first negative media</v>

259
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:19.460
<v Speaker 1>coverage.</v>

260
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.540
<v Speaker 1>A series of articles in the San Francisco Examiner profiled the church painting</v>

261
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Jones as a false messiah who would claim to bring 43 people back from the debt</v>

262
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.570
<v Speaker 1>if the authority structure,</v>

263
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:30.530
<v Speaker 1>all of the judge was,</v>

264
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:30.891
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>

265
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:31.940
<v Speaker 1>put times of the spotlight,</v>

266
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.030
<v Speaker 1>the examiner articles drew the interest of,</v>

267
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.281
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

268
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:35.180
<v Speaker 1>media outlets.</v>

269
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:35.871
<v Speaker 1>From then on,</v>

270
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:40.871
<v Speaker 1>James came to view the media as the enemy and agents of the devil himself.</v>

271
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Things got worse when in 1973 h prominent members of the people's Temple</v>

272
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.150
<v Speaker 1>defected stories,</v>

273
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 1>image to financial abuse,</v>

274
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:48.411
<v Speaker 1>mind controlled,</v>

275
00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:51.860
<v Speaker 1>and tax evasion in response to the pressure of brought upon the church by the</v>

276
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:53.100
<v Speaker 1>media in the defectors,</v>

277
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Jim first proposed the idea of mass suicide.</v>

278
00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Such a grandes action would establish the congregants is Matas and shame those</v>

279
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>who were out to get them.</v>

280
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.801
<v Speaker 1>As for how,</v>

281
00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>however Jones his words when nothing more than bluster.</v>

282
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 1>It was during the summer of 1973 that Jones made the decision to relocate the</v>

283
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>people's Temple to the South American country of Guyana.</v>

284
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.103
<v Speaker 1>Two months later,</v>

285
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 1>he visited the country in order to open negotiations to purchase 27,000 acres of</v>

286
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>lands in the Matthew Ridge area near the Venezuelan border.</v>

287
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>The guy and he is cooperative.</v>

288
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Republic was a socialist country and for Jones he would pass through on his</v>

289
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 1>return trip from Brazil in 1963 it was an ideal haven.</v>

290
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 1>The first peoples temple members arrived in Guyana in March of 1974 to begin the</v>

291
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 1>mammoth task of clearing the jungle and breaking grounds for construction on</v>

292
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 1>what was to become Jonestown.</v>

293
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Later there were 50 people's Temple Pine is in Guyana Day and night.</v>

295
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>They worked to construct buildings and establish a massive agricultural</v>

296
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:50.944
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>

297
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>By 1977 Jamestown was an established community,</v>

298
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>but things were getting worse.</v>

299
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Back in California.</v>

300
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 1>On Memorial Day 1977 along with 600 congregation members,</v>

301
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Jones made an appearance at a commemoration for suicides who had jumped off San</v>

302
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Golden Gate Bridge in his address on this day.</v>

303
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 1>He declared I have been in a suicidal mood myself today,</v>

304
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.330
<v Speaker 1>so I have personal empathy for what we are doing here today.</v>

305
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.981
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

306
00:13:16.981 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 1>there was renewed pressure on the church from the American media on August the</v>

307
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 1>first 1977 and also appeared in new West magazine.</v>

308
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's alleged that members had been beaten,</v>

309
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>the church was rife with financial miss dealings and that Jim Jones was nothing</v>

310
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>more than a charlatan.</v>

311
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>By the time the article hit the new standards,</v>

312
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>James was already in Guyana.</v>

313
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>By September.</v>

314
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>There were more than a thousand peoples temple members in Guyana with only about</v>

315
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>50 or so left in the United States.</v>

316
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 1>The sudden influx of people placed severe strain on the facilities at Jonestown.</v>

317
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.730
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

318
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>members enthusiastically pitched into extends the village in order to</v>

319
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 1>accommodate the demand.</v>

320
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Three quarters of the transplanted residents were black with the remainder being</v>

321
00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

322
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Hispanic,</v>

323
00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.591
<v Speaker 1>Asian,</v>

324
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 1>and native American.</v>

325
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>The task of feeding housing and clothing the community.</v>

326
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a massive undertaking,</v>

327
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 1>but the temple members found a great sense of pride in the feet that they were</v>

328
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing a utopian heaven on earth.</v>

329
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Despite the harsh conditions and the hard work,</v>

330
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>the people appeared in those first few months to be genuinely happy.</v>

331
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Back in California at former members began a concerted attack on the people's</v>

332
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Temple.</v>

333
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.270
<v Speaker 1>A woman who had born a child to Jane's sued for custody of the child's,</v>

334
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 1>which was living at the commune.</v>

335
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Joan's refuse to even consider giving up.</v>

336
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The child's declaring that any attempt to do take the child,</v>

337
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 1>we'd put the life of every member of the people's Temple in jeopardy.</v>

338
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Still other defectors who had left children behind.</v>

339
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Also sued for custody following vis a declaration of human rights violations</v>

340
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>committed by people's Temple,</v>

341
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 1>well issued by defectors to the media.</v>

342
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.011
<v Speaker 1>It's included.</v>

343
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 1>The assertion that rehearsals from our suicide often took place at people's</v>

344
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Temple,</v>

345
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 1>a committee of concerned relatives that Jonestown was ms or more than a</v>

346
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp with armed guards constantly patrolling and the residents</v>

347
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 1>continually subjected to brainwashing forced labor and sleep deprivation.</v>

348
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Attempts were made to pressure Congress to establish an official investigation</v>

349
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:06.164
<v Speaker 1>of Jones down.</v>

350
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.550
<v Speaker 1>The challenge was taken up by Congressman Leo Ryan representing the San Mateo</v>

351
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>district of Northern California.</v>

352
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Ryan had determined to lead a fact finding mission to Jonestown in order to find</v>

353
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 1>out firsthand what was going on that with reporters and relatives in tow,</v>

354
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 1>he flew into the APP or is it nearby Georgetown?</v>

355
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.240
<v Speaker 1>On November the 15th 1978 two days later,</v>

356
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 1>they flew to the airstrip at criteria and then we're driven by limousine into</v>

357
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:34.670
<v Speaker 1>the jungle towards Jamestown dreams had been repairing the temple members for</v>

358
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:36.380
<v Speaker 1>the congressman's visit for weeks.</v>

359
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Every member knew that God's were watching their every move.</v>

360
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.310
<v Speaker 1>They were commanded to portray a glorious Utopian society.</v>

361
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Players were conducted in which the members were told exactly what to say when</v>

362
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 1>spoken to you by reporters.</v>

363
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Any signs of dissatisfaction would be harshly dealt with away from prying eyes.</v>

364
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.360
<v Speaker 1>The congressman was warmly welcomed into reception,</v>

365
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 1>was held that first night.</v>

366
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Ryan seems genuine.</v>

367
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.850
<v Speaker 1>The impressed with the organization and the order that he saw,</v>

368
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.560
<v Speaker 1>but late into the night one of the reporters who would come along with him was</v>

369
00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>secretly passed a note from a man in the crowd,</v>

370
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>the man he wanted to leave with the congressmen.</v>

371
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.150
<v Speaker 1>The next morning he report it,</v>

372
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.430
<v Speaker 1>showed the note to the congressman.</v>

373
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Ryan brought the issue up with Jones who declared that anyone was free to come</v>

374
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:18.320
<v Speaker 1>or go as they pleased.</v>

375
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 1>There's prompted Ryan's.</v>

376
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 1>You make a public declaration.</v>

377
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:21.110
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

378
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 1>anyone you wanted to leave with him at the end of the weekends was most welcome.</v>

379
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Over that weekends,</v>

380
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:26.870
<v Speaker 1>many people came forward.</v>

381
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Then on the afternoon of the second day of the visit or people's Temple member</v>

382
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:32.570
<v Speaker 1>lunged at Congressman Ryan with a knife.</v>

383
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 1>This event soured the proceedings and the visitors were intends on getting out</v>

384
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:37.790
<v Speaker 1>as fast as possible.</v>

385
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.340
<v Speaker 1>When the Congressmen's party left,</v>

386
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.620
<v Speaker 1>there were 14 people's temple members with them.</v>

387
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.650
<v Speaker 1>They got into two trucks and were driven back to the ass strep.</v>

388
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.151
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

389
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:53.880
<v Speaker 1>the almost immediately after they left dreads orders and the tractor and trailer</v>

<v Speaker 1>man's by armed body guards to follow them.</v>

391
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Just as the congressman reporters and evacuees were about to board the plane and</v>

392
00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:01.350
<v Speaker 1>head back to the safety of the United States,</v>

393
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the truck and tractor rolled onto the airstrip.</v>

394
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.650
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point for Jones has God's immediately opens fire with sub machine</v>

395
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:08.190

396
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Congressman Ryan and four others were killed.</v>

397
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Then one of the supposed to defectors pulled out a handgun and began shooting at</v>

398
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:17.130
<v Speaker 1>those who had already made their way onto one of the two waiting planes.</v>

399
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.910
<v Speaker 1>The leader of the killer guards immediately radioed back to Jones and told them</v>

400
00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 1>that the congressman was dead.</v>

401
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point,</v>

402
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.430
<v Speaker 1>the drains immediately began talking to his followers over a loudspeaker system.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He told them that the congressman had been killed and as a results,</v>

404
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.600

405
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 1>who we had been looking to you for salvation would no longer take them in with</v>

406
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:37.680
<v Speaker 1>the Americans went out certain descend in armed forces to annihilate the</v>

407
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:38.514
<v Speaker 1>people's Temple.</v>

408
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.210
<v Speaker 1>He drive fear into his followers by telling them Americans would torture their</v>

<v Speaker 1>and it's brutalize their old people.</v>

412
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.170
<v Speaker 1>The only dignified response he said was to commit mass revolutionary.</v>

413
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.080
<v Speaker 2>We didn't give it to die.</v>

414

418
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:06.690
<v Speaker 1>protest.</v>

419
