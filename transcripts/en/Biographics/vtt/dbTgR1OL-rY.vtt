00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:01.364
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson.</v>

3
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.151
<v Speaker 1>is there anything,</v>

5
00:00:02.151 --> 00:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't do high school dropouts at the age of 16 he started companies.</v>

6
00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>He's seen the wells and he has more adventures than anyone could dream of in a</v>

7
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:10.694
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

8
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a creative personality and a brilliant businessmen as well as being an</v>

9
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>energetic charitable man who has built a brand,</v>

10
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>a recognizable around the world.</v>

11
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I Adams,</v>

12
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.761
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

13
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 1>he's also worth nearly $5 billion.</v>

14
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>So how exactly did Branson gets to where he is today?</v>

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's start at the beginning of the 1950s in,</v>

16
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

17
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>England's Branson was born at the eldest son of Edward and Eve Branson,</v>

18
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer and a flight attendance.</v>

19
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Though she was a flight attendant,</v>

20
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Eve Branson didn't sit idly by on their days off.</v>

21
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>She built a wooden trash cans and tissue boxes selling them for extra money for</v>

22
00:00:58.741 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>the family.</v>

23
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Watching his mother's success builds Branson's admiration for entrepreneurs and</v>

24
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>gave them an option for when school just wasn't working out.</v>

25
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>She was always supportive of him and was even known to tell people he would one</v>

26
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>day be prime minister of England.</v>

27
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>His mother was also an influence on Branson's active minds and his lifestyle</v>

28
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>that have become so much a part of his international brand today.</v>

29
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>She didn't let her children watch TV.</v>

30
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Instead of pushing her son and two daughters outside to entertain themselves and</v>

31
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>make themselves useful though clearly brilliant.</v>

32
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Branson was not a successful students who have dyslexia and growing up school.</v>

33
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>That was difficult for him,</v>

34
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but this Lexia did not stop him and now he credits it as a key part of his</v>

35
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>formula for success.</v>

36
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>If you have a learning disability,</v>

37
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you become a very good delegator because you know what your weaknesses are and</v>

38
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what your strengths are and you make sure that you find great people to</v>

39
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>step in and deal with your weaknesses.</v>

40
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>He moved through several schools as a child,</v>

41
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>eventually giving up on institutionalized learning at the age of 16 but he did</v>

42
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>not give up on achieving.</v>

43
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>When he dropped out of school,</v>

44
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>he already knew that being an entrepreneur that was the right life for him.</v>

45
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>He started out with an idea and it's with an ultimate goal far beyond just</v>

46
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>earning money.</v>

47
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>From my very first day as an entrepreneur,</v>

48
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I felt the only mission worth pursuing in business is to make people's lives</v>

49
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:14.934
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

50
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>His first venture as a teenage businessmen who was publishing a magazine called</v>

51
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

52
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I took me 16 years old with no input or work for anyone but students.</v>

53
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Ranson was able to secure $8,000 in advertising for the magazines.</v>

54
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:28.134
<v Speaker 1>First issue,</v>

55
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 1>this was 1966 and $8,000 was a lot more money them so much in fact that Branson</v>

56
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have to sell the first issue.</v>

57
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.811
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

58
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>he gave away 50,000 copies,</v>

59
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>building the brand's name,</v>

60
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Andy,</v>

61
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>potentially loyal customer base for future issues.</v>

62
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It was the first demonstration of a brilliant business mind with an utterly</v>

63
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>impressive talent for marketing students.</v>

64
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>It continued in its original form for three years,</v>

65
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>but in 1969 Branson,</v>

66
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>he felt the urge to make it even bigger and to take it in a new direction.</v>

67
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Advertisements for records were a large part of the magazine's revenue,</v>

68
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>so Branson took records and the magazine and put them together.</v>

69
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.591
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

70
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>he spotted a gap in the market for mail order record.</v>

71
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Sales,</v>

72
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>his man order business when it was Christians with a name that we all know today</v>

73
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>and that would be virgin,</v>

74
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't actually Richard Branson who came up with that name.</v>

75
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>It was one of his first employees.</v>

76
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Though they were successful,</v>

77
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>the name was perfect for the company.</v>

78
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>As all of the young people involved in this,</v>

79
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>when you to business,</v>

80
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.413
<v Speaker 1>well that name,</v>

81
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it obviously stuck and to now it's come to wrap present much more than just mail</v>

82
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>order music though the mail order business.</v>

83
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It was popular,</v>

84
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't making enough money to stay afloat and Branson when he needed cash,</v>

85
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>he decided that the best way to do that was avoided giving the government of the</v>

86
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>entire share of the taxes that he actually owed.</v>

87
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You cannot with a scheme through which he avoided reporting all of the records</v>

88
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>that were sold in the UK falsifying the numbers of those that were exported.</v>

89
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It sounded good and it did bring in cash birth.</v>

90
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Well it was discovered and we actually ended up in jail and having to pay over</v>

91
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>$60,000 in fines.</v>

92
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>This obstacle and a short time in jail didn't slow him or his business ambitions</v>

93
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.454
<v Speaker 1>down though,</v>

94
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>even with the tax fraud scandal,</v>

95
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it was only less than two years after starting the man or the record business</v>

96
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that Branson was able to take yet another leap in 1971 he opens an actual bricks</v>

97
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>and mortar store in order to sell records.</v>

98
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Then it was only a year before he bought himself a high in and was able to build</v>

99
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>a recording studio in [inaudible].</v>

100
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Now that he had a studio,</v>

101
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>the next logical step,</v>

102
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it was to start a record label.</v>

103
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So he looked around and ended up signing an artist he thought would be okay,</v>

104
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>but not likely to have overwhelming success as no one else would take him on.</v>

105
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And so what was the name of this newly created record label?</v>

106
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>But of course it was a virgin records.</v>

107
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>The label had success almost immediately with its first artist,</v>

108
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Mike Oldfield staying on the chance with the album tubular bells for nearly five</v>

109
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.944
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

110
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>To put this in perspective.</v>

111
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>The record was on the charts as along as it took from Branson to go from selling</v>

112
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>records by mail to having his own record label.</v>

113
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>The success of Oldfield and Branson under the upstart virgin ladle bit didn't go</v>

114
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>unnoticed far from it.</v>

115
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Huge names like the sex pistols,</v>

116
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>the rolling stones culture club,</v>

117
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Janet Jackson and Genesis.</v>

118
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>They were all later signed onto the label.</v>

119
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:12.754
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>drown the 1970s while Bronson was in his twenties he focused on his ever-growing</v>

121
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 1>music business,</v>

122
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 1>but by 1984 he was again itching to try something new,</v>

123
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>so he took what seems like a pretty large jump across industries.</v>

124
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>He invested in a new airline business before launching the full fledged airline</v>

125
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

126
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Branson had realized the potential for doing so when his own flights to the</v>

127
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 1>British Virgin Islands was canceled being wealthy.</v>

128
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to wait around.</v>

129
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>There's an APP or for the next flight at the whim of the airlines,</v>

130
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.260
<v Speaker 1>he could charter his own plane.</v>

131
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.280
<v Speaker 1>So he did it,</v>

132
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't keep the launch plan to himself.</v>

133
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

134
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>he charged the others.</v>

135
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to be on his original flight to the British Virgin Islands,</v>

136
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>a smaller fee and they all flew together on a chartered plane down to the island</v>

137
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>is creative minds and business intuition.</v>

138
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>They saw an opportunity here and Branson,</v>

139
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>well he was ready to seize it.</v>

140
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Soon after his initial experimental charter flight to the British Virgin</v>

141
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Islands,</v>

142
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>he called up Boeing and ask what they had for sale while they said that they had</v>

143
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>a Boeing seven four seven available lands,</v>

144
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.621
<v Speaker 1>Branson bought it and this was the start of his fleet of airplanes as he has</v>

145
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>with the man or to record business.</v>

146
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Branson's saw a need and a way that he could run a business better than others</v>

147
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>who were currently doing so.</v>

148
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>So Entry Richard Branson style.</v>

149
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>They did just that.</v>

150
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>We just made it that much more special than the other airlines we were competing</v>

151
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

152
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>He says of what he achieved with Virgin Atlantic Airways.</v>

153
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Long before it was the norm,</v>

154
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>virgin was offering such luxuries as individual TV screens to help people pass</v>

155
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>the time on flights.</v>

156
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.361
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

157
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Initially virgin it operates is only out of London's Gatwick Airport,</v>

158
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>but by 1991 it had grown to the point where it was given permission to fly out</v>

159
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>of Heathrow British Airways.</v>

160
00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

161
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>they were not say pleased by this new threats to their previously unchallenged</v>

162
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.310
<v Speaker 1>supremacy and they certainly did not sit idly by while virgin kept gobbling off</v>

163
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:10.694
<v Speaker 1>the market show.</v>

164
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.280
<v Speaker 1>In 1993 virgin is accused of British Airways of he's so cool.</v>

165
00:07:14.281 --> 00:07:19.281
<v Speaker 1>Series of dirty tricks that ranged from computer hacking to reliable following</v>

166
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:20.361
<v Speaker 1>the accusations,</v>

167
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:21.051
<v Speaker 1>British Airways,</v>

168
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 1>they settled over at nearly $4 million in legal fees and compensation.</v>

169
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.391
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>

170
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:26.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

171
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>what did Branson do with the money that he received in the settlements?</v>

172
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>he didn't just stick it all in his own bank accounts.</v>

174
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Instead he decided to share it with virgin is employees now they the settlement.</v>

175
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It was a win for the company.</v>

176
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.450
<v Speaker 1>It didn't mean virgin and Branson were completely successful and just had</v>

177
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>nothing to worry about us.</v>

178
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.281
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>

179
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

180
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Branson was unfortunately forced to sell his music business in order to keep his</v>

181
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:48.284
<v Speaker 1>empire going.</v>

182
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Emi.</v>

183
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>They bought virgin records in 1992 and although it was a good business decision,</v>

184
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>it was a tough personal choice for Branson.</v>

185
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.893
<v Speaker 1>The music business,</v>

186
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>it was Branson's baby,</v>

187
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>it was his first venture and he was the reason everything else he had built was</v>

188
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

189
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.471
<v Speaker 1>Over the years,</v>

190
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>he's been very open about just how difficult that sale was for him.</v>

191
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

192
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>you build something from scratch.</v>

193
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 1>We had just signed Janet Jackson,</v>

194
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>we had signed the rolling stones when we sold it and I remember running down</v>

195
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Ladbroke grove tears streaming down my face with a check for $1 billion.</v>

196
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Since the sale,</v>

197
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Virgin Airlines has continued to grow brands,</v>

198
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.621
<v Speaker 1>so now today,</v>

199
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>cell phone sector to his business and then a space travel venture called a</v>

200
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>virgin galactic.</v>

201
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>500 people have bought tickets,</v>

202
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 1>have an as yet unscheduled flight into space with Virgin Galactic.</v>

203
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.411
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>

204
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson owns 200 companies linked to the virgin brands,</v>

205
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but well business,</v>

206
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not his only interest and nor is it his own</v>

207
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Branson.</v>

208
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.190
<v Speaker 1>He could just sit comfortably in his island,</v>

209
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>resort home.</v>

210
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:56.791
<v Speaker 1>That's well,</v>

211
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>he prefers to explore all corners of the welds and to do so in ways far more</v>

212
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 1>interesting and it's far more powerless than in the comfort of a Virgin Atlantic</v>

213
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>plane.</v>

214
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>He's flashy than your average billionaire with no qualms about risking his life</v>

215
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>and the pursuit of adventure adventure that also serves double duty as he can</v>

216
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>beat the out of the box marketing strategy.</v>

217
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>He makes no distinction between his professional lens,</v>

218
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>personal endeavors,</v>

219
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>simply aiming to enjoy life and it's making a difference where he can.</v>

220
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of work as work and to play as play.</v>

221
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It's all living well.</v>

222
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>In 1985 Richard Branson made international news when he tried to set a world</v>

223
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>record for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic.</v>

224
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>They failed in totally spectacular fashion as his boat capsized and he had to be</v>

225
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>rescued by eight British military helicopter.</v>

226
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.831
<v Speaker 1>Is that of this?</v>

227
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Do not be embarrassed by your failures.</v>

228
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Learn from them and start again as well.</v>

229
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Again in Branson's true form here,</v>

230
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.521
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

231
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Desk.</v>

232
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>In 1986 he attempted to the Atlantic crossing again,</v>

233
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>but this time he succeeded in spectacular fashion.</v>

234
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>He broke the world record for the crossing by over two hours.</v>

235
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 1>But breaking this record,</v>

236
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

237
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't enough for Branson.</v>

238
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:07.560
<v Speaker 1>He wanted more adventure and he also wants to keep his name and the virgin his</v>

239
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>name in the news.</v>

240
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't a water crossing,</v>

241
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>but now we wanted to move on to our airplanes.</v>

242
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>They were not exciting enough,</v>

243
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>so we opted to cross the Atlantic in a hot air balloon and then,</v>

244
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean crossing the Atlantic,</v>

245
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:19.891
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't enough.</v>

246
00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>So he decided to cross the Pacific in a hot air balloon.</v>

247
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Now it wasn't all purely for the pursuit of adventure that he took on these hot</v>

248
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 1>air balloon challenges actually truly enjoy traveling by hot air balloon.</v>

249
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.520
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

250
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.730
<v Speaker 1>my favorite mode of transport is hot air ballooning.</v>

251
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's so graceful to be blown by the winds to go where the wind takes you.</v>

252
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Now the balloon Branson took on his first flight.</v>

253
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a record breaker in and of itself.</v>

254
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 1>It was the size of a 21 looks story building and it was built to fly to speed of</v>

255
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 1>over 200 miles per hour.</v>

256
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.220
<v Speaker 1>It was simply the largest and the fastest balloon ever constructed,</v>

257
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.001
<v Speaker 1>large and vast.</v>

258
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make that balloon immune from danger.</v>

259
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.540
<v Speaker 1>The flights path was from the state of Maine to islands as when the balloon</v>

260
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.321
<v Speaker 1>reached islands.</v>

261
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It didn't attach as it was supposed to.</v>

262
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

263
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Branson and his crew found themselves dipping into the freezing waters of the</v>

264
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic.</v>

265
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>His crew jumped out of the balloon,</v>

266
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but Branson was forced to stay put after the balloon rapidly lifted to 12,000</v>

267
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:15.840
<v Speaker 1>feet with him still in us terrified,</v>

268
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but able to remain calm.</v>

269
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Ranson navigated the balloon back down towards the water and jumped into the</v>

270
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:21.571
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

271
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>When he saw her,</v>

272
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>he was just a few dozen feet above its surface and now let's move on to the</v>

273
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Pacific blue trip because this wasn't much calmer.</v>

274
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 1>They ran out of most of their fuel partway through and they were dependent on</v>

275
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>the jet stream to simply push them forward.</v>

276
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.133
<v Speaker 1>Branson said,</v>

277
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I was facing almost certain death we could have just slumped on the floor and</v>

278
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 1>accepted our face or try to fly the balloon into the core of the jet stream and</v>

279
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 1>finds the strongest winds you can find.</v>

280
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Stay awake for three days and do everything you can to avoid what on paper looks</v>

281
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 1>like a sad ending Branson's crew.</v>

282
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

283
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 1>they chose to stay away.</v>

284
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 1>You can do what they could and as they overcame that challenge,</v>

285
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.150
<v Speaker 1>they didn't break the records they hope to,</v>

286
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>but they did live to tell the town of their adventure and that was all they</v>

287
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:00.941
<v Speaker 1>could have asked for it.</v>

288
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

289
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.893
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

290
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 2>School Amanda,</v>

291
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.020
<v Speaker 1>like Branson who devotes much of his life to the pursuit of pleasure,</v>

292
00:12:15.021 --> 00:12:18.770
<v Speaker 1>rent growing your business might seem to be pretty full up on time commitments,</v>

293
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.701
<v Speaker 1>but for Branson,</v>

294
00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:20.960
<v Speaker 1>business and success,</v>

295
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.660
<v Speaker 1>it's about much more than just amassing wealth.</v>

296
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.190
<v Speaker 1>It's about helping people.</v>

297
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I never started out in business to make money.</v>

298
00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to create products that made a difference in people's lives.</v>

299
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The same is true today in my opinion.</v>

300
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.180
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing quite like the gift of giving.</v>

301
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.490
<v Speaker 1>When you see firsthand the impacts it can have,</v>

302
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.340
<v Speaker 1>it becomes the best feeling in the world.</v>

303
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Branson has used not only his money,</v>

304
00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but his brands in his new sobriety to influence world leaders.</v>

305
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.890
<v Speaker 1>He and Peter Gabriel of the virgin records span genesis talk to Nelson Mandela</v>

306
00:12:49.891 --> 00:12:53.150
<v Speaker 1>or about their dream of having a group of world leaders for them to work on the</v>

307
00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:55.550
<v Speaker 1>pressing issues facing the people of the world.</v>

308
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

309
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.020
<v Speaker 1>what was the result of that?</v>

310
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that would be the group,</v>

312
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.821
<v Speaker 1>the elders,</v>

313
00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:01.490
<v Speaker 1>a group of some of the world's most respected former leaders,</v>

314
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 1>including UN officials,</v>

315
00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:05.150
<v Speaker 1>president Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu,</v>

316
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.051
<v Speaker 1>Branson.</v>

317
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:08.270
<v Speaker 1>He does provide funding for the group and its initiatives,</v>

318
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.080
<v Speaker 1>but it was really his initial idea and his willingness to Karen's have those</v>

319
00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:15.020
<v Speaker 1>initial conversations that really made this all possible.</v>

320
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And then we come to environmental issues,</v>

321
00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:18.800
<v Speaker 1>which are one of Branson's personal passions.</v>

322
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.230
<v Speaker 1>He's committed to hundreds of millions of pounds to fighting global warming and</v>

323
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:26.120
<v Speaker 1>to even hosted a summit at his private island in 2009 they might have the</v>

324
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:26.570
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

325
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.630
<v Speaker 1>why does Richard Branson care about preserving the earth and its beauty quite</v>

326
00:13:29.631 --> 00:13:30.260
<v Speaker 1>some much?</v>

327
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

328
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.640
<v Speaker 1>like as creative beds,</v>

329
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Branson credits his childhood home and the amount of time he spent playing</v>

330
00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:35.750
<v Speaker 1>outside of this.</v>

331
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I was fortunate to have been brought up in the countryside in a little cottage.</v>

332
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that the first 10 years of my life were spent in the countryside,</v>

333
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.250
<v Speaker 1>biking,</v>

334
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.120
<v Speaker 1>climbing trees,</v>

335
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.320
<v Speaker 1>and didn't touch with nature.</v>

336
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's where my enough of nature started.</v>

337
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.561
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>

338
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.780
<v Speaker 1>he's worked with dozens of charities in his life,</v>

339
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.500
<v Speaker 1>dedicating his time and his money to the causes that he cares most about.</v>

340
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.960
<v Speaker 1>The United Nations has even recognized his efforts,</v>

341
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.160
<v Speaker 1>giving him the citizen of the world award in 2007 most recently,</v>

342
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Branson has thrown his charitable energy towards helping the Caribbean islands</v>

343
00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:09.080
<v Speaker 1>rebuild in the wake of Hurricane Irma is destruction during the fall of 2017</v>

344
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.960
<v Speaker 1>with his home on Necker island in the British Virgin Islands.</v>

345
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>He has a personal interest in doing so,</v>

346
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's gone well beyond just rebuilding his own luxurious home.</v>

347
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.690
<v Speaker 1>He spent time helping mobilize rescue efforts and assisting with the</v>

348
00:14:20.691 --> 00:14:22.280
<v Speaker 1>distribution of water and supplies,</v>

349
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.260
<v Speaker 1>as well as helping people find shelter.</v>

350
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>

351
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Branson is not a man to stand idly by when there is a need or opportunity.</v>

352
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

353
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>In promoting the virgin brands and promoting the courses he cares about.</v>

354
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Branson has become a highly recognizable personality and a frequent guest on</v>

355
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 1>news and other shows,</v>

356
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't always stick to the serious stuff he's made in the bond film.</v>

357
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Casino Royale and cement to displace isn't nineties icon.</v>

358
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>When he started on both Baywatch and friends,</v>

359
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 1>he was also featured in the iconic apple think different towns alongside such</v>

360

<v Speaker 1>luminaries as John Lennon.</v>

361
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Gandy Einstein and public [inaudible] Richard Branson.</v>

362
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 1>He's not your typical uptake businessmen.</v>

363
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a creative luminary who was impacted all the corners of business and</v>

364
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>impacted many parts of the world and that's what he aims to do.</v>

365
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Each day he wants to put the things he's passionate about to work for himself</v>

366
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>and for the world.</v>

367
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 1>A passionate belief in your business and personal objectives can make all the</v>

368
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:27.470
<v Speaker 1>difference between success and failure if you aren't proud of what you're doing.</v>

369
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Why should anybody else there?</v>

370
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Amid everything Branson,</v>

371
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>there's also found time to marry and have children.</v>

372
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 1>His first marriage was in the heyday of virgin records when he went to Kristin</v>

373
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:49.800
<v Speaker 1>to Massey in 1972 that marriage blessed him don't be seven years and the couple</v>

374
00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:54.360
<v Speaker 1>of divorced in 1979 Branson had already met his second wife Templeman.</v>

375
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>By the time he and Tom Massey divorced and his grandson admitted as much later</v>

376
00:15:58.011 --> 00:15:58.844
<v Speaker 1>to piers Morgan,</v>

377
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 1>he had a daughter with Templeman in 1979 sadly,</v>

378
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm Charlie lived for only four days.</v>

379
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until 10 years and two more children later that Branson and Templeman</v>

380
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.630
<v Speaker 1>actually tied the knot.</v>

381
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson.</v>

382
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 1>He could have continued to struggle through high school doing things he hated</v>

383
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 1>and that he didn't care about.</v>

384
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>He could have fought his way to becoming a lawyer like his dad or settling into</v>

385
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:31.160
<v Speaker 1>a middle class office job in London or the surrounding area.</v>

386
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 1>He could have stuck it out,</v>

387
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 1>but he listened to his instincts and he went with his heart,</v>

388
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 1>a drop house.</v>

389
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.170
<v Speaker 1>He could have fallen to the bottom and struggled through life,</v>

390
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 1>feeling sorry for himself,</v>

391
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 1>for having a learning disability,</v>

392
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's passion and his personality along with his mother's constant</v>

393
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>encouragement propelled him forward.</v>

394
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson drew on his creativity,</v>

395
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 1>took risks and never shied from a challenge.</v>

396
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Every time he failed you brushed himself off and try it again.</v>

397
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.380
<v Speaker 1>He gives back to a wells that has given him much and he continues to succeed as</v>

398
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:03.200
<v Speaker 1>a businessman and as an admired personality.</v>

399
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson once said that if you want to stand out from the crowd,</v>

400
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 1>give people a reason not to forget you.</v>

401

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

403
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.890
<v Speaker 1>he clearly follows his own advice and this has led him to a successful and</v>

404
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.830
<v Speaker 1>passionate life.</v>
