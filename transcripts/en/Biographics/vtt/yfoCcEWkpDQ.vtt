21
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>They were married with a union lasting for just two years.</v>

22
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>They proved to be torturous.</v>

23
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>He is for the infant.</v>

24
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>He was often recall in later life how his stepfather mistreated him.</v>

25
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>When the marriage was dissolved,</v>

26
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Vernon was taken in by his maternal grandmother,</v>

27
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Elaine Clark.</v>

28
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He grew into a likable,</v>

29
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but Mr Rothschild,</v>

30
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>who was highly active.</v>

31
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.941
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

32
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>he was given the nickname sputnik due to his boundless energy in recognition of</v>

33
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet satellite by age six,</v>

34
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Vernon was taken back in with his mother.</v>

35
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Bonnie has just married a man by the name of Roy,</v>

36
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>held a man when he moved in with his mother,</v>

37
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>she was pregnant again,</v>

38
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and in 1966 she gave birth to Vernon's.</v>

39
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 1>His younger brother,</v>

40
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Ron Vernon,</v>

41
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>struggled in school,</v>

42
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.030
<v Speaker 1>unable to keep up in elementary school to the extent that he was placed in a</v>

43
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>remedial class.</v>

44
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>The other kids in his school soon had a nickname for him.</v>

45
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Mr Retardo,</v>

46
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>

47
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Vernon recalls the effects that this ostracism has on his self esteem.</v>

48
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean your,</v>

49
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>here comes the retarded kids and it's like I stopped in my tracks.</v>

51
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It is believed that one of the main reasons that Vernon struggled academically</v>

52
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.050
<v Speaker 1>was that he suffered from dyslexia,</v>

53
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:53.601
<v Speaker 1>rare condition,</v>

54
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>which was little recognized at the time.</v>

55
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It was also a stutterer.</v>

56
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It was clear,</v>

57
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.671
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

58
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>that the boy wasn't stupid.</v>

59
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>He has a natural mechanical ability and loved nothing more than pulling gadgets</v>

60
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>apart and putting them back together again.</v>

61
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>By the time it was a preteen,</v>

62
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Vernon's affinity with mechanics that morphed into a love for cars.</v>

63
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>It also lets him in a roundabout way to music finding an abandoned and broken</v>

64
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:15.591
<v Speaker 1>guitar and a bond.</v>

65
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>He fixed it up and began teaching himself to play.</v>

66
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Vernon's other great interest was in religion.</v>

67
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 1>His family were seventh day adventists,</v>

68
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Cintas,</v>

69
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>grandmother often had him accompany how to church.</v>

70
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>He was reared within the confines of that way of worship,</v>

71
00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>which means no chasing after girls taking drugs or going to teen parties.</v>

72
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>While his peers were engaged in those activities.</v>

73
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Vernon was busy reading the Bible and is watching everything religious that he</v>

74
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>could find on tv or read in books and magazines.</v>

75
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 10,</v>

76
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>he was able to recite long passages of scripture.</v>

77
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Ends was giving his own many sermons at home as a preteen then,</v>

78
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and we're still a statue.</v>

79
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.070
<v Speaker 1>You combined his passion for scripture with his efforts.</v>

80
00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Do overcome this speech impediments by listening to powerful sermons on the</v>

81
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>radio and then reciting the preachers words he would study and emulates the</v>

82
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>vocal skills of the speaker discovering this when he did so,</v>

83
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>his stutter disappeared.</v>

84
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Vernon's formal schooling finished when he drops out during his junior year at</v>

85
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Garland high school.</v>

86
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>If the 18 year old gained work as a carpenter in gallons,</v>

87
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>it was there that he began a relationship with a 15 year old girl when she fell</v>

88
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>pregnant to the girl's father,</v>

89
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>became enraged.</v>

90
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>He forced his daughter to break off the relationship and warns Vernon to stay</v>

91
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

92
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Vernon was in love with girl,</v>

93
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>but so the only option,</v>

94
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>but to heed the father's advice by now,</v>

95
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 1>his family were living in Tyler,</v>

96
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

97
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It was the ad was he approached his local seventh day adventist elders and</v>

98
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>really old style data to them.</v>

99
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>He told them that he felt a moral obligation to marry the girl.</v>

100
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.071
<v Speaker 1>He was surprised.</v>

101
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.401
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

102
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>when the eldest trying to persuade him against doing so,</v>

103
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>he had time to do reason scripturally with them only to find that they were</v>

104
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>getting angry with him.</v>

105
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.231
<v Speaker 1>In the ends,</v>

106
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>they simply ordered him to leave the church</v>

107
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.080
<v Speaker 1>as a result of Vernon situation,</v>

108
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.821
<v Speaker 1>not only here,</v>

109
00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>but his entire family were excommunicated from the seventh day adventist church,</v>

110
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly disgusted with the organization.</v>

111
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>He began looking around for an alternative church.</v>

112
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>He was told about a group called the branch Davidians who were based in Waco,</v>

113
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

114
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.920
<v Speaker 1>The branch Davidians,</v>

115
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:26.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.790
<v Speaker 1>an offshoots of an offshoot of the seventh day adventists.</v>

117
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>This original group was founded in 1929 by a Bulgarian immigrants in theU ,</v>

118
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>s named Victor,</v>

119
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>who tiff originally cools the shepherd's raags.</v>

120
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>The sex was set up in Waco,</v>

121
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

122
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.150
<v Speaker 1>The group were convinced that the apocalypse was going to a car in 1959,</v>

123
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and when it didn't,</v>

124
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>a group broke away under the leadership of a man named Benjamin Roden,</v>

125
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 1>he called this group the branch Davidians in recognition of their holding to the</v>

126
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>coming restoration of the Davidic Kingdom of Israel.</v>

127
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.650
<v Speaker 1>In 1978,</v>

128
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.130
<v Speaker 1>roden died and his wife Lois assumed leadership of the church.</v>

129
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Vernon Howell arrived at the branch Davidian compound in 1980.</v>

130
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 1>The 20 year old has long flowing hair,</v>

131
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Speaker 1>a charismatic personality,</v>

132
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>and a self effacing manner.</v>

133
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>He appeared to be extremely spiritual to those that he met at the compound</v>

134
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>holding to a strict moral code and judging himself as chief among sinners.</v>

135
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.830
<v Speaker 1>He turns up with his guitar and the desire to use this music to reach young</v>

136
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.020
<v Speaker 1>people with the message of the Lord.</v>

137
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Lois Roden was immediately taken with how old and she invited him to move into</v>

138
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the compound.</v>

139
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.931
<v Speaker 1>Before long,</v>

140
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the two became romantically involved,</v>

141
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that she was in her sixties,</v>

142
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 1>lowest began to give vernon growing prominence as a teacher at the compounds.</v>

143
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 1>She would give them time at the pulpit so he could expand his interpretations to</v>

144
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.250
<v Speaker 1>the congregation.</v>

145
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Vernon's preaching style was very different to what the church goers we're used</v>

146
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>to experiencing.</v>

147
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 1>He wore a t shirts and jeans and spoke with illustrations that will often</v>

148
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:53.760
<v Speaker 1>startling and their directness.</v>

149
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:54.511
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

150
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>he likens sin to snot on a person's finger that he just can't get off.</v>

151
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.631
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>

152
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>he acknowledged himself as imperfect as weak,</v>

153
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>and does a center then in his natural charisma,</v>

154
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>has unkempt looks,</v>

155
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>the downward style,</v>

156
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>and his deep scriptural knowledge where a potent mix.</v>

157
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>He purposefully positioned himself in the light of Jesus in opposition to the</v>

158
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>state formulaic and have a critical pharisees of mainstream religion.</v>

159
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>His status was elevated even further when he began to proclaim the gift of</v>

160
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:24.704
<v Speaker 1>prophecy.</v>

161
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>A few months after Vernon had moved in,</v>

162
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>though it's made the bombshell public announcement that she was pregnant with</v>

163
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>his child.</v>

164
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>She told her followers this was all part of God's divine arrangements.</v>

165
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

166
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>she would go onto miscarried the baby.</v>

167
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

168
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>she still elevated Vernon as spiritual as and as the next leader of the branch</v>

169
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.874
<v Speaker 1>Davidians.</v>

170
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Many in the congregation were in agreements of Lewis's consecration of Vernon as</v>

171
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:54.803
<v Speaker 1>her successor,</v>

172
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>but there was one who was definitely not and that would be lowest.</v>

173
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>His son George George viewed Vernon as a dangerous.</v>

174
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>You suffer who is shamefully manipulated his way into his mother's good graces</v>

175
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and was now poised to take over the leadership that was rightfully George's to</v>

176
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:10.754
<v Speaker 1>inherit.</v>

177
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Over the next three years,</v>

178
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>a power struggle was to play out between Vernon and George with the congregation</v>

179
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>split between the two.</v>

180
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Tensions came to a peak in 1984 when George and his arm supporters forced Vernon</v>

181
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>and about 25 of his followers to leave the compounds at Mount Carmel for the</v>

182
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>next two years.</v>

183
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>This group was situated in Palestine,</v>

184
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Texas 90 miles away where they had to live in buses and tense.</v>

185
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

186
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>vernon put his skills into building up his base of followers through his music</v>

187
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>and the power of his personality.</v>

188
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>He was able to attract new members from far and wide.</v>

189
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>In 1985,</v>

190
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>he traveled to Israel with his pregnant wife,</v>

191
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.081
<v Speaker 1>Rachel Jones.</v>

192
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the congregation members.</v>

193
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It was while in the holy lands that he became convinced that he was the modern</v>

194
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>day incarnation of King Cyrus of Persia.</v>

195
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 1>He had been tasked,</v>

196
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 1>he claimed with opening the seven seals of the book of revelation and</v>

197
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.300
<v Speaker 1>proclaiming them to all the world's back.</v>

198
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Now Common George Roden was acting increasingly erratic,</v>

199
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.820
<v Speaker 1>which was causing his followers to decline rapidly.</v>

200
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Many of the compounds openly supportive Vernon howland's longs for his return.</v>

201
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Lois roden died in 1986 and George was determined to eliminate the threats that</v>

202
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Vernon posed to his leadership.</v>

203
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>He decided to call vern,</v>

204
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 1>announced by challenging him to a resurrection competition.</v>

205
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 1>The man that could successfully raise a dead person would be the acknowledged</v>

206
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>leader of the church in order to achieve a sentence and are clearly psychotic.</v>

207
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>George has a body of zooms.</v>

208
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 1>When Vernon heard about this,</v>

209
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>he went directly to the authorities and later complaints that George had been</v>

210
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>tampering with a dead body.</v>

211
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>He was told that the authorities could do nothing unless they had photographic</v>

212
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>evidence in order to obtain the needed per that seven armed supporters into</v>

213
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Mount Carmel before they could find the exuma body.</v>

214
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>They were discovered by George's followers and a gunfight broke out in the</v>

215
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>skirmish region was wounded.</v>

216
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>The police broke up the battle and Vernon and his followers were arrested and</v>

217
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>put on trial for attempted murder.</v>

218
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I need to later be acquitted of all charges over the next couple of years.</v>

219
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Vernon's following it.</v>

220
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Palestine grew back at Mount Carmel.</v>

221
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>George became even more irrational when one of his supposed followers challenged</v>

222
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

223
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>claiming to be the messiah.</v>

224
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>George lost control and killed the man with an ax.</v>

225
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>This act saw him being sent to a hospital for the criminally insane</v>

226
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>with George now well and truly out of the way vernon and his followers oriented</v>

227
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the Mount Carmel Compounds.</v>

228
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.240
<v Speaker 1>He was now the undisputed leader of the branch Davidians not long after his rita</v>

229
00:09:43.241 --> 00:09:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and he had his name legally changed to David Koresh.</v>

230
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Koresh is the Hebrew name for Cyrus,</v>

231
00:09:48.581 --> 00:09:53.140
<v Speaker 1>who David was convinced he was the modern day incarnation of with this new name</v>

232
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.900
<v Speaker 1>came the conviction that Koresh was more than a prophet.</v>

233
00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>He was the Modern Day Messiah and the words that he spoke were of divine origin</v>

234
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.290
<v Speaker 1>as the 19 nineties,</v>

235
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Dawn's David Koresh was a 30 year old self,</v>

236
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:07.120
<v Speaker 1>proclaimed the messiah with a young wife and two children.</v>

237
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.350
<v Speaker 1>He presided over more than 100 faithful adherence who lived together in a single</v>

238
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.243
<v Speaker 1>large building,</v>

239
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.510
<v Speaker 1>having mastered the fusion of religious music and inspiration or proselytizing,</v>

240
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Koresh's marathon sermons could last all day and all night still for believers</v>

241
00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:23.230
<v Speaker 1>would hang on his every word.</v>

242
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Gresh began using his position as the revealer of God gone well to announce</v>

243
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:31.390
<v Speaker 1>supposedly divine decrees that were increasingly to his personal advantage.</v>

244
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the most controversial was that all of the women in the complex were to</v>

245
00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Speaker 1>be available to him at any time.</v>

246
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 1>For his sexual pleasure is included.</v>

247
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.060
<v Speaker 1>All of the married women as well Koresh did not confine his sexual liaisons to</v>

248
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.840
<v Speaker 1>adult women.</v>

249
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Girls as young as 12 became his sexual partners.</v>

250
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.230
<v Speaker 1>These girls had been convinced that to give themselves over to God in the form</v>

251
00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:53.470
<v Speaker 1>of Koresh was the greatest privilege that they could attain.</v>

252
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.760
<v Speaker 1>The men of Mount Carmel,</v>

253
00:10:54.761 --> 00:10:56.320
<v Speaker 1>including those who were married,</v>

254
00:10:56.321 --> 00:10:57.730
<v Speaker 1>were to remain celibate.</v>

255
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.000
<v Speaker 1>This was because there was only one seed that was holy and it flowed from,</v>

256
00:11:01.001 --> 00:11:01.061
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

257
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Koresh.</v>

258
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.410
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

259
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the children that the complex where his at the time of his</v>

260
00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:06.160
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

261
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he was father to 15 sons and daughters.</v>

262
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.920
<v Speaker 1>While the majority of the branch Davidians excepted this arrangement is the will</v>

263
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:12.490
<v Speaker 1>of God.</v>

264
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.050
<v Speaker 1>There were a handful of dissenters.</v>

265
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.650
<v Speaker 1>You left the church because of some of those who left were Australian.</v>

266
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.480
<v Speaker 1>When they returned back home to Australia,</v>

267
00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:22.810
<v Speaker 1>they went to the American embassy and child abuse charges were laid against</v>

268
00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Koresh back in the United States.</v>

269
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Other factors made some electronics in response to the allegations.</v>

270
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Child protective services sent investigators to the Mountain Carmel Complex.</v>

271
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Their specific brief,</v>

272
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:33.101
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

273
00:11:33.101 --> 00:11:37.090
<v Speaker 1>was to assess the validity of an accusation that children had access to.</v>

274
00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Firearms Koresh,</v>

275
00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

276
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.010
<v Speaker 1>showed that all of the firearms wonder lock and key and child protective</v>

277
00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:42.844
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

278
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.930
<v Speaker 1>They closed the case in the wake of the defections Koresh became increasingly</v>

279
00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:49.180
<v Speaker 1>angry and violent towards his followers.</v>

280
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 1>When one woman expressed a desire to take a child and leave,</v>

281
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 1>he denied her to teach her a lesson.</v>

282
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.043
<v Speaker 1>He rapes her.</v>

283
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Even winslow recounted the incident is a warning to the congregation at this</v>

284
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 1>time his sermons,</v>

285
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>they became darker with the constant theme of the Coming Day of judgment.</v>

286
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>He told his followers that Armageddon was going to be initiated or right there</v>

287
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 1>at Mount Carmel and so that they have to be prepared to give up their lives in</v>

288
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>order to usher in the Davidic Kingdom.</v>

289
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.050
<v Speaker 1>By 1992 Koresh had imbued a siege mentality into the minds of his followers.</v>

290
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.400
<v Speaker 1>The governmental authorities.</v>

291
00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:30.100
<v Speaker 1>They were agents of the devil ends.</v>

292
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 1>They were preparing for a cataclysmic showdown with the true followers have gone</v>

293
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.250
<v Speaker 1>to a hold up at Waco by divine inspiration.</v>

294
00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Koresh revealed that he had been instructed to stockpile weapons at the</v>

295
00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:42.314
<v Speaker 1>compounds.</v>

296
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Davidson discovers that the trading of guns was a lucrative business,</v>

297
00:12:46.011 --> 00:12:50.150
<v Speaker 1>providing much needed funds for the ongoing costs associated with the compounds.</v>

298
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 1>He would have members buying up cheap weapons and then selling them at gun trade</v>

299
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:54.710
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

300
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Any excess money would be used to build up that rational.</v>

301
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.921
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

302
00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:01.580
<v Speaker 1>the information about the presence of weapons in Mount Carmel had been passed on</v>

303
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:05.300
<v Speaker 1>by the agents who had visited from child protective services to the FBI who</v>

304
00:13:05.301 --> 00:13:07.520
<v Speaker 1>would in turn given it to the bureau of Alcohol,</v>

305
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:08.180
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>

306
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 1>and firearms.</v>

307
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.510
<v Speaker 1>The ATF now began surveillance of the property.</v>

308
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 1>The situation winds up a notch when the ups delivery package was seen by agents</v>

309
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.240
<v Speaker 1>to contain hands grenades,</v>

310
00:13:17.241 --> 00:13:18.200
<v Speaker 1>which were illegal.</v>

311
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.100
<v Speaker 1>This discovery led to an eight month investigation which revealed a trend of</v>

312
00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:26.300
<v Speaker 1>everything from grenade launchers to assault weapons ending up at Mount Carmel</v>

313
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.100
<v Speaker 1>by early November of 1992.</v>

314
00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:31.640
<v Speaker 1>The ATF had amassed enough evidence to take Koresh into custody.</v>

315
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.410
<v Speaker 1>They will worried though that his followers,</v>

316
00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:36.080
<v Speaker 1>he sincerely believed that he was the Messiah,</v>

317
00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.300
<v Speaker 1>would fight to stop them from taking him away.</v>

318
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They could have arrested him when he was in town buying supplies,</v>

319
00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:43.190
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason they chose not to.</v>

320
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.761
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

321
00:13:43.761 --> 00:13:47.480
<v Speaker 1>they placed some undercover agents in a small cabin that was situated right in</v>

322
00:13:47.481 --> 00:13:49.400
<v Speaker 1>front of the entrance to the compounds.</v>

323
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.301
<v Speaker 1>One of the agents,</v>

324
00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Robert Rodriguez manage to friends members of the group and get himself invited</v>

325
00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:58.010
<v Speaker 1>to a Bible study class where you could observe Koresh shop close.</v>

326
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.210
<v Speaker 1>The ATF concluded that Koresh was an imminent danger to society who could</v>

327
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.800
<v Speaker 1>unleash his followers and they're lethal force upon any target at any time.</v>

328
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.090
<v Speaker 1>They decided that the best course of action was to stage a raid on his complex.</v>

329
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.520
<v Speaker 1>The date was set for February the 28th,</v>

330
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.031
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

331
00:14:14.031 --> 00:14:14.864
<v Speaker 1>92,</v>

332
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.210
<v Speaker 1>an hour before the raid was scheduled to go down under cover.</v>

333
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Agent Rodriguez went into the compounds and showed Koresh that morning's copy of</v>

334
00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:23.360
<v Speaker 1>a local paper with it's blazing headline,</v>

335
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.410
<v Speaker 1>the Sinful Messiah alongside a picture of Koresh Koresh.</v>

336
00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:30.620
<v Speaker 1>You had already been informed that there was a buildup of law enforcements and</v>

337
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.120
<v Speaker 1>media around the area told her dri guys that he knew that the ATF were about to</v>

338
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:36.860
<v Speaker 1>attack upon exiting mounds,</v>

339
00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Carmel Rodriguez,</v>

340
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.170
<v Speaker 1>trying to warn his atf bosses that Koresh already knew about the surprise rate,</v>

341
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was too late.</v>

342
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Fully armed agents were already closing in on the compounds.</v>

343
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.150
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

344
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.360
<v Speaker 1>it remains unclear as to which side fired first,</v>

345
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 1>but within a fist firefight was underway.</v>

346
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Moving 70 ATF officers were secret ID around the building.</v>

347
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 1>While army helicopters cycled above inside branch Davidian members put fire on</v>

348
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the invaders who had come to take away that Messiah.</v>

349
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>The shooting lasted for more than 60 minutes.</v>

350
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Koresh was hitting the wrist while six of his followers were shot dead for ATF.</v>

351
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Agents were also killed.</v>

352
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>As the fighting continued Koresh made a phone call to the local police</v>

353
00:15:15.891 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 1>departments urging that the rate be stopped,</v>

354
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.921
<v Speaker 1>the request,</v>

355
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 1>it fell on deaf ears and he hung up and proceeded to go upstairs.</v>

356
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>It was then that he was wounded a second time.</v>

357
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 1>This time more seriously,</v>

358
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 1>the bullet penetrated his hip,</v>

359
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>confining them to the floor.</v>

360
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.080
<v Speaker 1>When the shooting ended,</v>

361
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 1>the ATF had multiple casualties and no David Koresh.</v>

362
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 1>The handling of the raid was roundly condemned leading to intervention by the</v>

363
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>FBI with worldwide attention now focused on Waco.</v>

364
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 1>The new men in charge were determined to ends the standoff as quickly as</v>

365
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:45.284
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

366
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Final battle that Koresh had been proclaiming for so many years was now upon his</v>

367
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:58.630
<v Speaker 1>followers with him were 117 of the faithful,</v>

368
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:02.980
<v Speaker 1>including 46 children and nobody wanted to leave but Koresh sent out 14</v>

369
00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

370
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 1>none of which were his offspring in the days after the raise Koresh.</v>

371
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:08.890
<v Speaker 1>His main preoccupation during the siege,</v>

372
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:10.630
<v Speaker 1>which was to last for 51 days,</v>

373
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>was to get his message about the seven seals,</v>

374
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:17.080
<v Speaker 1>sounds the wells the rave had created a media frenzy and he believed that he</v>

375
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 1>could capitalize on the publicity to get the word out for hours on end.</v>

376
00:16:21.191 --> 00:16:24.400
<v Speaker 1>He proselytized over the phone to FBI negotiators.</v>

377
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Three days after the raid Koresh agreed to bring out all of his followers.</v>

378
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.460
<v Speaker 1>If you get one of his sermons ad on the radio,</v>

379
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 1>this was Julie.</v>

380
00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:32.231
<v Speaker 1>You complied with,</v>

381
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but Koresh failed to live up to his side of the bargain,</v>

382
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.830
<v Speaker 1>claiming that God had told him to hold off until you received further</v>

383
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.664
<v Speaker 1>instruction.</v>

384
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.481
<v Speaker 1>After two weeks,</v>

385
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:40.841
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>

386
00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:44.290
<v Speaker 1>water and milk for the young children was running dangerously low.</v>

387
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Inside the compounds Koresh told his followers that the hardship they were</v>

388
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:51.850
<v Speaker 1>facing was a direct test of their faith in him.</v>

389
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Things got worse when the FBI caught off all power to the complex and began</v>

390
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>playing loud music and shining blazing lights throughout the night in order to</v>

391
00:16:59.231 --> 00:17:02.980
<v Speaker 1>prevent the branch Davidians from sleeping still the people inside it would not</v>

392
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:03.550
<v Speaker 1>budge,</v>

393
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.001
<v Speaker 1>crash,</v>

394
00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:04.840
<v Speaker 1>and then last thing,</v>

395
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll say trickle of people thus far,</v>

396
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.690
<v Speaker 1>but now he angrily declared that no one else would leave Mount Carmel so long as</v>

397
00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:13.840
<v Speaker 1>the government kept up the torments and increasingly frustrated.</v>

398
00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:18.520
<v Speaker 1>FBI now brought in Abrams tanks which proceeded to smash and destroy all</v>

399
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.320
<v Speaker 1>property outside of the compounds,</v>

400
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:24.460
<v Speaker 1>including vehicles with the pressure tactics falling flat to the FBI allowed a</v>

401
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:28.000
<v Speaker 1>defense attorney hazed by Koresh's mother to go in and talk to his clients.</v>

402
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Gresh told the lawyer that he knew that the government would not let him live</v>

403
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.650
<v Speaker 1>even though the FBI had offered to arrange for a worldwide television broadcast</v>

404
00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:39.880
<v Speaker 1>of his message if he promised to come out is trusting them was shattered and he</v>

405
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:40.960
<v Speaker 1>refused the offer.</v>

406
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.710
<v Speaker 1>There was a breakthrough of sorts on April the 14th when Koresh announced that</v>

407
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.880
<v Speaker 1>golden instructed him to write down the entire message of the seven seals of</v>

408
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.420
<v Speaker 1>when this majestic work was completed.</v>

409
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 1>As promised,</v>

410
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.040
<v Speaker 1>the siege would be over and the branch Davidians would come out.</v>

411
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>The seven seals offer,</v>

412
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:56.710
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

413
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>was never passed onto us.</v>

414
00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Attorney General Janet Reno,</v>

415
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 1>who want April [inaudible] 17 for authorized the plan to use tanks and tear gas</v>

416
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.720
<v Speaker 1>to bring this to an end.</v>

417
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.470
<v Speaker 1>The end's began at 6:00 AM on April the 19th when an FBI agents phoned Koresh</v>

418
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.470
<v Speaker 1>and told him that tear gas was being placed in the building by mechanical arms</v>

419
00:18:20.471 --> 00:18:21.460
<v Speaker 1>attached to tanks.</v>

420
00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.570
<v Speaker 1>He stressed that it was not an assault and urge the Davidians not to fire their</v>

421
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:26.240
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

422
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Batang smashed into the building as it delivered.</v>

423
00:18:28.511 --> 00:18:28.961
<v Speaker 1>CS,</v>

424
00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:31.390
<v Speaker 1>gas and size of the people were in agony,</v>

425
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.900
<v Speaker 1>unable to breathe and feeling as if their strikes and the lungs were on fire.</v>

426
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Still maybe came out after six hours of fire erupted,</v>

427
00:18:39.011 --> 00:18:40.900
<v Speaker 1>which quickly got out of control.</v>

428
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Now surely I'll look his reasons.</v>

429
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Those inside would come out,</v>

430
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.160
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't to be the fire raged through the building,</v>

431
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.120
<v Speaker 1>killing 17,</v>

432
00:18:49.121 --> 00:18:49.781
<v Speaker 1>nine people,</v>

433
00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:51.100
<v Speaker 1>including 22 children,</v>

434
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Koresh had made his way to the chapel with the flames closing in.</v>

435
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.870
<v Speaker 1>He died of a gunshot wound to the hat.</v>

436
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows whether or not he claimed his own life.</v>
