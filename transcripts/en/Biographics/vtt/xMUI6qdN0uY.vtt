00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>In 1996,</v>

2
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.900
<v Speaker 1>the FBI apprehensive man,</v>

3
00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>this alluded camp chef for nearly two decades,</v>

4
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>is homemade letter bombs struck fear across the United States,</v>

5
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>mostly targeting our lines and universities earning him the nickname the unit</v>

6
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Baalbek all told he killed three people and injured 23 more,</v>

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>who took great care not to leave a trace of evidence,</v>

8
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>and unlike other serial murderers,</v>

9
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>he didn't seek glory and fame phase cuttings if it wasn't for his manifesto.</v>

10
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>The publication that outlined his disdain of technology and modern society,</v>

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>he may never have been caught after his arrest.</v>

12
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>The world was shocked that this backwoods,</v>

13
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.211
<v Speaker 1>living hermits,</v>

14
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>living without electricity or running water,</v>

15
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>could be the man responsible for such sophisticated killings.</v>

16
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Today we explore this man,</v>

17
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the domestic terrorists and lone wolf killer Ted Kaczynski.</v>

18
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.110
<v Speaker 1>On May the 22nd 1942,</v>

19
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Theodore John [inaudible] was born in Chicago to blue collar,</v>

20
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>second generation Polish Americans Theodore Tuck and one deck is inscape.</v>

21
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.081
<v Speaker 1>Seven years later,</v>

22
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 1>the Kazinski had a second son who was called.</v>

23
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>David's little is written about Ted's early years,</v>

24
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.630
<v Speaker 1>except for one incidents that may have been the impetus to the boy's tendency to</v>

25
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>alienate himself according to his mother and brother.</v>

26
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>When ted was a nine month old baby,</v>

27
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 1>he developed a severe case of hives that required him to be quarantined for 10</v>

28
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>days in the hospital afterwards.</v>

29
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Wonder reported it took a long time for her son to return to his normal,</v>

30
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>happy self,</v>

31
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>worried about his shyness and social development.</v>

32
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Once a claim,</v>

33
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>she considered putting her young son into studies for autistic children,</v>

34
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately decided against it.</v>

35
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 1>One neighbor remembered him as strictly a loner.</v>

36
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>When Ted was 10 years old,</v>

37
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:50.011
<v Speaker 1>the penske family moved out of Chicago to the southwest suburb of Evergreen</v>

38
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Park.</v>

39
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.651
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

40
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>this was a neighborhood predominantly made up of Irish people,</v>

41
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:53.921
<v Speaker 1>Italians,</v>

42
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.311
<v Speaker 1>Czechs,</v>

43
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and pols to Ed's parents would later say that the move out of Chicago was so</v>

44
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>that the boys could enjoy a better class of friends at Evergreen Park to thrived</v>

45
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and seems like a normal kid to most people,</v>

46
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>except for one exception is remarkable intellect.</v>

47
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>In the fifth grade,</v>

48
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>ted was labeled a genius after he scored 167 on an Iq test is high marks,</v>

49
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 1>puts him in the same Iq ranges,</v>

50
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physicist,</v>

51
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein dead,</v>

52
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>skipped sixth grades,</v>

53
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>and then at the urging of school administrators his junior year of high school</v>

54
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

55
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Ted would later claim that his parents pushed him too hard and it's being</v>

56
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 1>younger and smaller than his classmates,</v>

57
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>made it difficult for him to fit in with his peers still.</v>

58
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 1>He had made some friends and he was the ringleader of an outclassed clique known</v>

59
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>as the briefcase boys that have a green park community.</v>

60
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.470
<v Speaker 1>High School Dad was especially adept in mathematics and science and spend hours</v>

61
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>working out advanced problems.</v>

62
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.751
<v Speaker 1>In high school.</v>

63
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 1>He joined the chest biology,</v>

64
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:48.901
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>

65
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>and mathematics clubs.</v>

66
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>He played trombone in the marching band,</v>

67
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>explored the music of Bach and Vivaldi and Roche compositions for himself.</v>

68
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.651
<v Speaker 1>His younger brother,</v>

69
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>David and their father to perform at home.</v>

70
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>His physics teacher,</v>

71
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Robert [inaudible],</v>

72
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>described him as honest,</v>

73
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>ethical and sociable Ted attended summer school and was able to graduate at the</v>

74
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>age of just 15 that year and he was wanting to five national merit finalists at</v>

75
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>his high school.</v>

76
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>One former classmates said Ted was never really seen as a person,</v>

77
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>as an individual personality.</v>

78
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>He was always regarded as a walking brain,</v>

79
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.973
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

80
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Ted seemed aware of how others viewed him.</v>

81
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.743
<v Speaker 1>He'd I just says,</v>

82
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>by the time I left high school,</v>

83
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely regarded as a freak by a large segment of the student body and</v>

84
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>he felt a gradual increasing amounts of hostility from the other children.</v>

85
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>In 1958,</v>

86
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Ted was accepted into Harvard and just part of the recommendation letter,</v>

87
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.060
<v Speaker 1>his high school counselor then lower skill and wrote,</v>

88
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.611
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

89
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Tad's as one of the greatest contributions to make to society.</v>

90
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>He is reflective,</v>

91
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>sensitive,</v>

92
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>and deeply conscious of his responsibilities to society.</v>

93
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>His only drawback is a tendency to be rather quiet in his original meetings with</v>

94
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:55.460
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

95
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but most adults on our staff and as many people in the community who are mature</v>

96
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>find him easy to talk to you and very challenging intellectually.</v>

97
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>He has a number of friends among high school students and it seems to influence</v>

98
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>them to think more seriously during this period of his life,</v>

99
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Ted held immense promise for his future,</v>

100
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but he may not have been ready to leave home.</v>

101
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>One friend remembers urgent because Zinski's father not to let the boy go</v>

102
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>arguing he's too young,</v>

103
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.983
<v Speaker 1>too immature,</v>

104
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>and Harvard too impersonal</v>

105
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.440
<v Speaker 1>as an incoming Harvard freshmen because inscape was 16 years old that will</v>

106
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:33.710
<v Speaker 1>service Dr who interviewed him as part of the routine screening process.</v>

107
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Notice good impression,</v>

108
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:36.260
<v Speaker 1>created attractive,</v>

109
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>mature for her age,</v>

110
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.570
<v Speaker 1>relaxed talks easily,</v>

111
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 1>fluently,</v>

112
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.080
<v Speaker 1>and pleasantly likes people then gets on well with them.</v>

113
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Being among the youngest and brightest freshmen,</v>

114
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Ted's was housed at eight Prescott Street,</v>

115
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.870
<v Speaker 1>a three story Victorian House just outside of Harvard Yard.</v>

116
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.681
<v Speaker 1>That year,</v>

117
00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 1>the dean of freshmen,</v>

118
00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Skiddy von stabbed junior,</v>

119
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 1>decided to use the residents specifically for less mature boys who needed a more</v>

120
00:04:58.191 --> 00:04:59.870
<v Speaker 1>intimate nurturing environments.</v>

121
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It was a place where those boys would not get lost in the larger impersonal</v>

122
00:05:03.561 --> 00:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>dorms,</v>

123
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.640
<v Speaker 1>so I've come to the conclusion that while the Dean's plan was well intentions,</v>

124
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.270
<v Speaker 1>putting all the fragile young men together had the opposite effect.</v>

125
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>It isolated them making,</v>

126
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:14.660
<v Speaker 1>adjusting to Harvard even more difficult.</v>

127
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.560
<v Speaker 1>One student living at a Prescott later said it was not unusual to spend all</v>

128
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 1>one's time in one's room and then rush out the door to library or class off to</v>

129
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>his arrest because Zinski's housemates,</v>

130
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Gerald Burns,</v>

131
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 1>wrote this.</v>

132
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>He was as normal as I am now.</v>

133
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Speaker 1>It was just hard on him because he was much younger than his classmates.</v>

134
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Despite the adversity,</v>

135
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Speaker 1>he took up swimming,</v>

136
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.851
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

137
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>played trombone,</v>

138
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 1>and pick up basketball.</v>

139
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.750
<v Speaker 1>He also had a few friends.</v>

140
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski is sophomore year,</v>

141
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.570
<v Speaker 1>marked the beginning of,</v>

142
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 1>in his words,</v>

143
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.060
<v Speaker 1>the worst experience of my life together with 21 undergraduate students.</v>

144
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Kosinski was a participant in an unethical study conducted by Henry,</v>

145
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.801
<v Speaker 1>a Murray.</v>

146
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 1>The Harvard professor and psychologist best known for pioneering personality</v>

147
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>tests before Harvard,</v>

148
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Maria had been a colonel in theU ,</v>

149
00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.181
<v Speaker 1>s army,</v>

150
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and an agent for the Office of Strategic Services Oss,</v>

151
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>which later became known as the CIA.</v>

152
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>According to his colleagues at oss,</v>

153
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Larry was obsessed with mind control and used lsd among other drugs to determine</v>

154
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>how to brainwash subjects.</v>

155
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>There is no evidence to suggest Marie used Lsd in his experiments with</v>

156
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski.</v>

157
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Though the study was efficiently named multiform.</v>

158
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Assessments of personality development among gifted college men and its purpose</v>

159
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>was to measure how the students reacted on distress.</v>

160
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Subjects were told that they would be debating personal philosophies with other</v>

161
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>students and writing essays,</v>

162
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>detailing their beliefs and their aspirations.</v>

163
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>The essays were then sends over to anonymous attorneys who conducted vehement,</v>

164
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>sweeping,</v>

165
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and personally abusive interrogations.</v>

166
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>The participants want electrodes to monitor their physiological responses and</v>

167
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>these sessions will also films later subjects.</v>

168
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Expressions of rage during the interrogations were repeatedly played back to</v>

169
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

170
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Some sources have suggested that Mary study was part of the federal government's</v>

171
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>research on mind control known as projects and gay ultra author Alton Chase.</v>

172
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:02.421
<v Speaker 1>Questions,</v>

173
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>whether they purposely brutalizing psychological experiments contributed to the</v>

174
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>making of Kaczynski the unibomber.</v>

175
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

176
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>by no means can Kaczynski is bombing campaign be laid at Harvard store,</v>

177
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.290
<v Speaker 1>though his staunch anti technological views are recognized in part to Harvard's</v>

178
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 1>curriculum in the late 19 fifties,</v>

179
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski and a bachelor of arts from Harvard in 1962,</v>

180
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>you finishing with a three point one,</v>

181
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 1>two GPA in his own words,</v>

182
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>ted later records his experience overall this Harvard as a tremendous thing for</v>

183
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

184
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>He thrived on the hard work and self discipline and it became enthusiastic about</v>

185
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:36.014
<v Speaker 1>willpower.</v>

186
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1962 at the age of 20 and</v>

187
00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:47.070
<v Speaker 1>spent the next five years of his life in Ann Arbor.</v>

188
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.610
<v Speaker 1>He earned his master's degree in 1964 and his doctoral degree in 1967,</v>

189
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>

190
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It was not his first choice school.</v>

191
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:58.120
<v Speaker 1>He would have preferred the University of California at Berkeley or the</v>

192
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>University of Chicago.</v>

193
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He was accepted to all three,</v>

194
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.330
<v Speaker 1>but Michigan offered Kaczynski a teaching position and a financial aid package</v>

195
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>that Michigan had received $2,310 annually.</v>

196
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Roughly the equivalent of about $19,000 today during this time that you</v>

197
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 1>specialized in geometric function theory and it's completed his dissertation</v>

198
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.590
<v Speaker 1>boundary functions to great claim.</v>

199
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 1>His doctoral advisor,</v>

200
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:19.451
<v Speaker 1>Alan Shields,</v>

201
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 1>called it the best I've ever directed.</v>

202
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Winning the Sumner Byron mires prize for Michigan's Best Mathematics</v>

203
00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>dissertation of the year.</v>

204
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski published five journal articles based on this too.</v>

205
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>While Michigan in three offset,</v>

206
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.520
<v Speaker 1>despite Kaczynski is academic success,</v>

207
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.170
<v Speaker 1>he ends 12 days and five days over 18 courses and his students rating him as an</v>

208
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 1>above average instructs you did not enjoy Michigan.</v>

209
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.280
<v Speaker 1>He felt the standards were richards and the professors were mostly sloppy,</v>

210
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 1>careless and poorly organized,</v>

211
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:47.890
<v Speaker 1>as he said,</v>

212
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.130
<v Speaker 1>most instructors and most students did only what they have to do.</v>

213
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>There was no interest or enthusiasm or even any sense of responsibility about</v>

214
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>doing a good job.</v>

215
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>The mathematics department was enthusiastic about him,</v>

216
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but many others didn't seem to notice him.</v>

217
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Underneath the quiet and studious demeanor,</v>

218
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.590
<v Speaker 1>no one suspected his rage was building his ideology forming and it was at this</v>

219
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:13.640
<v Speaker 1>point that he apparently made the decision to start killing because sinskey</v>

220
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.543
<v Speaker 1>later says,</v>

221
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I thought I will kill,</v>

222
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>but I will make at least some effort to avoid detection so that I can kill</v>

223
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.333
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

224
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>According to Sally Johnson,</v>

225
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 1>who conducted a psychological profile on Kaczynski during his court proceedings,</v>

226
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it was during his fourth year at Michigan that he began to fantasize about</v>

227
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>breaking away from society.</v>

228
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>She wrote,</v>

229
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 1>he decided that he would do whatever he always wanted to do to go to Canada to</v>

230
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>take off in the woods with a rifle and try to live off the country.</v>

231
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.561
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't work,</v>

232
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>and if I can get back to civilization before I starve,</v>

233
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>then I will come back here and to kill someone I hate.</v>

234
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.861
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski.</v>

235
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Also shared with Johnson that he suffered from nightmares and sexual repression.</v>

236
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:51.534
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

237
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 1>he began fantasizing about being female and reasons the only way he would ever</v>

238
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>be able to touch a woman was simply to become one.</v>

239
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski went so far as even to go to the university's health center to discuss</v>

240
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>a possible sex change,</v>

241
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 1>but he had a sudden change of heart in the waiting room.</v>

242
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>He shared with Johnson his feelings of humiliation ends of disgust,</v>

243
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly felt better when he thought about murdering the psychiatrist.</v>

244
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Just then there came a major turning point in his life.</v>

245
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>He later told Johnson like a phoenix.</v>

246
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I burst from the ashes of my despair to a glorious new hope.</v>

247
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 1>In late 1967,</v>

248
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski became the youngest assistant professor of mathematics in the history</v>

249
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>of UC Berkeley.</v>

250
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He was 25 years old.</v>

251
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>He stayed on for less than two years,</v>

252
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:37.770
<v Speaker 1>teaching undergraduate classes in geometry and calculus before a sudden and</v>

253
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 1>unexpected resignation.</v>

254
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.020
<v Speaker 1>No one knew at the time that Kosinski never intended to launch his career at</v>

255
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley.</v>

256
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 1>He only wanted to earn enough money to fulfill this plan of checking out of the</v>

257
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>modern world is moving into the wilderness.</v>

258
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>By the mid to late 19 sixties,</v>

259
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Kazinski had concluded that mathematics was too close to the evils of technology</v>

260
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 1>which he despised.</v>

261
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>In 1971 Kaczynski wrote an essay and it began.</v>

262
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.300
<v Speaker 1>It is argued that continued scientific and technical progress will inevitably</v>

263
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 1>result in the extinction of individual liberty.</v>

264
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It was imperative that this juggernaut to be stopped,</v>

265
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski went on.</v>

266
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.870
<v Speaker 1>This could not be done by simply popular,</v>

267
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 1>rising a certain libertarian philosophy unless that philosophy is accompanied by</v>

268
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 1>a program of concrete action.</v>

269
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Mm</v>

270
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.120
<v Speaker 1>often leaving Berkeley.</v>

271
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski lived with his parents for two years before building his remote cabin</v>

272
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.740
<v Speaker 1>outside of Lincoln,</v>

273
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Montana on lands that he purchased with his brothers help.</v>

274
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 1>The cabin was a simple structure with no electricity or running water.</v>

275
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.550
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>

276
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:40.150
<v Speaker 1>he survived to working odd jobs using an old bicycle to get to and from the</v>

277
00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:40.750
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

278
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.080
<v Speaker 1>He tells himself survival skills such as tracking game and edible plants</v>

279
00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:46.240
<v Speaker 1>identification as well as organic farming.</v>

280
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 1>He visited the library and read classic works in that original languages.</v>

281
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.400
<v Speaker 1>In 1975,</v>

282
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 1>he started to see the impacts real estate developments on the Montana wilderness</v>

283
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>and it enraged him.</v>

284
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>He had considered living peacefully,</v>

285
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but now all he wanted was to get back at the system by acts of revenge and carry</v>

286
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:06.610
<v Speaker 1>out his earlier fantasies of killing</v>

287
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>from 1978 and 1995.</v>

288
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski mailed or hand delivered a series of homemade bombs of increasing</v>

289
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:18.664
<v Speaker 1>sophistication.</v>

290
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.890
<v Speaker 1>He took great care not to leave any fingerprints behind it.</v>

291
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Purposefully left misleading clues to confuse the authorities as first bomb was</v>

292
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.551
<v Speaker 1>meant for Buckley.</v>

293
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Chris stay professor of materials engineering at northwestern university.</v>

294
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Chris was suspicious of the package and cooled campus police officer Terry.</v>

295
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Maker opened debts and it's the package exploders injuring makers lefthand,</v>

296
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 1>a second bomb in May of 1979.</v>

297
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Were sent again to northwestern this time.</v>

298
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Mitch was a graduate student,</v>

299
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:46.294
<v Speaker 1>John Harris,</v>

300
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.820
<v Speaker 1>who suffered minor cuts and burns when it exploded because in this case,</v>

301
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>next one was intended to blow up a Boeing seven to seven American Airlines</v>

302
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>flight for four for traveling from Chicago to Washington DC.</v>

303
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 1>The bomb was placed in the cargo hold and thankfully a faulty timing mechanism</v>

304
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>prevented it from igniting.</v>

305
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It did really smoke,</v>

306
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>forcing an emergency landing,</v>

307
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and author already stated that it would have had enough power to obliterate the</v>

308
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>

309
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.420
<v Speaker 1>hadn't exploded.</v>

310
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.470
<v Speaker 1>There was at this point that the FBI opens the unabomber case and led a task</v>

311
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>force made up of the Bureau of Alcohol,</v>

312
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:16.511
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco,</v>

313
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:17.051
<v Speaker 1>firearms,</v>

314
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>and explosives,</v>

315
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>and to us postal inspection.</v>

316
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Service analysis on the bomb materials proved fruitless because Zinski's</v>

317
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 1>handmade explosives were made with scrap materials found almost anywhere for</v>

318
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:29.350
<v Speaker 1>more bombs caused unsuspecting victims,</v>

319
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Burns and cuts from 1980 to 1985.</v>

320
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 1>The first serious injury that occurred on May the 15th,</v>

321
00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>1985 at Berkeley when graduate students and to captain in the U.</v>

322
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.521
<v Speaker 1>S air force.</v>

323
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:41.440
<v Speaker 1>John Houser opens the package.</v>

324
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.260
<v Speaker 1>He lost four fingers and vision in one of his eyes.</v>

325
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 1>This bomb was followed by two more bombs in 1985 and then on December the 11th</v>

326
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>of that year,</v>

327
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>the blast from a Netherland splinter loaded bomb killed Sacramento computer</v>

328
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:53.600
<v Speaker 1>store and a huge.</v>

329
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And if this was the first of three unibomber casualties,</v>

330
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.790
<v Speaker 1>because Zinsky targeted another computer store owner Gary wrote in 1997 who</v>

331
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 1>suffered nerve damage when the bomb went off after nearly a decade,</v>

332
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.860
<v Speaker 1>the FBI who was nowhere close to capturing the unibody,</v>

333
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 1>but then all of a sudden he stopped sending bombs for a period of six years from</v>

334
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 1>1987 to 1993.</v>

335
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>The authorities simply thought he was gone.</v>

336
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 1>They surmised he died my accidental death or natural causes,</v>

337
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>or maybe had a change of heart because in reign of terror it wasn't over.</v>

338
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Though he mailed for more bombs from 1993 and 1995,</v>

339
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 1>murdering two more people,</v>

340
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.720
<v Speaker 1>including Thomas Jane,</v>

341
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Masa and advertising executive.</v>

342
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>And Gilbert's Brendan Murray,</v>

343
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>a timber industry lobbyist is one of the bombs severely wounded and disfigured.</v>

344
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:36.240
<v Speaker 1>David [inaudible],</v>

345
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.790
<v Speaker 1>a computer science professor at Yale University and Charles Epstein and a</v>

346
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>geneticist at the University of California San Francisco.</v>

347
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski is bombs were often stamps with the letters fc and the FBI noted the</v>

348
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.310
<v Speaker 1>theme of nature and trees since the often included bits of bark and brunches.</v>

349
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>His explosive packages</v>

350
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>in 1995 because insignia contacted the media blackmailing the New York Times and</v>

351
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:07.151
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post into publishing his 35,000 word essay industrial society and his</v>

352
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

353
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.240
<v Speaker 1>the media dubbed this the unabomber manifesto and in exchange for its release</v>

354
00:15:12.241 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>word for word,</v>

355
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 1>he would desist from terrorism and his manifesto,</v>

356
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski asserts that the downfall of the human race can be attributed to the</v>

357
00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution and modern technological society.</v>

358
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Your claims,</v>

359
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.810
<v Speaker 1>widespread psychological suffering has taken place because of technologies</v>

360
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 1>destabilizing effects and he argues people spend too much time engaged in</v>

361
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 1>useless pursuits such as the consumption of entertainment,</v>

362
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.321
<v Speaker 1>our society.</v>

363
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 1>It tends to regards as a sickness any mode of thought or behavior that is</v>

364
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient for the system.</v>

365
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And this is plausible because when an individual can't fit into the system,</v>

366
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 1>it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system.</v>

367
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the manipulation of an individual to adjust to the system is seen as a</v>

368
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:57.890
<v Speaker 1>cure for a sickness and therefore as good Kosinski saw,</v>

369
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the only way of returning to wild nature and freedom was to destroy progress,</v>

370
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:05.120
<v Speaker 1>which he believed was entirely possible.</v>

371
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 1>The manifestos reception was regarded as a work of genius by some and didn't</v>

372
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 1>totally sane by others.</v>

373
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 1>It has been compared to Aldous Huxley's brave new worlds and George Orwell's</v>

374
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 1>1984.</v>

375
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.110
<v Speaker 1>James q Wilson wrote that it was a Catholic reasoned,</v>

376
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.310
<v Speaker 1>artfully written paper,</v>

377
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>if it is the work of a madman than the writings of many political philosophers,</v>

378
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Zachary.</v>

379
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.870
<v Speaker 1>So Tom Paine called marks.</v>

380
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll scarcely more sane</v>

381
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.830
<v Speaker 1>following the publication of the manifesto.</v>

382
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.520
<v Speaker 1>David Kaczynski and his wife Linda noticed chilling familiarities between his</v>

383
00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:42.330
<v Speaker 1>brother's letters and an earlier essay that Ted wrote for three weeks.</v>

384
00:16:42.331 --> 00:16:45.990
<v Speaker 1>They pulled over years of correspondence looking for towel towel clues before</v>

385
00:16:45.991 --> 00:16:47.340
<v Speaker 1>contacting the authorities.</v>

386
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Once convinced the unabomber,</v>

387
00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:49.890
<v Speaker 1>it could be David's brother,</v>

388
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.000
<v Speaker 1>they hired an attorney,</v>

389
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.440
<v Speaker 1>contacted a criminal profiler to analyze the letters and contact the FBI.</v>

390
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

391
00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.510
<v Speaker 1>agents were actively following up on every 2000 tips and a recluse living in the</v>

392
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:03.660
<v Speaker 1>backwoods of Montana didn't seem to match their expectations,</v>

393
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.800
<v Speaker 1>not expert linguists analyze the letters and the essay and determined that they</v>

394
00:17:07.801 --> 00:17:09.450
<v Speaker 1>were certainly the same man.</v>

395
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.090
<v Speaker 1>FBI agents arrested because then scale in April the third,</v>

396
00:17:12.091 --> 00:17:12.451
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

397
00:17:12.451 --> 00:17:13.021
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

398
00:17:13.021 --> 00:17:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It is Kevin where he was found in an unkempt state,</v>

399
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.390
<v Speaker 1>etc. This cabin reveal to cache of bombing components.</v>

400
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.410
<v Speaker 1>40,000 handwritten journal pages that included bomb making experiments,</v>

401
00:17:22.411 --> 00:17:24.240
<v Speaker 1>descriptions of the unibomber crimes,</v>

402
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.340
<v Speaker 1>and one live bomb ready for the mailing.</v>

403
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.420
<v Speaker 1>They also found what appeared to be the original type two manuscripts of</v>

404
00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:32.160
<v Speaker 1>industrial society and its future.</v>

405
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.120
<v Speaker 1>By this point,</v>

406
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.040
<v Speaker 1>the unibomber had been targeted and for the most expensive investigation in fbi</v>

407
00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:38.760
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

408
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.020
<v Speaker 1>a federal grand jury indicted kaczynski in april of 1996 on 10 counts of</v>

409
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.130
<v Speaker 1>illegally transporting,</v>

410
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.540
<v Speaker 1>mailing and using bombs and three counts of murder because zinski's defense had</v>

411
00:17:48.541 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 1>attempted to the insanity defense in order to avoid the death penalty that</v>

412
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 1>kosinski refused.</v>

413
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He tried to fire as attorneys and attempted suicide by hanging on january the</v>

414
00:17:57.031 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>ninth.</v>

415
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.590
<v Speaker 1>On the judge's order,</v>

416
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>kaczynski underwent a psychological evaluation by sally johnson,</v>

417
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 1>who gave him a provisional diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.</v>

418
