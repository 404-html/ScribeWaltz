00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.140
Let's get into it.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.360
<v 0>From humble beginnings in rural Kansas,</v>

8
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.980
Dwight David Eisenhower rose to become the most powerful man on the planet.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.420
Before reaching that pinnacle,

10
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:34.470
he took charge of the airline defenses against the Nazi beast that was roaring

11
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.510
across Europe.
He led the world's victory,

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.080
becoming the undisputed man of the hour before leading America through the

13
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.590
fabulous fifties in today's biographics,

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.520
we learned about the 34th presidents of the United States,
Dwight Eisenhower.

15
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.270
Dwight David Eisenhower was born on the 14th of October,
1890 in Denison,

16
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:00.370
Texas.
His parents had lived in Abilene,

17
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:04.120
Kansas before his birth and it was there that they returned when he was just an

18
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.720
infant.
How's it trials?
He was involved in an accident,

19
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.710
so that cost his younger brother and I,

20
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.980
these are referred to this as an experience that taught him the need to be

21
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.910
protective of those who wants to him.
His.
Charles did that.
It was active,
eager,

22
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.790
and happy.
Sports played an important part in his developments.

23
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.590
Any excelled in baseball both in school and on a vacant lot next to his home.

24
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.640
Eisenhower said that not making the baseball team at west point was one of the

25
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:32.170
greatest disappointments of my life.
Maybe my greatest.
Yeah,
football.

26
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.600
It was his first love.
He made the varsity football team.

27
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:38.590
There's was a starter is running back and linebacker in 1912 when he tackled the

28
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:42.490
legendary Jim Thorpe of the Carlisle Indians.
Those sport was important.

29
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:46.510
The greatest staple of the Eisenhower family was religious observance.

30
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.190
The Bible was the guide to family life while speaking of himself in 1948

31
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:55.360
Eisenhower said he was one of the most deeply religious men I know though

32
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.610
unattached to any sector organization.

33
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.500
The Eisenhower home was also a home of patriotism as well as faith and one of

34
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:04.300
respect for the things of the mind,

35
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.390
competition and hard work were staples of the family routine.

36
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.870
Young Eisenhower worked during his spare time at a creamery while he was at

37
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:11.704
school.

38
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.310
Joy was 21 and a half to Abilene.

39
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.100
His destination was the military academy at West Point.

40
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.150
He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry.

41
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.630
He graduated in the middle of his class which came to be known as the class that

42
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.920
the stars fell on because 59 members eventually became general officers in the

43
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:38.330
summer of 1916 as a newly promoted first lieutenant stationed at Fort Sam

44
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.230
Houston,
Texas.
Dwight married Mami Geneva,
doubt of Denver.

45
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.880
She was his wife until Eisenhower,
his death in 1969 events in Europe.

46
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.820
They were forging a new way of life for the entire world.

47
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.330
World War One gave many officers their first experience of combat,

48
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.770
but young Eisenhower was not among them.
It brought him instead.

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.660
Commands have a training center at Gettysburg that he prepared troops of a new

50
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.640
tank coffer overseas deployment.

51
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.220
His performance one him the distinguished service medal.

52
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.970
He was stationed to Europe,
but before he could get there.
The word ended

53
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.160
in the late 90 twice.

54
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:20.420
He's after graduation from the command school and General Staff School.

55
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.740
You a Dwight d Eisenhower was assigned to France to prepare a guidebook on

56
00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:26.240
American battlefields in Europe.

57
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.390
It was his first direct experience with that consonants.

58
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.950
In the 1930s he served under many talents and general such as John Jay Passion

59
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.430
and General Douglas Macarthur in the Philippines.

60
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.270
Eat worked for MacArthur for four years.

61
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:41.930
He was a commander in chief of the Philippine army and he was helping the

62
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:44.930
Commonwealth government work out a plan for its military defense.

63
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.100
Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with Macarthur regarding the

64
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:52.580
leadership qualities that an American army officers should develop in his

65
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:56.390
subordinates.
The resulting animosity between Eisenhower and MacArthur.

66
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.320
It lasted for the rest of their lives or did bags of the United States in

67
00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:03.230
December of 1939 Eisenhower,
it went to Fort Lewis,

68
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:07.250
Washington as an executive officer.
Of the 15th Infantry regiments.

69
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.970
In the dark spring of 1940 German armored divisions were crashing through

70
00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:13.080
Holland and Belgium,
the Luftwaffe herb.

71
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.340
It was streaking its destruction through European skies.

72
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.770
France was being subjugated and Britain was left standing alone.

73
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.860
The United States had passed the selective service act to prepare for what

74
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.210
inevitably layer had.

75
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.230
Late in 1940 Eisenhower was made chief of staff of the Third Infantry Division,

76
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.420
pissed off work,
brought with it an assignment,

77
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:34.550
his chief of staff of the Ninth Army Corps.

78
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.050
In the summer of 1941 he became the chief of staff to cuddle.
Walter Kruger,

79
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.730
who's newly organized Third Army,

80
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:44.540
was preparing to participate in the most realistic war maneuvers is ever held by

81
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:48.170
American troops in these maneuvers over the Louisiana countryside.

82
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.700
Eisenhower's task was to work out a plan of defense against an invading mass

83
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:55.860
force.
Soon the maneuvers were over Ans Eisenhower.

84
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.620
It was promoted to brigadier general.

85
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.770
Then within a matter of days came the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

86
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.550
Although his supervisory abilities had been noticed before entry into World War

87
00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:04.970
Two,

88
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.050
he had never held an active commands above a battalion and it was far from being

89
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.170
considered as a commander of major operations.

90
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.540
From almost this moment on the face of the nation and the feet of General d

91
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:26.680
Eisenhower would be an extra rubbly bound together called to Washington in the

92
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.300
first weeks after the warp.
Again,

93
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.640
Eisenhower went to work in the war plans office.

94
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.090
If the war department's one of the plans formulated during this time was the

95
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:38.920
central strategic determination to make an eventual attack across the English

96
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.460
Channel.
This was to be called the principal allied defensive effort.

97
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.530
Eisenhower's ability to rise to grieve responsibility brought him rapid
promotion

98
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.710
because an all ounce channel invasion would be impossible before 1944 and

99
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.200
because the need for offensive action was immediate.

100
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:05.201
In 1942 the allies undertook a combined operation under the command of General

101
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.540
Dwight d Eisenhower,
and that was the invasion of north Africa.

102
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.010
The minimum objective of this maneuver was to seize the ports between Casablanca

103
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.060
and Algiers along the rim of the North African coast.

104
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.190
Troops were put ashore in late November,

105
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:24.191
encountering resistance ranging from miles in Algiers do surprisingly stiff at

106
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.690
Casablanca.
The command,

107
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:29.660
his hope was to push quickly along the east of the Mediterranean and take

108
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:33.140
possession of the important posts of bezier and Tunis,

109
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.670
but a number of unfavorable circumstances including treacherous weather

110
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:42.260
conditions prompted the commander to hold off on his vital assault in the
spring.

111
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:44.750
However,
troops of Omar Bradley Second Score,

112
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:49.010
we're able to take Bessie a and at the same time Tunis fell to the British first

113
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:53.210
army were these victories.
Well,
that was the end of the Axis Empire in Africa.

114
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.750
The allied leaders and the men who had fought under them proudly commemorated

115
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.530
that victory,
one of the greatest products of the victory in the words,

116
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:04.340
as long as an hour he himself was the progress achieved in the welding of allied

117
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.850
unity and the establishment of a combat team that was already showing the

118
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:11.090
effects of a growing confidence amongst all its members.

119
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.580
The ends of this campaign,
it brought personal recognition.

120
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:16.640
Do Eisenhower throughout the world as him being a great leader.

121
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.320
The comadre himself interpreted this recognition is proof that free men can find

122
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.730
unity in victory,
even against seemingly invincible odds.

123
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.010
The next big campaign,

124
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.450
the invasion of Sicily brought further demonstration of this basic truth.

125
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.600
Allied troops took this vital rock in the summer of 1943 the affects of Sicily's

126
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:47.020
fall.
They were electric.
Italy surrendered the first of the access powers.

127
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.860
Do you capitulate now the ILO is prepared for what was to be the most fiercely

128
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:55.000
fought battle of the Mediterranean war.
The invasion of Italy itself.

129
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.300
It's Atlanta.
Through a miracle of courage and tenacity.

130
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:02.710
Lieutenant General Mark Clark's army established a beachhead overwhelming German

131
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:07.090
odds and taking Salono when's the vital port of Naples with these victories,

132
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:11.260
although heavy fighting an important battles did layer had the first major

133
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:15.910
objectives of the Italy campaign where accomplished ally forces were on European

134
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:19.840
soil and they were able to pin down German troops far from the scene of the

135
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:23.170
cross channel invasion,
which was planned for the following year.

136
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.950
President Roosevelt visited the combat area with General Eisenhower when he came

137
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.140
over.
For the Cairo in Tiran conferences.

138
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.680
Their agreement was once again establish that the principal allied effort would

139
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:35.470
be the invasion of Europe.
Shortly afterwards.

140
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:40.150
The man who would oversee this awesome undertaking was named and yes,

141
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.420
of course it was to be General Dwight David Eisenhower,

142
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.710
people throughout the free world.
We're now calling him the man of the hour.

143
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.490
The Supreme C'mon does orders from the general staff.

144
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:00.900
They were quite simple land on the coast of France and thereafter destroy the

145
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:05.340
German grounds forces.
Yeah.
Between the order and its execution.
Well,

146
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.640
there was certainly going to be a lot of efforts across the channel,

147
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.790
the heavy fortifications lining the coast of France,
bespoke,

148
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.200
the Nazis belief that they could simply push back and the invading army in

149
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.870
France alone at 58 German divisions,
we're waiting.

150
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.490
Preparing for this invasion was a job without let up incessant and realistic

151
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.940
training.
It was of paramount importance,
the challenges of morale,

152
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:30.000
the myriad details of coordination on every level.

153
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.130
All of these were simply overwhelming,

154
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.230
but through these tents months in the early part of 1944 the operations,

155
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.920
they continued finally after being postponed for one day because of weather

156
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:44.010
conditions.
The eve of the day of decision was,
it happens,

157
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.950
but commands have visited the airborne troops.
He would lead the invasion.

158
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.933
He later wrote,

159
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.110
I found the men in fine fessel joshing and assuring me that I had no cause for

160
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.410
worry.
Yes,
with the face of the war hanging in the balance,

161
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.130
Eisenhower felt the weight of the world on his shoulders.

162
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.380
So if you want all of the fun of Basser without,

163
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.520
you know it was a death and the horror and the objects awfulness,

164
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.530
why don't you should probably check out today's sponsor.

168
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:30.260
ads that I don't know if it's a good thing,
but I have all of those platforms,

169
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.530
but the good news is you and you need one of them.
No need to purchase.

You can just download and get players.

physics as well.
It's been sweated over so it's just very,

175
00:11:01.991 --> 00:11:06.210
very good plus sound as good.
The music,
the sounds of facts,
it's all it's,

176
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:09.520
it's just a really excellent and like you can just jump in and play a quick

a challenging tactical situation or if you're hardcore you can try it simulator

180
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.590
and that's one I've never done because I don't like how he may ask wept over and

184
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.550
Let's get into the rest of them.

185
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:45.810
<v 4>Moving.</v>

186
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.140
<v 0>The largest invasion force in the history of mankind to crossing the English</v>

187
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:53.320
channel was a huge logistical challenge.
But the success of the enterprise,

188
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:57.850
it was largely dependence on something outside of Eisenhower's control and that

189
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.890
was the weather.
With the arrival of June,

190
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:03.610
there were just four days of potential good weather that Eisenhower could work

191
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:04.630
with the invasion.

192
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.110
It was planned for June the fifth but then bad weather rolled in on the fourth

193
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:10.210
with the expectation of more to come.

194
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.230
Eisenhower therefore considered per spooning the invasion on the other side of

195
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.280
the channel,
the Germans,

196
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.430
they were confident that there would be no invasion attempt to during the

197
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.600
inclement weather and it was at this point that the supreme allied commander how

198
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:26.830
to decision to make and finally he told his generals items and like it,

199
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.040
but we have to go on June the fifth at 9:45 PM he gave the order for the

200
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:36.910
landings to begin the following morning on June the sixth he said,
okay,

201
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.210
that's go.
He then addressed the salmon,
the sailors,

202
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.240
the troops of his command stating you are about to embark on the great crusade.

203
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.970
The eyes of the world are upon you and company with our brave allies and

204
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:50.860
brothers in arms on other fronts.

205
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.370
You will bring about the destruction of the German war machine and the

206
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.940
elimination of Nazi tyranny.
Your task will not be an easy one.

207
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.270
Your enemy is well trained and well equipped and battle hardened.

208
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.480
We will accept nothing less than full victory.

209
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.030
Good luck and let us besiege the best thing of all mighty God upon this great a

210
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:12.160
noble undertaking in the wallets.
If the supreme commands,
uh,

211
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.170
allied expeditionary force,
however,

212
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.320
was secrets at the following note dated June the fifth,

213
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.580
our landings in the shoebox Harv area have failed to gain a satisfactory

214
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:23.830
footballs and dive withdrawn the trips.

215
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.580
My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information

216
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.570
available.
The troops,
the air in the Navy did all that.

217
00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:34.870
The bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the

218
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:39.250
attempts,
it is mine alone.
Those last two words,
mine alone.

219
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.450
They were underlined by Eisenhower at 3:00 AM on June the sixth President

220
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:46.660
Roosevelt was telephones with the information that operation overlord was

221
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:47.320
underway.

222
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.830
Just two days Nasssa Eisenhower was able to report to as president that the

223
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:53.560
operation was a success throughout d day.

224
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.590
June the six 156,115 men landed on the beaches of Normandy.

225
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.960
By the end of June in excess of eight 150,000 men along with 570,000 tons of

226
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:08.200
supplies and 148,000 vehicles,
they were on French soil.

227
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.050
The unstoppable march to Berlin was underway,

228
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.640
but also surrender came on May the seventh 1945 the Japanese followed just four

229
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.020
months later,
but only after the u s dropped two atomic bombs on their people.

230
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.950
Eisenhower was opposed to the dropping of the bombs after they were unleashed.

231
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:28.210
He said first the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to

232
00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:30.580
hit them with that awful thing.
Second,

233
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.480
I hated to see our country be the first to use central weapon

234
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.090
for Dwight Eisenhower.

235
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.690
That return from war was matched with the chairs of people from all over the

236
00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:48.490
world and his own homelands.
A hero's welcome away.
Him,

237
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.000
despite his desire to enter retirement in America,

238
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.980
had other tasks waiting for their favorite soldier.
He succeeded.

239
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:58.310
General Marshall is the army's first post war chief of staff.

240
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.090
He expressed belief that one of the greatest pillars of world peace was a strong

241
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:06.110
United States and visited troops,
stations in various parts of the worlds,

242
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.190
and encouraged America's growing sense of global responsibility,

243
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.580
saying we must remain the first champions of those who seek peace in their own

244
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:16.700
lives and peace with their neighbors.
Finally,

245
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.350
on February the seventh 1948 the general from Abilene after 36 years of service

246
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:24.920
to his country,
left active military assignment.
He did not,
however,

247
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.410
leave active participation in the life of his nation.

248
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.490
He accepted an invitation from Columbia University to serve as president of that

249
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:32.960
institution at the time.

250
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.960
He thought that this would enable him to devote the remainder of his time on

251
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:38.060
earth to the challenges of education,

252
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.330
but events of the postwar wells they dictated.
Otherwise,

253
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.480
the urgent need for unity in the free world brought into being the North

254
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.930
Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO.

255
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.830
It soon became clear that there was only one man who could make that vital and

256
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:55.070
complicated organization work,
and that was Eisenhower.

257
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.550
At the ends of 1950 he answered this country is called one small wins.

258
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.300
He again was on European soil to take supreme commands of the land,

259
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.040
the sea and the air force's.

260
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:07.490
If a grant is defensive alliance against the new threat of rising from the

261
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:10.160
Soviets who had previously been his nation's ally.

262
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.100
He had to create within the war where a European soul,

263
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.790
the will to defend itself so that freedom so dearly bought,

264
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.220
would not be lost for more than a year.

265
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:22.850
He labored diligently at his task of coalition when he turned over the reigns of

266
00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:24.530
commands and General Matthew Ridgway,

267
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.030
the structure of military unity among the free nations upon which rested the

268
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.000
hope for continued peace.
It was well established

269
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.190
once again with the establishment of substantial victory behind him.

270
00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:44.970
This might well have been the ends of Eisenhower's Public Korea.
Indeed,

271
00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.190
this was the end of Eisenhower.
The soldier,

272
00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:50.220
but it was just the beginning of Eisenhower,
the statesmen,

273
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.260
although we had shown no interest in politics,

274
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:56.640
Eisenhower was pursued as a presidential candidates by both the Republicans and

275
00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:57.450
the Democrats.

276
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.200
This satisfied with the Democrats over their handling of the Korean War and

277
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.270
charges of corruption within the White House.

278
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.810
Eisenhower decided to join the Republican's and run for office.

279
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.470
He felt that the country needs attendant as he watched the country going in the

280
00:17:10.471 --> 00:17:11.260
wrong direction.

281
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.940
He knew that he was the right man to get things back on track beyond just

282
00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:18.600
military reputation.
Eisenhower was a very charismatic individual.

283
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.920
I like high quiz more than just a campaign slogan.
It was the true sentiment.

284
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.640
He was seen as a decent man who was willing to put himself forward to do what

285
00:17:26.641 --> 00:17:30.510
was right for the country when what he truly deserved was to live out.

286
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.860
His final years in peace and seclusion is overwhelming popularity.

287
00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:38.670
It catapulted him to the White House and while most people liked and trusted

288
00:17:38.671 --> 00:17:43.160
[inaudible],
they weren't always sure that he was engaged in Oval Office fas.

289
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.390
A lot of people felt that it was simply presiding.

290
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:49.380
Over an administration and others weren't really making the decisions.
However,

291
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:52.020
although we had a reputation for being out to lunch,

292
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.080
every major policy decision really was his decision.

293
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.080
It was really him who was calling the shots.

294
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.910
In his first significant accomplishments,

295
00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.100
Eisenhower brought about an end to the Korean War,

296
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.070
forging an armistice that is still in effect today.

297
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.130
While his military career has been built on waging war now,

298
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:12.000
it appeared that he was determined to use this presidency to pursue peace.

299
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.450
He began downsizing the military by spending less money on defense.

300
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:19.680
He believed that America could spend more on infrastructure and quality of life.

301
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.120
He went from orchestrating the largest military operation in history to pushing

302
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:27.210
the world's largest public works project through Congress.

303
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.350
The Federal Highway Act One Americans welcomes the change to their landscape.

304
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:34.530
They were not receptive to other changes to that culture.

305
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.340
One of the great unresolved issues after World War II was whether or not African

306
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:42.210
Americans would continue to be forced to live in a segregated society.

307
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.460
In 1954 the supreme court banned racial segregation in public schools and it's

308
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.320
landmark ruling of Brown versus board of Education.

309
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.530
Although Eisenhower had appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren,

310
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.140
the motivating force behind the revolutionary ruling,

311
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.550
Eisenhower publicly distanced himself from the decision considering it to be a

312
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:02.910
disruptive and inappropriate role for the federal governments in his eyes,

313
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:05.490
the country.
It was not yet ready for desegregation.

314
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.880
Words that he shared with Warren in privates,
they confirmed this.

315
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.450
Eisenhower asked him to consider the perspective of white parents in the deep

316
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:15.570
south.
These are not bad people.
The precedent set,

317
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.470
all they are concerned about is to see that this sweet little girls and not

318
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:22.950
required to sit in school alongside some big black box.

319
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:27.660
In 1954 after the French were defeated in Vietnam and the country was Spittin to

320
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.100
Eisenhower pledged his support for the pro western government of South Vietnam

321
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.630
over the communist run north.

322
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.590
It took a series of steps that were central to America's growing involvement in

323
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:38.310
Vietnam.

324
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.090
The most important was the creation of the Bank of Vietnam through which huge

325
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:44.070
sums of money was sent to South Vietnam.

326
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:49.071
For Aid and support under leadership America enjoyed peace and great prosperity

327
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:51.720
during his first time with the economy soaring.

328
00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:56.010
He easily won reelection in 1956 and interesting note here is that during his

329
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:56.611
presidency,

330
00:19:56.611 --> 00:20:00.780
Eisenhower was on the maiden flight of Air Force One which replaced the previous

331
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:01.980
presidential aircraft.

332
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.180
The Columbine traditionally second presidential Thames much tougher than the

333
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:09.210
first,
and this was certainly true for Eisenhower.
First,

334
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:13.800
he had health concerns suffering a heart attack in 1955 that's combined with his

335
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.820
aloof reactions,
do growing civil rights unrest made him seem rather weak.

336
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.250
Then came Sputnik,

337
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.790
the first satellite in space launched by the Soviets in 1957 Americans,

338
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.850
they became hysterical believing that there was a missile and GAF and the

339
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:27.780
Russians favor.

340
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.490
In 1959 Fidel Castro seize power in Cuba establishing a revolutionary regime

341
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:34.350
just 90 miles from Florida.

342
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.160
That was another sign that America was losing out to the Soviets.

343
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.910
That was now a feeling that communism was overwhelming America.

344
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.410
The grandfatherly image that Eisenhower had enjoyed was now seen as a bit of a

345
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.760
liability and his final address to the nation.

346
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.990
He spoke to the American people with unprecedented candor.

347
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.230
He warns that Americans must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted

348
00:20:56.231 --> 00:21:00.640
influence by the military industrial complex for a military man,
yet alone,

349
00:21:00.641 --> 00:21:04.060
the general who had been the supreme commander of the allied forces.

350
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.900
This was a stunning pronouncement,
the hero of World War II.

351
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.770
He wants it nothing more than to leave behind a presidential legacy of peace to

352
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:16.480
him,
a man who had fought and seen firsthand the destruction of war combat.

353
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.720
It always had to be the very last resort

354
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.150
in accordance with the 22nd amendment to the u s constitution.

355
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.080
Eisenhower was the first president to be affected by the prohibition on running

356
00:21:33.081 --> 00:21:37.370
for a third time following the end of his second term in January of 1961 his

357
00:21:37.371 --> 00:21:41.440
commission as a five star general was reinstated and he took up residence to a

358
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.140
working farm opposite the Getty's filled battlefield and Pennsylvania.

359
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.790
Throughout the 1960s Eisenhower gave his influential support to a number of

360
00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:53.210
Republican politicians,
including Barry Goldwater in Richard Nixon.

361
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:58.220
When Nixon won the presidency in 1968 Eisenhower comments is that it was a day

362
00:21:58.221 --> 00:22:03.221
for rejoicing Eisenhower Diet on March the 28th 1969 of congestive heart

363
00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:05.990
failure.
He was 78 years of age.

364
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.350
He was eulogized by President Nixon with the following words.

365
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.410
Some men are considered great because they lead great armies,

366
00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:15.620
or they lead powerful nations.
For eight years now,

367
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.100
Dwight Eisenhower has neither commands and Denomie nor led the nation,

368
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.620
and yet he remains through his final days,

369
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.290
the world's most admired and respected man,

370
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.910
truly the first citizen of the world.
