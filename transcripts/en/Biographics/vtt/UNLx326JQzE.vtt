<v Speaker 1>just before we get started into this one today,</v>

4
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I do want to say that a lot of Japanese words,</v>

5
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>if I scrub the pronunciations,</v>

6
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I did my best.</v>

7
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Have a good at me in the comments below if you want that spot there for</v>

8
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>me and motive muscle sheet was the greatest swordsman you rather come out of a</v>

9
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>nation of great swordsman and that would of course in Japan.</v>

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>His story which has become the basis for countless flying swords and an oriental</v>

11
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>movies is one of raw courage,</v>

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>unbridled ambition,</v>

13
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>and unparalleled mindfulness in one on one combat.</v>

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>He defeated 16 opponents,</v>

15
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>yet his greatest legacy is a seminal work.</v>

16
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>The book of five rings,</v>

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>which is still poor,</v>

18
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>dover by military tacticians and mindfulness,</v>

19
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic for 150 years after it was written.</v>

20
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

21
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>we reveal the man that was Masashi</v>

22
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>there as much uncertainty over the details and dates pertaining to the life of</v>

23
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Masashi.</v>

24
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>What follows is based primarily on his own account,</v>

25
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>as recorded in the book of five rings,</v>

26
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 1>me and massage Masashi was born in the spring of 15,</v>

27
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 1>84 in the village of Mia Moto in the Yoshino districts of the Masaka province in</v>

28
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

29
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.150
<v Speaker 1>He was born into an ability with his mother who died giving birth to him being</v>

30
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of a minor local chief Tang.</v>

31
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>His father Mooney was a warrior in the Shin Man Clan who had become an experts</v>

32
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>in the fighting arts.</v>

33
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>He was especially adept at Jujitsu swordsmanship and the use of the guitar.</v>

34
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>An iron rod with forklift protrusions when he was in his thirties.</v>

35
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Mooney had been invited to the capital of Kyoto to deal with another highly</v>

36
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>regarded warrior in the presence of the Shogun Mooney beat the man in two out of</v>

37
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:41.594
<v Speaker 1>three bouts.</v>

38
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>The victory established and massage his father as he whole show,</v>

39
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>which means without equal in Japan,</v>

40
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>really was intense on teaching his son everything that he knew about the</v>

41
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>fighting arts.</v>

42
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Although Misashi it was a quick learner.</v>

43
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>He had a stubborn streak that sort of constantly clashing with his father.</v>

44
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>While everyone else treated me with the utmost respect and reverence,</v>

45
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Misashi would often talk back and criticize his father.</v>

46
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in a volatile relationship which often culminated in violence.</v>

47
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

48
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Muni took a knife and threw it at his son was actually managed to dodge the</v>

49
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:13.341
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>

50
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>which buried itself in the wall beside him,</v>

51
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but the fathers aren't get it was not over.</v>

52
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.181
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

53
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>through the seven year old boy out of the house,</v>

54
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>essentially disowning him was actually crossed,</v>

55
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>become a soccer pass to the province of Hiroshima where he traveled to the small</v>

56
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 1>village of [inaudible].</v>

57
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Here he was taken in by his uncle,</v>

58
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>dearin.</v>

59
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Dearin has once been a warrior,</v>

60
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>but he had long ago renounced the fighting arts,</v>

61
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 1>becoming a Buddhist monk and is living a life of study and meditation.</v>

62
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>He raised Misashi at is small Buddhist temples,</v>

63
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>sat on the edge of the village here,</v>

64
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>the coin lands to read and to write as well as to meditate and develop the</v>

65
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>spirituality,</v>

66
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.680
<v Speaker 1>massaging his real passion.</v>

67
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

68
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>lay with a martial arts.</v>

69
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>He spends countless hours alone in the woods,</v>

70
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.700
<v Speaker 1>sparring against the unforgiving trunks of pine trees.</v>

71
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>His anger at his being released as he builds upon the skills that had been</v>

72
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>instilled by that great worry out and his work for book of five rings.</v>

73
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Misashi recorded that his first real fight occurred when he was 13 years of age.</v>

74
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He related that to passing warrior by the name of Mickey High.</v>

75
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I put a sign up along the Ohio River,</v>

76
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>challenging any local swordsman to a deal.</v>

77
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>The bolds and impetus Misashi took up the challenge,</v>

78
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>writing his name on the sign,</v>

79
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>key high,</v>

80
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>considered the challenge and joke,</v>

81
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but accepted any way intent on teaching the young upstart or lesson ms dot</v>

82
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Ashley's Uncle Doren with sharks.</v>

83
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>When he heard what his nephew had done on the day of the challenge,</v>

84
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>she went to head of the buyer and attempted to beg us off while he was eating</v>

85
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>with key high misashi challenged his opponents with a six foot quarter staff.</v>

86
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>He caught off guard,</v>

87
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>clubbing him to the ground,</v>

88
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>and then striking him between the eyes with a succession of blows.</v>

89
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>He then beat him to death.</v>

90
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.711
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

91
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Masashi left Heroku and set off to make his way in the world.</v>

92
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>He traveled along the sand Yoda,</v>

93
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>the old high road scouting the northern shore of the inland sea to the streets</v>

94
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>of Shem on Saqib.</v>

95
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>From that,</v>

96
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>he ferried across the waters to the port of [inaudible] and then onto knack at</v>

97
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Psu.</v>

98
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>This was the castle town,</v>

99
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>whereas father now lives moody had entered into the service of the master of</v>

100
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Nicodemus,</v>

101
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you causal.</v>

102
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>The teenager arrived to find his father's on me.</v>

103
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>We're in the midst of a campaign,</v>

104
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:15.261
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

105
00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>do the islands of shoe and wage war on the western provinces was actually,</v>

107
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>was recruited into the force and soon found himself fighting alongside his</v>

108
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

109
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It was his first taste of war.</v>

110
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>The campaign proved to be a great success with two provinces being brought onto</v>

111
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 1>the dominion of your Shitaka.</v>

112
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Following the campaign with Sashi,</v>

113
00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>his aging father retired from active duty moving to the nearby port of kids.</v>

114
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Suki.</v>

115
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

116
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>as the father exited from the wells of mortal Kombat of a sudden it was just</v>

117
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>getting started.</v>

118
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>That campaign,</v>

119
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>it had wet his appetite and he was eager for more in terms of becoming a great</v>

120
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>warrior or swordsmen like his father.</v>

121
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>He set out a path forward.</v>

122
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>He needed to perfect the art of swordsmanship,</v>

123
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>seek out and defeat other masters and then found his own school of swordsman</v>

124
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:00.604
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

125
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Never one to think small.</v>

126
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Misashi had set his sights on the most prestigious school of swordsmanship in</v>

127
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 1>the realm the famous Yoshioka clowning in Kyoto.</v>

128
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.700
<v Speaker 1>He knew that if he could fully defeat even one member of this plan,</v>

129
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>he would put himself on the fast track to recognition as a master swordsman,</v>

130
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>so without saying a word to his father,</v>

131
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>he rose early one morning,</v>

132
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 1>collected his few belongings and set out to claim his destiny.</v>

133
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.880
<v Speaker 1>He bought it his way onto a small merchant vessel to the port of Sakaki.</v>

134
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.481
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>

135
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 1>he sat on foot ticket Jojo and sought out the Yoshioka can.</v>

136
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>He threw down his challenge,</v>

137
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>which was easily accepted by their top swordsman.</v>

138
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.423
<v Speaker 1>St Jerome.</v>

139
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.880
<v Speaker 1>The jewel would take place on the grounds of the temple.</v>

140
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you really have to the venue?</v>

141
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Masashi leapt upon his opponent without wanting,</v>
