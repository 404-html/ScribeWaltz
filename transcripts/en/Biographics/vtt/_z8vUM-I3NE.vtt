1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Born a slave,</v>

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>he rose to become a prominence abolitionist,</v>

3
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.910
<v Speaker 1>statesmen,</v>

4
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.870
<v Speaker 1>author and respected figure around the world the most photographed</v>

5
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:09.790
<v Speaker 1>african-american of the 19th century.</v>

6
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>He was also a recognizable figure even as his very identity put him at risk for</v>

7
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>much of his life.</v>

8
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Frederick Douglass story is one of perseverance,</v>

9
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>intellects,</v>

10
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>and then an unending desire for freedom and justice.</v>

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Frederick Douglas wasn't born with that name,</v>

12
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>noisy born on the day that he later adopted as his best date of birth.</v>

13
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>He was christened Frederick Augustus,</v>

14
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Washington Bailey.</v>

15
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>The date he was born has been lost to history.</v>

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.951
<v Speaker 1>Later in life.</v>

17
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>You decided that February the 14th would be the day on which he marked his</v>

18
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>entrance into the wells.</v>

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

20
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I have no accurate knowledge of my age,</v>

21
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>never having seen any authentic record containing this is what he wrote in a</v>

22
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass.</v>

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>We do know though that Douglass was born into slavery in Marilyn's likely the</v>

24
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>son of a union between his mother and that owner,</v>

25
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.021
<v Speaker 1>Douglass.</v>

26
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>His mother was known for her intelligence and is widely considered to be the</v>

27
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 1>only slave who could read or write in the area of Maryland's where she lived,</v>

28
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but was never really got to know his mother.</v>

29
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It was common for infants born to slaves to be separated from their mothers.</v>

30
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Soon after birth.</v>

31
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Taking care of children took up energy and time that the younger women could use</v>

32
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>to doing hard work on the farm or the plantation.</v>

33
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Older women who weren't able to do such physical neighbor could take care of</v>

34
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>children and slave masters wouldn't see a drop in productivity.</v>

35
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So Douglas,</v>

36
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>like many slaves,</v>

37
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>he grew up without his mother.</v>

38
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>He was sent to live with his grandmother that he bailey.</v>

39
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>She was also the caretaker for 12 other children don't miss.</v>

40
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>His mother was enslaved at a different plantation here.</v>

41
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And you saw how a handful of times before he was removed from his grandmother's</v>

42
00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>house at around age seven,</v>

43
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was separated from the family that he knew he was taken from his</v>

44
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>grandmother's home and was sent to y plantation plantation.</v>

45
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>He joined a thousand other slaves spread across 20 farms owned bite master Lloyd</v>

46
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Douglas.</v>

47
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 1>He didn't work in the fields.</v>

48
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>He was still young and so he didn't go out.</v>

49
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

50
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you cared for the families,</v>

51
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.330
<v Speaker 1>cows and tended to the houses garden and it's yacht.</v>

52
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It was while he was at this farm that his mother died and then once again,</v>

53
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>ductless was operated as a slave.</v>

54
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Douglass was forced to move and serve the winds of his masters.</v>

55
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>This time he was sent to Baltimore to the family of Hugh old here.</v>

56
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Douglas followed in his mother's footsteps.</v>

57
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>He learns to read and write is journey to literacy.</v>

58
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>It started when Sophia,</v>

59
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>old Hugh's wife again teaching him the lessons of the alphabet.</v>

60
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It was unusual for a slave owner.</v>

61
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 1>It's takes so much interest in the education of a safe and he did not like that.</v>

62
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>His wife was doing site plus all sorts that have slaves,</v>

63
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>could read and write so they would be more likely to want their freedom and more</v>

64
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>likely to seek it out.</v>

65
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Douglas called all those arguments against literacy.</v>

66
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>His first decidedly anti slavery lecture.</v>

67
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.871
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

68
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Sophia came around to her husband's way of thinking and Douglas is tutoring</v>

69
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.974
<v Speaker 1>sessions.</v>

70
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>They came to an end,</v>

71
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>but douglass believed that once you learn to read,</v>

72
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you will be forever free,</v>

73
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and so he kept that name.</v>

74
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>He taught himself to read,</v>

75
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>grabbing any publication that had words on it.</v>

76
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Newspapers and political pamphlets joins books in his collection,</v>

77
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>and Douglas began to learn much more than how to read.</v>

78
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>He was learning about the events of the country and the rest of the world.</v>

79
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Among the publications he devoured was the Colombian or race.</v>

80
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>At this book was an 18th century unfollow gig that was used as a literacy</v>

81
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 1>teaching tool in classrooms for Douglas.</v>

82
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Though the book offered more than just a lesson in reading and writing,</v>

83
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it gave him an insight into ideas about freedom.</v>

84
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's about human rights was he didn't want to keep the power of literacy to</v>

85
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:50.021
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

86
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Though he started teaching other slaves from nearby plantations to read during</v>

87
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Sunday school using the New Testament's,</v>

88
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>dozens of slaves would show up each week to learn.</v>

89
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Amazingly just went unnoticed for nearly six months,</v>

90
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>but when it was discovered that Douglas was teaching fellow slaves to read and</v>

91
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

92
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>the slave owners were beside themselves with anger.</v>

93
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>One Sunday while Douglas was teaching ve fuming owners bust into the makeshift</v>

94
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

95
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>they were intense that they're slaves would not learn to read and write,</v>

96
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>and they use violence to get that point across.</v>

97
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 1>They used stones and clubs to ends that Sunday meeting and to end Dr says</v>

98
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>teaching for the time.</v>

99
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Being.</v>

100
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was still a teenager when this happened,</v>

101
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>since he was already beginning to make his mark on the world.</v>

102
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>By the time Douglas had his teens,</v>

103
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>he had also been moved from owner to owner and plantation to plantation.</v>

104
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Several times in his late teens,</v>

105
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Douglas were sent to be a slave for Edward Coby,</v>

106
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>coby subjected to violence regularly beating and whipping him and his book,</v>

107
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>my bondage and my freedom.</v>

108
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Douglas entitles the chapter devoted to his time on covese plantation as Colby,</v>

109
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the Negro breaker.</v>

110
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>He rides if the beatings,</v>

111
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.030
<v Speaker 1>he sustained it covese hands.</v>

112
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I had not been in his possession three whole days before.</v>

113
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You subjected me to almost brutal chastisements onto his heavy blows.</v>

114
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Blood flowed freely and Wales will left on my back as large as my middle finger.</v>

115
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>The sores on my back from this flogging continued for weeks for they were kept</v>

116
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>open by the rough and coarse cloth which I wore for shouting.</v>

117
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Douglass began to fight back.</v>

118
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>He gave covey a taste of his own medicine,</v>

119
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.700
<v Speaker 1>and the man never tried to use violence to control douglas game,</v>

120
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.553
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Near.</v>

121
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't continue life as a slave beyond his own beliefs and desire for</v>

122
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

123
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>He had also met a woman who inspired him to seek his own freedom,</v>

124
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and Maria was a free black woman from Baltimore.</v>

125
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>She not only inspire to douglass freedom,</v>

126
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but fell in love with him.</v>

127
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>The two of them,</v>

128
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>they later got married in 1836.</v>

129
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Douglas first attempted to escape from slavery.</v>

130
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 1>When his plan was discovered,</v>

131
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>he was thrown in jail,</v>

132
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.830
<v Speaker 1>return to his own head.</v>

133
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Douglas remained a slave for two more years before he able to make another</v>

134
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.731
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>

135
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Attempts on September the third,</v>

136
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.681
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

137
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>38,</v>

138
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Douglas took the risk that he knew could either start his life as a free man or</v>

139
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>end it altogether.</v>

140
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I felt assured that if I failed in this attempt to my case would be a hopeless</v>

141
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

142
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It would seal my fate as a slave forever.</v>

143
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>He later wrote he had obtained papers showing him to be a free man,</v>

144
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>a risky move in and of itself.</v>

145
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>The neighbors belonged to a black sailor and so douglas hats to act the part if</v>

146
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to be successful before leaving his master's property in Baltimore.</v>

147
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't this costumed himself in a red shirt,</v>

148
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>black revamps and the sales hat while he disguised himself with his clothes.</v>

149
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>The plan still had one big floor.</v>

150
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Douglas wasn't a great physical match for the description on the haters.</v>

151
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>If an official stopped to closely consider the measurements and the description</v>

152
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>is journey to freedom,</v>

153
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.893
<v Speaker 1>it would be over.</v>

154
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Douglas boarded a train to Philadelphia,</v>

155
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>and as expected,</v>

156
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>he faced an inspection when he was asked to show free papers.</v>

157
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Douglas handed over his sailors identification and said,</v>

158
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I never carry my free papers to see with me.</v>

159
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I have a paper with the American Eagle on us that will carry me around the</v>

160
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

161
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>The answer and the papers were enough for the conductor.</v>

162
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was free to stay on the train and to continue his journey,</v>

163
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>but he still had to make it through slave states.</v>

164
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>When he risked getting arrested after an anxious journey,</v>

165
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Douglas stepped off the train in New York and made his way to a group of</v>

166
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 1>underground railroad activists.</v>

167
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>He was in a free state,</v>

168
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>but it was not a free man.</v>

169
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>He was technically a fugitive,</v>

170
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 1>so could still be arrested.</v>

171
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>The danger was definitely not over for him yet.</v>

172
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

173
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>he was ecstatic to simply be in one of these free states.</v>

174
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I've often been asked how I felt when first I found myself on free soil.</v>

175
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.340
<v Speaker 1>There is scarcity.</v>

176
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Anything in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory</v>

177
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 1>answer and new world had opened upon me,</v>

178
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>if life is more than breath ends,</v>

179
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the quick rounds of blood.</v>

180
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I lived more in one day and then a year of my slave life.</v>

181
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It was a time of Jonah's excitement,</v>

182
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>which words can,</v>

183
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but team the describe the underground railroad activists provided them shelter</v>

184
00:07:53.191 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>for a day and got words to his beloved Anna that he was free.</v>

185
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>She made her way up for Baltimore and the two were married in New York.</v>

186
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Within days there a couple of world further north to Massachusetts where life</v>

187
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 1>was somewhat safer for a fugitive slave that was still prejudice.</v>

188
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:07.581
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

189
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>in Douglas had to work hard to find even the menial jobs where you could earn a</v>

190
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

191
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.553
<v Speaker 1>While in new Bedford.</v>

192
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Douglas became a licensed preacher.</v>

193
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Auntie taught Sunday school and served as church sexton.</v>

194
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>They also became involved in the abolitionist movements.</v>

195
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was inspired by abolitionist.</v>

196
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>William Lloyd Garrison and avidly read his newspaper,</v>

197
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.873
<v Speaker 1>the liberator.</v>

198
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>The first time Douglas was asked to speak as an abolitionist meeting.</v>

199
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.863
<v Speaker 1>He was frightened.</v>

200
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>He had been unexpectedly asked to give a speech at the Massachusetts antislavery</v>

201
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>societies national convention.</v>

202
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Through his nervousness,</v>

203
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>he gave an incredibly eloquent and thoughtful speech,</v>

204
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.280
<v Speaker 1>unlikely white abolitionists who gave most antislavery speeches.</v>

205
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Douglas could speak personally about the pain and the brutality of slavery,</v>

206
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.403
<v Speaker 1>douglass skill,</v>

207
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.981
<v Speaker 1>public speaking.</v>

208
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>It was quickly noticed and he talks more and more at antislavery meetings and</v>

209
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>soon he was a key part of the abolitionist movements.</v>

210
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.101
<v Speaker 1>At meetings,</v>

211
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>he would tell his story and rouse crowds to the course.</v>

212
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.101
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

213
00:08:59.101 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>43,</v>

214
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>he joins the American antislavery society to toward the midwestern United States</v>

215
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>and speak about the importance of abolishing slavery.</v>

216
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>They traveled for six months spreading their message,</v>

217
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so often putting themselves in danger.</v>

218
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>This was two decades before the civil war and slavery supporters wanted to make</v>

219
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>themselves heard.</v>

220
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>They turns violence on some occasions,</v>

221
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>and Douglas had his hands broken during one melly and Indiana Douglas didn't</v>

222
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>just put his oratory skills to work for the abolitionist movement.</v>

223
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Though he also wrote his autobiography,</v>

224
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>telling the story of what it was like to grow up and if a slave titled</v>

225
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Narrative,</v>

226
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>the autobiography of Frederick Douglass,</v>

227
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the book was a huge success.</v>

228
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>It had nine reprinting and was translated so that it can be sold in Europe as</v>

229
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

230
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>The success of the book that came with a cost,</v>

231
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>though it attracted attention to Douglas and he was still not a free man in the</v>

232
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:47.034
<v Speaker 1>eyes of the law.</v>

233
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going into hiding in the United States,</v>

234
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 1>though Douglas headed to Europe,</v>

235
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>that he was safe from arrest and could continue spreading his message and</v>

236
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>telling his story.</v>

237
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>During a two year tour of England and Ireland,</v>

238
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 1>he raised his profile both back home and in Europe.</v>

239
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Crowds came to see him speak and some twists.</v>

240
00:10:02.021 --> 00:10:03.850
<v Speaker 1>His appeal that is European support it.</v>

241
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It's began raising money to buy his freedom in America.</v>

242
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was also impressed with Europe.</v>

243
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>He was treated like a person.</v>

244
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>They're unlike.</v>

245
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't home instead of a democratic governments.</v>

246
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm under a monarchical governments.</v>

247
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Instead of the bright blue skies of America,</v>

248
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm covered with a softer gray fog of the emerald aisle.</v>

249
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I breathe hands low.</v>

250
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 1>The Chattel becomes a man I gave around in vain for one who will question my</v>

251
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>equal humanity,</v>

252
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 1>claimed me as a slave or offer me an insult.</v>

253
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference</v>

254
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 1>paid to white people,</v>

255
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>and I go to church.</v>

256
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm met by no upturns,</v>

257
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:40.460
<v Speaker 1>nose and scornful lip to tell me we don't sell our niggas.</v>

258
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 1>His supporters were successful in raising the funds to buy douglass his freedom,</v>

260
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and he was able to return to America,</v>

261
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>to his wife,</v>

262
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 1>and to the course of freeing the millions of slaves in the country.</v>

263
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 1>He started publishing his own paper,</v>

264
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:53.754
<v Speaker 1>the North Star,</v>

265
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>and also took up causes of freedom beyond the abolitionist movements.</v>

266
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 1>He spoke at the women's rights,</v>

267
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Seneca falls convention calling for women to be granted the right to vote.</v>

268
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>He also became active in cooling for the desegregation of schools.</v>

269
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a full century before Brown and board of education was decided by the</v>

270
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.603
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Court</v>

271
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>because of his activism and this perpetual presence in the abolitionist and</v>

272
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:25.314
<v Speaker 1>other movements,</v>

273
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was a highly recognized figure in America when the civil war began</v>

274
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>during the walk.</v>

275
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Douglas is a fierce advocate of allowing African Americans to fight for the</v>

276
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>union.</v>

277
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.570
<v Speaker 1>A war undertaken and brazenly carried for the petrol enslavement of the colored</v>

278
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:43.190
<v Speaker 1>man calls logically and loudly for the colored men to help suppress it.</v>

279
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Douglas even have the ear of Abraham Lincoln and was able to speak to the</v>

280
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:49.490
<v Speaker 1>president about his views on African American troops.</v>

281
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>He used his publications and speeches to call for the inclusion of African</v>

282
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Americans in the army for two years.</v>

283
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>He kept working on this issue.</v>

284
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.511
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

285
00:11:58.511 --> 00:11:59.140

287
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>join the army.</v>

288
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Douglas and his family were ready to have a son signed up to fight.</v>

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Under third became active in recruitments.</v>

290
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Douglas himself shifted his message from encouraging the inclusion of African</v>

291
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Americans in the military to encouraging African Americans to sign up to fight.</v>

295
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>countrymen who have fallen in the sanguinary ans wicked strife.</v>

296
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.280
<v Speaker 1>When grim massaged war has moved his wrinkled front and our country,</v>

297
00:12:34.281 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>you shall have regained its normal condition as a leader of nations in the</v>

301
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Nobody said this in the long list of glory composed of men,</v>

302
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>of all nations,</v>

303
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>there appears the name of no colored man.</v>

304
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>When the civil war ended,</v>

305
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Speaker 1>slavery was outlawed.</v>

306
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Douglas did not step away from public life.</v>

307
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>He believed that was still much work to be done in the fight for freedom.</v>

308
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 1>He was appointed president if the Freedman's bank,</v>

309
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>which helped promote economic development in the newly free African American</v>

310
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 1>communities and also continued speaking around the country and was active in</v>

312
00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>68 campaign for the presidency.</v>

313
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Then in 18,</v>

314
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 1>72,</v>

315
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.180
<v Speaker 1>douglas was nominated as Victoria woodhull,</v>

316
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>his vice presidential running mate.</v>

317
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even know it had been nominated.</v>

318
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>He didn't seek it out,</v>

319
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but the equal rights party,</v>

320
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.450
<v Speaker 1>but in one of the tickets nonetheless,</v>

321
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be as lost appearance in a presidential race.</v>

322
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.151
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

323
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:31.541
<v Speaker 1>88,</v>

324
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>he became the first African American to receive a vote for presidents as a major</v>

325
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 1>party's convention.</v>

326
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>His fame and his outspoken activism still made him a target for sinister</v>

327
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:40.751
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

328
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

329
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the same year he was nominated as a vice presidential candidate.</v>

330
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 1>His family's New York home was targeted by an arsonist.</v>

331
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 1>The family was safe,</v>

332
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 1>but the far show that he nor his African-american Bretheran was still not safe</v>

333
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>from violence even years after the civil war and ended</v>

334
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Douglas spent the last two decades of his life in Washington dc where he served</v>

335
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:11.430

338
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:15.891
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's children were upset and this was his new wife's family.</v>

344
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.150
<v Speaker 1>During the 18 eighties,</v>

345
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600
<v Speaker 1>he continued traveling both the country and the world,</v>

346

<v Speaker 1>He said often diplomatic positions as recorder of deeds for DC into commission</v>

353
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

355
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Douglas was speaking and crusading for rice right until the end of his life in</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was incredibly well received,</v>

359
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but it was the last speech he would ever give.</v>

360
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after the speech,</v>

361
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>he had a heart attack and passed away.</v>

368
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>but every time he put himself out there as a public figure,</v>

369
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.450
<v Speaker 1>advocating for an end to slavery,</v>

370

<v Speaker 1>the right to vote and civil rights for all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>is denied,</v>

373
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 1>where poverty is enforced,</v>

374
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>where ignorance prevails ends,</v>

375
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 1>where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to</v>

376
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 1>oppress rob and degrade them.</v>

377
