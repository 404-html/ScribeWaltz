1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Just before we jump into the video today,</v>

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I do want to say that this guy is a gentleman,</v>

3
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>his name is John Hub and I hope I'm pronouncing that right Germans,</v>

4
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but I do want to say for all of the viewers today,</v>

5
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably going to screw that up at some point.</v>

6
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably just going to go with calling him John,</v>

7
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>because it's easier for me to pronounce rather than trying with the whole thing</v>

9
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:18.714
<v Speaker 1>for the whole video.</v>

10
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's that out of the way.</v>

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.193
<v Speaker 1>Let's get into it.</v>

12
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>What would you think of a man who supported the greatest mass murder machine in</v>

13
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>human history?</v>

14
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>A man who was proud to stands by a genocidal dictator who nearly destroyed</v>

15
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

16
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>a man proud to call himself a Nazi.</v>

17
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>What do you find him sickening or evil?</v>

18
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

20
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>If he was John Rob high ranking Nazi.</v>

21
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Rob was an ardent supporter of adult Hitler,</v>

22
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>but he was also something else.</v>

23
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>He was perhaps the greatest humanitarian that you've never heard of,</v>

24
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>known as the Good Nazi of Nan.</v>

25
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>King Rab was the third reichs man in China when the capital felons and Japan's</v>

26
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>German aligned forces faced with the imperial armies genocidal actions.</v>

27
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>He did something wholly unexpected.</v>

28
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>He tried to save the lives of every Chinese civilian in the city.</v>

29
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Over six incredible weeks,</v>

30
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>John Rob stood at the epicenter of a bloodbath,</v>

31
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>single handedly protecting nine kings residents from a well winds of rape and</v>

32
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

33
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>He is today credited with saving 250,000 lives and deeded all of this while</v>

34
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>still staying loyal to adult Hitler.</v>

35
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Today we delve into the fascinating story of history's good Nazi.</v>

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>When Joan Rob was born in Hamburg on November the 23rd 18,</v>

37
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>82.</v>

38
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It was into a world that was on the cusp of a dramatic change just a year before</v>

39
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Speaker 1>the rising state of Germany had delivered a surprise knockout blow to France in</v>

40
00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 1>the Franco Prussian war for rob's contemporaries.</v>

41
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That men's growing up at a time of unbridled optimism,</v>

42
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.700
<v Speaker 1>not that rubbed salt marsh have it taken out of school as a young age when his</v>

43
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>ship captain and father suddenly died and stuck into an unhappy apprenticeship.</v>

44
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Young John was a boy,</v>

45
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>always hoping to escape Germany and see the world,</v>

46
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>and so he did in 19.</v>

47
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:18.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

48
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:18.611
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

49
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>The 21 year old rob set out for the Portuguese African colony of Lutheran qualm</v>

50
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.811
<v Speaker 1>mark now,</v>

51
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and the pewter in Mozambique,</v>

52
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>it seems he planned to stay there long term,</v>

53
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but an outbreak of malaria forced him to resend it to Hamburg after just three</v>

54
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>years for John.</v>

55
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>This was a blessing in disguise back in Hamburg.</v>

56
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>He met up with an old school crush named Dora and was delighted to discover that</v>

57
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>she was into him to the two quarter.</v>

58
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>They fell in love and became these sickening German version of those loved other</v>

59
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>couples who can't spend a single second to pause if John has been a slightly</v>

60
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>more average man,</v>

61
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>well that would've been it,</v>

62
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>but John,</v>

63
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't San Fridge despite looking like a Nan cast by a which to forever</v>

64
00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>resemble a certified accountant.</v>

65
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>John Rob had an adventurous soul three years in Africa.</v>

66
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It simply hasn't been enough for him.</v>

67
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>So in Nineteen Oh eight,</v>

68
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he presented Dora with a plan.</v>

69
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>The two of them would move to Shanghai rather than ask if a new lover Gone Mad.</v>

70
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Dora replied with the early 20th century dramatic equivalence of how yes,</v>

71
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>neither of them could have known they'd chosen to move to a kingdom on the verge</v>

72
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>of catastrophe.</v>

73
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>On November the 15th,</v>

74
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>1,980 to the dowager,</v>

75
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>empress 60 breathed her last in the imperio gardens of Beijing.</v>

76
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>The power behind the throne in China since 18,</v>

77
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.841
<v Speaker 1>65,</v>

78
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.841
<v Speaker 1>her passing left the ching dynasty dangerously unstabled already left reeling by</v>

79
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the recent boxer rebellion.</v>

80
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>The family that had ruled China over 250 years at that last,</v>

81
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>it's matriarch.</v>

82
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

83
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>was replaced on the threatened by her two year old pui and spoiled her and I</v>

84
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.101
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

85
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:56.101
<v Speaker 1>don't bother memorizing that name as the aftershocks of sixties death rumbled</v>

86
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>through Chinese society,</v>

87
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.560
<v Speaker 1>John Andorra,</v>

88
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>they were entering a new era of their own in 19 Oh,</v>

89
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:02.321
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

90
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>The young couple married in 1910.</v>

91
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>John got a position as a clerk in a Siemens office in Beijing.</v>

92
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It was a position that will allow them to rise up quickly through the ranks,</v>

93
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>becoming a pillar of the German ex pat community.</v>

94
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It was also a position that would give him a front row seat as China exploded.</v>

95
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an old Chinese curse that goes,</v>

96
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>may you live in interesting times.</v>

97
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Well Times in China.</v>

98
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>They were certainly about to get interesting.</v>

99
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 1>On October the 10th,</v>

100
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.781
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>

101
00:04:35.781 --> 00:04:36.110
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

102
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the city of Wu Chang exploded in rebellion against the emperor boy.</v>

103
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 1>This lit the fuse on roughly a bazillion of a powder kegs,</v>

104
00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:46.340
<v Speaker 1>and in no time at all,</v>

105
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.780
<v Speaker 1>half of China was in revolt known as the zing high revolution.</v>

106
00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:55.781
<v Speaker 1>It ended when six year old boy you abdicated in January of 1912 ending the Ching</v>

107
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Dynasty for a revolution that closed the door on 2000 years of imperial rule,</v>

108
00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the sing high revolution.</v>

109
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>It went remarkably smoothly.</v>

110
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.450
<v Speaker 1>China was declared a republic and you on Chicago became its head like most other</v>

111
00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 1>German ex pats.</v>

112
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.711
<v Speaker 1>Gentleman,</v>

113
00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:10.544
<v Speaker 1>Dora Rave,</v>

114
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>almost totally unaffected by these southern changeover of power.</v>

115
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.601
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

116
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.810
<v Speaker 1>the same cannot be said for the next problem that was going to afflict China and</v>

117
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 1>out of course was world war one.</v>

118
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:21.561
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

120
00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:25.430
<v Speaker 1>we probably need to backtrack a little for a quick historical explainer.</v>

121
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.730
<v Speaker 1>For about 300 years before their abs had arrived,</v>

122
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 1>China had been the most powerful nation in the east.</v>

123
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Then in 18,</v>

124
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 1>53,</v>

125
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>a guy called Commodore Perry led a fleet of ships into Edo Bay just outside of</v>

126
00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo and threatens to blast the city into rubble and less Japan opened up its</v>

127
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.030
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

128
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.510
<v Speaker 1>The result was the opening of Japan under the Meiji government,</v>

129
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>good news for American trade.</v>

130
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Very bad news for China.</v>

131
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.400
<v Speaker 1>This new Japan.</v>

132
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It quickly became a regional powerhouse as China lumbered along and also find</v>

133
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Japan started throwing its weight around like a sumo wrestler,</v>

134
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>receiving electroshock therapy in 18,</v>

135
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.061
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>

136
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Japan even warped Beijing and the first sign of Japanese war.</v>

137
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>This was an epic humiliation for trainer and it got even more epic when Germany</v>

138
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>took advantage of China's weakness to occupy Qingdao in 18,</v>

139
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>97,</v>

140
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>setting up the German Shendong when World War One to finally rolled around.</v>

141
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>China was eager to reclaim the stolen territory.</v>

142
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

143
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo,</v>

144
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>they weren't done humiliating them just yet.</v>

145
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.981
<v Speaker 1>And late 19,</v>

146
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

147
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Japan in Britain joined forces to invade chandon kicking for Germans out.</v>

148
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>One of Tokyo's conditions for joining the fight was the China wouldn't be</v>

149
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 1>allowed to get involved.</v>

150
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>The allies agreed with China castrated as effectively as a unit.</v>

151
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Japan gobbled up a small territory taking south Manchuria.</v>

152
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.280
<v Speaker 1>In the war's aftermath,</v>

153
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>the allies pressed China to officially seed Shendong and south Manchuria to</v>

154
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

155
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Japan was further empowered and China was further humiliated perhaps in</v>

156
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:00.900
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

157
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>

158
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.721
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

159
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 1>sore trying to kick out.</v>

160
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's German expats including John and Dora.</v>

161
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Rob,</v>

162
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>despite having lived in China for more than a decade,</v>

163
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>suddenly they were personas non grata the death of president you on Chicago back</v>

164
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>in 1916 had by 1919,</v>

165
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>triggered a collapse of Chinese society known as the warlord era with China</v>

166
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Balkanizing into competing states constantly at war with one another.</v>

167
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>The city is desperately needed.</v>

168
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Foreign expertise to stop themselves from including before 19,</v>

169
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>19 was even out.</v>

170
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>John Andorra.</v>

171
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Rob had been but grudgingly invited back in</v>

172
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.683
<v Speaker 1>the warlord era.</v>

173
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>It came to a close in 1928 when nationalist troops led by Chiang Kai Shek</v>

174
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>succeeded in reunifying China by force.</v>

175
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>They established a new capital and non king beginning something called the</v>

176
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] decade.</v>

177
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>It was a time of prosperity that China had not seen since before World War One,</v>

178
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the economy,</v>

179
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it boomed,</v>

180
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>

181
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 1>rains,</v>

182
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.550
<v Speaker 1>and people's lives improved.</v>

183
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Among them was John Rob throughout the warlord era.</v>

184
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:08.990
<v Speaker 1>This quiet gentleman,</v>

185
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.400
<v Speaker 1>businessmen hood plugged away with typical central European efficiency rising</v>

186
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>through the ranks of Siemens Asian division,</v>

187
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>even as China crumbled all around him in the boom times of the Nanking Decade,</v>

188
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Siemens Made Rob Managing Director.</v>

189
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>If it's Chinese division,</v>

190
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a license.</v>

191
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>John Andorra,</v>

192
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 1>they moved to nanking in 1931,</v>

193
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but 1931 was also the year that the wheels started to come off the new era.</v>

194
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>On September the 18th,</v>

195
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Japanese forces used the pretext of a terrorist attack in south Manchuria to</v>

196
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 1>invade Manchuria proper,</v>

197
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>setting up a pro Japanese puppet state under our old friends and per a per year.</v>

198
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Rather than fight this new aggression,</v>

199
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese did something that probably seemed smart at the time,</v>

200
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but in retrospect does look a bit stupid.</v>

201
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>They took their case to the League of nations set up in the wake of World War</v>

202
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.171
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

203
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>The League of nations was meant to settle disputes between nations without the</v>

204
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 1>need for war.</v>

205
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.740
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

206
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.400
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

207
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty weakened toothless.</v>

208
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 1>When it concluded the Japanese had been wronged to invade Manchuria.</v>

209
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>The Tokyo delegation stormed off rather than cool tensions.</v>

210
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>The League had actually raised them the things they wouldn't explode just yet.</v>

211
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.451
<v Speaker 1>Back in then,</v>

212
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:19.171
<v Speaker 1>King John,</v>

213
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>rob was becoming the most important westerner in all of China.</v>

214
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>In 1934,</v>

215
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>he opens a German school on his property and made himself the chairman.</v>

216
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>This brought you into contact for the first time with the Nazi party.</v>

217
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

218
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

219
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 1>of Hitler had become Germany's unchallenged dick data,</v>

220
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

221
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>the emphasis on the first syllable there was fully intentional in this doc,</v>

222
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 1>new world being a public German to figure being a Nazi even if you lived in</v>

223
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.224
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

224
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but this wasn't a problem for rob already loved Nazi-ism.</v>

225
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Historians struggled to reconcile the humanitarian.</v>

226
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>John Rob with the fascist drawn rob,</v>

227
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 1>although he joined the party late in 1934,</v>

228
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 1>rob quickly became one of Hitler's biggest cheerleaders.</v>

229
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>He wrote of the regime,</v>

230
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I believe not only in the correctness of our political system,</v>

231
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but as an organizer of the party.</v>

232
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I am behind the system 100 percent.</v>

233
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

234
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 1>this is a man who had many Chinese friends who consider China his home,</v>

235
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.790
<v Speaker 1>and Harry was throwing his support behind a system that considered the Chinese</v>

236
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 1>inferior.</v>

237
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 1>The best gas historians have is that Ray does an ex pat 5,000 miles away from</v>

238
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

239
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 1>was unaware of national socialisms racism.</v>

240
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

241
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>he was enthused by the socialism part with its emphasis on protecting the</v>

242
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 1>dignity of the working man.</v>

243
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the truth relevant soon rose up the ranks of the party and became the</v>

244
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 1>leading Nazi and Nan King.</v>

245
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 1>It was arise that would come inside with one of the worst atrocities in modern</v>

246
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:47.694
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

247
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 1>On July the seventh,</v>

248
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:54.831
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

249
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:55.401
<v Speaker 1>37,</v>

250
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:57.020
<v Speaker 1>a skirmish broke out on the market,</v>

251
00:10:57.021 --> 00:10:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Podo bridge between Chinese and Japanese forces.</v>

252
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It was just one of many such clashes that happens following the occupation of</v>

253
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:04.881
<v Speaker 1>Manchuria,</v>

254
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:07.190
<v Speaker 1>but this time something went wrong.</v>

255
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.600
<v Speaker 1>The kind of progressed into a battle and the battle progressed and do a Japanese</v>

256
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.220
<v Speaker 1>invasion and the invasion of that progressed into a wall.</v>

257
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

258
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.890
<v Speaker 1>The second sign,</v>

259
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.411
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>

260
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:23.180
<v Speaker 1>will it adjust begun and it would make the first one look like a bit of a stroll</v>

261
00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:24.014
<v Speaker 1>in the park,</v>

262
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.340
<v Speaker 1>right from the off.</v>

263
00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:27.830
<v Speaker 1>The imperial army steamrolled across China.</v>

264
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.030
<v Speaker 1>In no time at all.</v>

265
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.780
<v Speaker 1>They were converging upon nanking as Balm,</v>

266
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:32.390
<v Speaker 1>as rains,</v>

267
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.040
<v Speaker 1>fiery death down on the city.</v>

268
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:35.180
<v Speaker 1>All of those with money,</v>

269
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.940
<v Speaker 1>they flat among them were John and rob,</v>

270
00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:41.540
<v Speaker 1>who joined a tight of western is streaming away for the relative safety of</v>

271
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:42.980
<v Speaker 1>places like p Tire,</v>

272
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.510
<v Speaker 1>but Joel and Dora,</v>

273
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 1>they were never ones to lay low and avoid danger on September the 20.</v>

274
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.920
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

275
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.070
<v Speaker 1>they pretend to nat king as John would later write in his diary.</v>

276
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just to protect his property because he felt he had a duty to his</v>

277
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Chinese employees and his where we get to the really difficult part.</v>

278
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Rob Didn't return to help nanking in spite of being a Nazi.</v>

279
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>He did it because he was a Nazi,</v>

280
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>as hard as it might be for us to stomach.</v>

281
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It was the ideology of Nazi-ism that made rob feel that he had to stay</v>

282
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 1>protecting his Chinese workers as the fearer was protecting Germany's working</v>

283
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>men by October,</v>

284
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 1>barely at 20 westerners remained in the city.</v>

285
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>As the Imperial Army closed in,</v>

286
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:29.000
<v Speaker 1>rob cooled the other experts to his house and 14 responded among them.</v>

287
00:12:29.001 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>The American doctor Robert Wilson.</v>

288
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 1>We have to do something.</v>

289
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Rob told them that something was the Nanking Safety Zone.</v>

290
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Rob's plan with symbol,</v>

291
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.110
<v Speaker 1>despite being completely on arms.</v>

292
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>The 14 westerners would unilaterally established a two and a half square mile</v>

293
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>zone of neutrality in Nanking,</v>

294
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.040
<v Speaker 1>centered on Rob's house and the German school surrounded by white flags.</v>

295
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>It would protect as many Chinese civilians is necessary.</v>

296
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>When word got on to the advancing imperial army at dispatched to major archives.</v>

297
00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You try and talk to this crazy German out of staying.</v>

298
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 1>As rob later recalled,</v>

299
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Daca came to him in person and asked,</v>

300
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>why in the devil did you stay?</v>

301
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to involve yourself in our military affairs?</v>

302
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>What does all of this matter to you?</v>

303
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.720
<v Speaker 1>You haven't lost anything here.</v>

304
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Looking at the major in the eye,</v>

305
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 1>John Rob replied,</v>

306
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I've been living here in China for over 30 years.</v>

307
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.570
<v Speaker 1>My kids and grandchildren were born here and I'm happy.</v>

308
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm successful here.</v>

309
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>If I had spent 30 years in Japan and were treated just as well by the Japanese</v>

310
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

311
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you can be assured that in a time of emergency sop chances,</v>

312
00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>the situation China faces now,</v>

313
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I would not leave the site of the people in Japan.</v>

314
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>The loyalty and rub statement,</v>

315
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to touch something in the major soul,</v>

316
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 1>agreed rob could stay in the zone and there's no harm would come to him.</v>

317
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

318
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:52.360
<v Speaker 1>he said nothing about what would happen to any Chinese men that rob tried to</v>

319
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.700
<v Speaker 1>shelter is full,</v>

320
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.780
<v Speaker 1>gave way to a bidder,</v>

321
00:13:54.781 --> 00:13:59.380
<v Speaker 1>wins a rob Wilson and others plastered nanking and posters telling citizens</v>

322
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.660
<v Speaker 1>about the zone Raul,</v>

323
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 1>but even personally sent a telegram to and asking him to request the Japanese</v>

324
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged the zone as neutrality.</v>

325
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.560
<v Speaker 1>You can probably guess how that one went during the last few days before nanking</v>

326
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>fell rather dramatically draped buildings in the zone with vast Nazi flags</v>

327
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>hoping to determine our Japanese moments.</v>

328
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>He had swastikas painted on walls,</v>

329
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 1>deck his car out and party Regalia,</v>

330
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.740
<v Speaker 1>and took to wearing his uniform in public at the last moments and hangings may</v>

331
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>or officially handed power over to rob and fled the city.</v>

332
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.391
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

333
00:14:29.391 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 1>all robin,</v>

334
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>the rest of his ex pats could do was wait on December the 11th,</v>

335
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>heavy shelling.</v>

336
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It started as the bombardment increased.</v>

337
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.970
<v Speaker 1>The last Chinese in the capital flooded into the zone,</v>

338
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of a million people a converged on rob's property,</v>

339
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:44.980
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in ditches,</v>

340
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:46.570
<v Speaker 1>cramming themselves into tents,</v>

341
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 1>climbing across one another just to be less than it was a wave of human</v>

342
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.124
<v Speaker 1>desperation,</v>

343
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 1>unlike anything the westerners I'd ever seen.</v>

344
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.153
<v Speaker 1>Two nights later,</v>

345
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>rob stood at a window with Dora watching the columns of flames to the south and</v>

346
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 1>his garden below,</v>

347
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>a crawling massive humanity wailed and screamed and begged for their lives as</v>

348
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the screaming and the shedding grew louder.</v>

349
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Rob finally snaps doning the metal helmet.</v>

350
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>He's straight into the garden and screamed at the refugees to shut off.</v>

351
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 1>He said that it was all going to be fine.</v>

352
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.180
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese would treat them fairly.</v>

353
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 1>He was absolutely sure of it,</v>

354
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.971
<v Speaker 1>but his words,</v>

355
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:22.200
<v Speaker 1>they were lost in the din of the gunfire.</v>

356
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.300
<v Speaker 1>If they had carried,</v>

357
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>it's unlikely anyone would have heated them.</v>

358
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 1>It was December the 13th,</v>

359
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:27.501
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

360
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 1>37 and apocalypse.</v>

361
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:30.403
<v Speaker 1>It was in the APP.</v>

362
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>As the flames roared,</v>

363
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:31.971
<v Speaker 1>Har,</v>

364
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>the refugees huddle type together,</v>

365
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens next,</v>

366
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>they knew that it would not be fine.</v>

367
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.650
<v Speaker 1>On the morning of December,</v>

368
00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:48.280
<v Speaker 1>the 14th drawn rub awoke to a city blanketed in eerie,</v>

369
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:48.850
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>

370
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:49.661
<v Speaker 1>daunting as uniform.</v>

371
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:51.280
<v Speaker 1>He ventured out into the cold,</v>

372
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:52.810
<v Speaker 1>empty streets beyond the zone,</v>

373
00:15:52.811 --> 00:15:56.950
<v Speaker 1>wondering what he would find out that the roads of Nanking when littered with</v>

374
00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:57.431
<v Speaker 1>corpses,</v>

375
00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:00.130
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of civilians lay lifeless in the streets,</v>

376
00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:05.131
<v Speaker 1>shot in the back as they flat bodies of women had been mutilated their vaginas</v>

377
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.140
<v Speaker 1>penetrated by Ben Blades.</v>

378
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.280
<v Speaker 1>On a street corner,</v>

379
00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:13.390
<v Speaker 1>rob found a small contingent of Japanese troops losing a German cafe.</v>

380
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.710
<v Speaker 1>When he tried to stop them,</v>

381
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.810
<v Speaker 1>they laughed.</v>

382
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Well though they didn't harm rob,</v>

383
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.150
<v Speaker 1>they burned the cafe down.</v>

384
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Amused buys impotence as he returned from this unsettling expedition Rob Pasta,</v>

385
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.510
<v Speaker 1>but dragos bunch of 400 Chinese army regulars trying to retreat.</v>

386
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>They were exhausted,</v>

387
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 1>stumbling cutoff from safety.</v>

388
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.200
<v Speaker 1>The sight of them was so pitiful that rob told the soldiers that they could take</v>

389
00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:38.410
<v Speaker 1>refuge in the zone on the one condition that they disarmed.</v>

390
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.970
<v Speaker 1>You still felt set in the imperial army would respect the zones neutrality.</v>

391
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 1>That's an eit.</v>

392
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:44.301
<v Speaker 1>Diplomat,</v>

393
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Katsuaki Ozaki cooled on rob,</v>

394
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:48.610
<v Speaker 1>who was still acting as the mayor of the city.</v>

395
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>He informed the gentleman that received intelligence,</v>

396
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:53.170
<v Speaker 1>that soldiers were in the zone.</v>

397
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.270
<v Speaker 1>He told rob that have to be arrested,</v>

398
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:57.730
<v Speaker 1>but he assured him that no harm would come to them,</v>

399
00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.320
<v Speaker 1>unable to do anything else.</v>

400
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Rob agreed over the next few days,</v>

401
00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Japanese fight as much through the zone looking for Chinese soldiers.</v>

402
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>That method for detection was to look for calluses on my hands from firing</v>

403
00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:10.120
<v Speaker 1>rifles to rob's Hora.</v>

404
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of young men were dragged from the zone.</v>

405
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.150
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of them rickshaw drivers and workers who had been wrongly</v>

406
00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:16.984
<v Speaker 1>identified.</v>

407
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.840
<v Speaker 1>They went lines up just outside and machine guns.</v>

408
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.180
<v Speaker 1>That bodies being dumped into ponds.</v>

409
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.380
<v Speaker 1>It was Joan Rob's first encounter with the brutality of the imperial army,</v>

410
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and it would not be his last as the tends December days,</v>

411
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:34.170
<v Speaker 1>past dream as began to drift into the zone of atrocities being committed outside</v>

412
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.990
<v Speaker 1>of it that were reports of Japanese soldiers going from house to house looking</v>

413
00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:39.850
<v Speaker 1>for women's or rape age.</v>

414
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.840
<v Speaker 1>It was an austin issue.</v>

415
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.370
<v Speaker 1>There were reports of abuse.</v>

416
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Girls who were so young that the soldiers,</v>

417
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.530
<v Speaker 1>they type in their genitals so that they could fit in sight.</v>

418
00:17:47.531 --> 00:17:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Them.</v>

419
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Boys were forced at gunpoint to rape their own mothers.</v>

420
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Men Right there,</v>

421
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.231
<v Speaker 1>I daughters,</v>

422
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>women who'd been abused,</v>

423
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 1>sexually tortured to death.</v>

424
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>That genitals mutilated in the zone.</v>

425
00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 1>John Rob,</v>

426
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>listen to these reports with a mounting Hora again and again.</v>

427
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>He petitioned the Japanese offices who did nothing.</v>

428
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 1>He Telegrams Gemini and demanded help,</v>

429
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 1>but nothing came just before Christmas of 1937 something,</v>

430
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 1>and then it seems to have snapped cuffs off from the rest of the wells in a city</v>

431
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>that had gone mad.</v>

432
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Rob came to an inescapable conclusion.</v>

433
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>If he wanted these atrocities to stop,</v>

434
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.830
<v Speaker 1>he would have to do something to stop them himself.</v>

435
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And this begins the inspiring chapter of John Rob's life.</v>

436
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 1>The moments when he did something so mad,</v>

437
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 1>so courageous,</v>

438
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>he can only be called a hero with nanking burning around him.</v>

439
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Rob Dressed in his Nazi regalia,</v>

440
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>left the relative safety of the zone,</v>

441
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>completely unarmed.</v>

442
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He set out to save the city's residence.</v>

443
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 1>This was nothing short of insanity.</v>

444
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Rob might have been protected by the imperial armies offices,</v>

445
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but it was very loose protection out on the streets.</v>

446
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 1>He was just a man and a man without a gun who was staring down the bayonets of</v>

447
00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Japanese soldiers,</v>

448
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>and yet that is walked.</v>

449
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:05.000
<v Speaker 1>He did day off today as the southern crawled up into the winter sky,</v>

450
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>rob would leave the zone listening to cries of help.</v>

451
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 1>The telltale screams he would follow these streaks until he founds the marauding</v>

452
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:14.250
<v Speaker 1>soldiers storm right up to them,</v>

453
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 1>shove his swastika armband in their faces and give them a brutal dressing down.</v>

454
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.673
<v Speaker 1>Amazingly,</v>

455
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.040
<v Speaker 1>it worked terrified by this German barking orders at them.</v>

456
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:24.450
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers they fled.</v>

457
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Rob would then take the girl that had been abusing out to his car and instruct</v>

458
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the driver to take her to the zone.</v>

459
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Then it's simply carry on walking,</v>

460
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.810
<v Speaker 1>looking for the next woman in trouble,</v>

461
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.210
<v Speaker 1>and then the next and the next.</v>

462
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Now it's really impossible to overstate just how crazy this was.</v>

463
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Rob could have been killed hundreds of times.</v>

464
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

465
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 1>There was something that bounces authority,</v>

466
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>something about the way he wielded as Nazi policy membership that put the fear</v>

467
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 1>of God into the Imperial Army.</v>

468
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Elsewhere.</v>

469
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 1>The Nazi swastika became a symbol of hate and rob's hands.</v>

470
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>It became a symbol of hope.</v>

471
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Yet rob was not just some silent angel passing through the hell of Nanking.</v>

472
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.930
<v Speaker 1>He was a man capable of understanding the need for warmth for humanity.</v>

473
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 1>He endora organized a birthday parties for children in the zone,</v>

474
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.190
<v Speaker 1>singing songs.</v>

475
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:13.980
<v Speaker 1>His death and demons clawed at the doors,</v>

476
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.970
<v Speaker 1>unsurprisingly,</v>

477
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.190
<v Speaker 1>most of the boys bone in the zone that winter.</v>

478
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.040
<v Speaker 1>They were named John Roberts.</v>

479
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:20.900
<v Speaker 1>He managed to win over his fellow western.</v>

480
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Dr Wilson was a staunch Anti Nazi.</v>

481
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 1>You considered anyone who joined the party evil.</v>

482
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Yet even he grew to respect this one Nazi.</v>

483
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Even if he could never understand how rob could be so good while supporting</v>

484
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:34.440
<v Speaker 1>something that was so evil.</v>

485
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Six weeks off to the zones,</v>

486
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:37.290
<v Speaker 1>first refugees arrived,</v>

487
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.160
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

488
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.090
<v Speaker 1>it finally came in the dying.</v>

489
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not cold days of January.</v>

490
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 1>The imperial armies.</v>

491
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Hi Andrea,</v>

492
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>so had control over their forces in Nan king.</v>

493
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 1>They marched into the zone and remove the refugees.</v>

494
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.031
<v Speaker 1>I collaborate to.</v>

495
00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Government was set up as the rapes with stops.</v>

496
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.640
<v Speaker 1>In a cruel irony,</v>

497
00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:58.840
<v Speaker 1>the imperial army triumphantly proclaims that that restored order to the city</v>

498
00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.501
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

499
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 1>It's estimated that a minimum of 20,000 women were raped during the full of</v>

500
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:04.690
<v Speaker 1>nanking.</v>

501
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 1>The widely accepted death dull.</v>

502
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.400
<v Speaker 1>It ranges from 100,000 to 300,000 prisoners of war were decapitated with swords.</v>

503
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>They were blown up with land mines.</v>

504
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 1>They were doused in petrol and set on fire in Japan.</v>

505
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Many still deny that the rape of nanking,</v>

506
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 1>if it happens less than a month off to the zone,</v>

507
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:24.424
<v Speaker 1>was dismantled.</v>

508
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Rob Got a call from Siemens ordering him and him to Germany packing as many</v>

509
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 1>films and photos of the massacre as he could.</v>

510
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>He promised Wilson it spread word of the rape of Nanking back in Europe.</v>

511
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Then he boarded a plane with Dora and he left.</v>

512
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Now is it for John?</v>

513
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Rob,</v>

514
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.120
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he touched down in Germany,</v>

515
00:21:48.121 --> 00:21:50.550
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested by the Gestapo for annoying.</v>

516
00:21:50.551 --> 00:21:51.600
<v Speaker 1>They're Japanese allies.</v>

517
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It was in prison and it was only the intervention of Siemens CEO that saved him</v>

518
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.050
<v Speaker 1>reassigned to a lonely character position.</v>

519
00:21:58.051 --> 00:22:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Rob Spent the next few years struggling just to make ends meet.</v>

520
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>When World War Two ended in mid 1945,</v>

521
00:22:03.631 --> 00:22:05.460
<v Speaker 1>his former standing within the Nazi party.</v>

522
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:05.731
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

523
00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:06.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm arrested again.</v>

524
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.030
<v Speaker 1>This time by the allies put on trial.</v>

525
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Rob was only saved this time around by testimony from Dr Wilson left to rot in</v>

526
00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:14.370
<v Speaker 1>jail for a year.</v>

527
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Rob was finally declared dean ossified in 1946 and he was released with a stain</v>

528
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.360
<v Speaker 1>of Nazi membership clinging to his soul.</v>

529
00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:25.530
<v Speaker 1>The last years of John Rob's life saw him become unemployable as the post war</v>

530
00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 1>German economic miracle or living standards rise in the defeated nation,</v>

531
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.550
<v Speaker 1>John and slash or rob sank into help this poverty.</v>

532
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.000
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that kept them going and those harsh years were sent me regular</v>

533
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>food parcels covered in Chinese writing that resound address.</v>

534
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It was always nagging.</v>

535
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.091
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

536
00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:43.260
<v Speaker 1>in January of Nineteen 50,</v>

537
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:43.561
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

538
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:45.720
<v Speaker 1>rob keeled over and died of a stroke.</v>

539
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.330
<v Speaker 1>It was 68 by the time he died.</v>

540
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.811
<v Speaker 1>Rob Was A.</v>

541
00:22:48.811 --> 00:22:52.650
<v Speaker 1>nobody a source of shame that came in Germany had been written out of the</v>

542
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Chinese history of hanging by the Julian stored communist party.</v>

543
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Those who'd been in Nanking,</v>

544
00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:58.643
<v Speaker 1>they remembered him,</v>

545
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.920
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of the world they forgot</v>

546
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 nineties,</v>

547
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Iris Chang was researching the Nanjing Massacre.</v>

548
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.030
<v Speaker 1>She uncovered rob's diaries alongside stacks of documents relating to his</v>

549
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:17.390
<v Speaker 1>involvement in the safety side.</v>

550
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Piecing is incredible story together she managed to return his name to the wells</v>

551
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:23.170
<v Speaker 1>at large,</v>

552
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>not long after the Chinese government paid to have rob's gravestone taken from</v>

553
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Berlin and reentered in Nanjing,</v>

554
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the modern city that John and Dora had known as king.</v>

555
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It was placed at the site of a gigantic memorial to the massacre.</v>

556
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 1>After half a century,</v>

557
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 1>rob had finally then returns to the country which had fought for and Ted loved</v>

558
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:44.344
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

559
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.891
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>

560
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that rob's actions in nanking saved somewhere in the region of</v>

561
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:51.440
<v Speaker 1>250,000 lives.</v>

562
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Nearly everyone who made it into the zone.</v>

563
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.891
<v Speaker 1>By contrast,</v>

564
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 1>the far more famous Oscar Schindler saved 1,200 people.</v>

565
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt that schindler was a hero,</v>

566
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.933
<v Speaker 1>but rob,</v>

567
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 1>he was something more.</v>

568
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He was a savior as history is good.</v>

569
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Nazi once wrote,</v>

570
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 1>if you can do some good,</v>

571
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.463
