00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Just before you started with this one,</v>

2
00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I do want to say that there's going to be some French pronunciations,</v>

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.720
<v Speaker 1>not a French speaker.</v>

4
00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I am doing my best though.</v>

5
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>George Washington Simon Boulevard even punch through via the names of the Great</v>

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>North and South American revolutionaries.</v>

7
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Remain globally famous centuries on this one.</v>

8
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Great new wells,</v>

9
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.620
<v Speaker 1>redell many of forgotten he was a nobody.</v>

10
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>He became a somebody only after 50 years of obscurity,</v>

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>a freed slave who wound up leading the only successful large scale slave revolt</v>

12
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>in history.</v>

13
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>The general who made Haiti the second free colony in the whole of the Americas.</v>

14
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>His name was too,</v>

15
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>so the river tour,</v>

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Aka the Black Napoleon born into slavery over to his early life,</v>

17
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>was an inspiring tale of overcoming a racist system to live a free man,</v>

18
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>but it was his later years that were truly remarkable as he kept on rising until</v>

19
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>he became ruler of the society that had enslaved them and enlightened thinker,</v>

20
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>a prescient philosopher and a brilliant general that over to you.</v>

21
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I was also a man who dared to dream of freedom even if he wouldn't live.</v>

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>To see those dreams fulfilled,</v>

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>this is the story of the greatest black revolutionary who ever lived</v>

24
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>imagined.</v>

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>History is a vast cave,</v>

26
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>swelling with shadows,</v>

27
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>and each person's life is a distant torch.</v>

28
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Some of those lives like Napoleon's,</v>

29
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic pyres burning so brightly that you can't possibly miss them,</v>

30
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.923
<v Speaker 1>but others,</v>

31
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>most of them a little more than matchsticks,</v>

32
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>almost invisible.</v>

33
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It's into this category,</v>

34
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 1>the early life of two song that ever true or false,</v>

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>remarkably for a man who would go on to liberate an entire nation,</v>

36
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>we know almost nothing about him.</v>

37
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>We can say for certain that he was born in the French colony of Sandman,</v>

38
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>now known as Haiti and 1741 just slave parents.</v>

39
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>We can also say that his original name was to som Breda off to his plantation,</v>

40
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>but beyond that,</v>

41
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
<v Speaker 1>everything is a myth and shadow the life of a slave and sandy was not pretty.</v>

42
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the population lived in shackles while a few tens of thousands</v>

43
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.030
<v Speaker 1>of whites and fried collards,</v>

44
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 1>as they were known existed in a state of luxury.</v>

45
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>The average slave life expectancy was only 21 years.</v>

46
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Those who downs tools fought back or ran away,</v>

47
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:37.331
<v Speaker 1>could expect to be blinded or mutilators yes to Seoul was lucky.</v>

48
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>One of the consistent themes of the conflicting accounts of his early years is</v>

49
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>that he was born onto the plantation of a relatively enlightened master.</v>

50
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>The wound you saw taught him French,</v>

51
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>allowed him to gain some medical knowledge and promoted him to a job as a horse</v>

52
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>trainer in 1776.</v>

53
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>He even granted to song is freedom.</v>

54
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>It's at this point to solemn briefly resends to the historical.</v>

55
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>He married and had two kids and it's remarkably.</v>

56
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>He even though disliked the own after this 15 more years passed in which to saw</v>

57
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

58
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.050
<v Speaker 1>not even the slightest footprint on history by the time 1791 rolled around,</v>

59
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:18.181
<v Speaker 1>he was 50 and age at which most normal biographies are starting to wind down by</v>

60
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>

61
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon had already conquered half of Europe,</v>

62
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>been defeated at Waterloo,</v>

63
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>and then send him to exile by comparison to Sony was a small time farmer,</v>

64
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.240
<v Speaker 1>may ember in that dark cave of history that's on a diesel,</v>

65
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>had every reason to believe he was going to die and nothing but obscurity.</v>

66
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully for our story though,</v>

67
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>winds of change were starting to blow in Europe in no time at all to song and</v>

68
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>everyone in Santa Monica would be consumed by the oncoming hurricane.</v>

69
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.530
<v Speaker 1>In 1799,</v>

70
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.181
<v Speaker 1>a group of friends,</v>

71
00:03:55.181 --> 00:04:00.181
<v Speaker 1>radicals unknowingly lit the fuse on a gigantic pile of dynamite marked the</v>

72
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>French revolution.</v>

73
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>The ensuing explosion would shake up human history.</v>

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.631
<v Speaker 1>In most cases,</v>

75
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the effects will be felt until a few years down the line,</v>

76
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>but Sandman wasn't most cases.</v>

77
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:17.031
<v Speaker 1>It was a radical tinderbox barely kept in check by far away Paris almost as soon</v>

78
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>as the French Revolution spock's the entire country went up in flames.</v>

79
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.800
<v Speaker 1>By mid 17,</v>

80
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>

81
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.550
<v Speaker 1>everyone was aware of the storming of the Bastille and the declaration of the</v>

82
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 1>rights of man.</v>

83
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>This was a problem because the declaration was pretty clear that the rights of</v>

84
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:34.651
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

85
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:35.730
<v Speaker 1>what universal,</v>

86
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:36.780
<v Speaker 1>which in Santa Mom,</v>

87
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>they pretty clearly we're not the wide stumped on the colors.</v>

88
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.100
<v Speaker 1>He dumped on the freed blacks.</v>

89
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>He dumped on the slaves with the whole system,</v>

90
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>designed as a pyramids of exploitation.</v>

91
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 1>If everyone was suddenly equal,</v>

92
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:51.170
<v Speaker 1>sound among would cease to exist for whites.</v>

93
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>The French revolution represented both a threat and the chance to speak less</v>

94
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>often declare a white supremacist republic for the college.</v>

95
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>It represented a chance to finally knock the winds down,</v>

96
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:03.240
<v Speaker 1>a peg or two that year.</v>

97
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>The two sides were almost openly potting revolts.</v>

98
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.171
<v Speaker 1>In doing so,</v>

99
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>they failed to realize that a much larger group had seen in the revolution and</v>

100
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>even bigger chance than they did out on the plantations and in the darkness of</v>

101
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:16.321
<v Speaker 1>the forests,</v>

102
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 1>black slaves had began whispering to one another by the summer.</v>

103
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.560
<v Speaker 1>The whispers that turned into an idea,</v>

104
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.750
<v Speaker 1>which in turn became a plan.</v>

105
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

106
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>on the night of August,</v>

107
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:27.031
<v Speaker 1>the 14th,</v>

108
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:27.481
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

109
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:27.931
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>

110
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:32.931
<v Speaker 1>a group of slaves met outside the capital of lcap performed a secret voodoo</v>

111
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 1>ceremony that are under the stars.</v>

112
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:38.070
<v Speaker 1>They swore by blood to do the unthinkable.</v>

113
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to results if the French revolution started small before snowballing</v>

114
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>into an unstoppable avalanche,</v>

115
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the Haitian Revolution went straight to the annihilating wall of ice and theory.</v>

116
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.710
<v Speaker 1>On August the 25th thousands of white plantation owners were woken by gangs of</v>

117
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>slaves dragging them from their beds,</v>

118
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.483
<v Speaker 1>stabbing them,</v>

119
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.323
<v Speaker 1>shooting them,</v>

120
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>beating them to death.</v>

121
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>French children were dismembered.</v>

122
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Their heads displayed on poles outside of their former homes.</v>

123
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Fires were started.</v>

124
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Entire plantations bend to the grounds,</v>

125
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>the horizon,</v>

126
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the turns and apocalyptic read.</v>

127
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>The bloodshed was nearly worse.</v>

128
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.980
<v Speaker 1>The freed slaves in the countryside and the house slaves in the towns that</v>

129
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>intended to coordinate the uprising,</v>

130
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>but the field slaves jumped the gun and the whites and colors were able to</v>

131
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>rounds up and massacre the town's slaves,</v>

132
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>but it only put off the inevitable.</v>

133
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>By late September,</v>

134
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>over 100,000 slaves were in revolt and the cap was flooded with refugees.</v>

135
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Carrying horror stories of rape and mutilation,</v>

136
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>the Haitian revolution it had begun,</v>

137
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>so where was to solve in all of this while he was lying low,</v>

138
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>refusing to either join the uprising or to condemn it,</v>

139
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.180
<v Speaker 1>something he was simply waiting to see if the revolt was going to burn out.</v>

140
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Others think he was giving his distance in case of white reprisals.</v>

141
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the reason is,</v>

142
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>September into October,</v>

143
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>and the fires grew until the countryside looked like a vision of hell.</v>

144
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Fifty year olds to song finally made his choice.</v>

145
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.751
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

146
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>he shipped his wife and children off to Santa Domingo,</v>

147
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish colony occupying the other half of the islands today known as the</v>

148
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Dominican Republic.</v>

149
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Then he quietly smuggled his old wide master and his family onto a boat headed</v>

150
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>for the USA at lost with no one left to care for.</v>

151
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.540
<v Speaker 1>He freed,</v>

152
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>slave,</v>

153
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>abandoned his farm and disappeared into the forest.</v>

154
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>It was the start of what would become a remarkable career,</v>

155
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>but not straight away because of his medical knowledge to songs.</v>

156
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>First posting was less black and Napoleon and more male.</v>

157
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Florence Nightingale,</v>

158
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>a doctor for Georgia Bay ourselves.</v>

159
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Slave Amit,</v>

160
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>he kept out of the thick of the fighting as 70 91 raged on and the bodies began</v>

161
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>to pile high by the year's end,</v>

162
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.740
<v Speaker 1>some 4,000 whites and 15,000 blacks with debt.</v>

163
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>The economy was in ruins.</v>

164
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>The plantations were husks,</v>

165
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.710
<v Speaker 1>and a third of Omar was in the hands of the rebellious slaves by the time 1792.</v>

166
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Dawn's though to song was finally beginning to show his promised given 600</v>

167
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 1>minutes of commands,</v>

168
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>he quickly proved such an effective fighter that is ranks ballooned to 4,000,</v>

169
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>although we're still answering to buy or sell now effectively had his own army</v>

170
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.790
<v Speaker 1>among their number was Jacques,</v>

171
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Jack Dslr,</v>

172
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>a runaway slave who would become two songs and right on men.</v>

173
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.740
<v Speaker 1>While two songs on the gained fame for showing clemency to any whites they</v>

174
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:19.510
<v Speaker 1>captured.</v>

175
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the law when in the exact opposite direction,</v>

176
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>a sadist with an overwhelming hatred of whites.</v>

177
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>This alone which inflict old plantation punishments on his captives,</v>

178
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>gouging out eyes,</v>

179
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>and mutilating any French that he encountered before displaying their body parts</v>

180
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>on Pike's.</v>

181
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

182
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>it'd be wrong to call Dessa law,</v>

183
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>merely a psychopath.</v>

184
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Everything he did to his white captives had seen done by whites to slaves</v>

185
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 1>countless times before.</v>

186
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>White blonde had buried slaves alive,</v>

187
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>bore them to death,</v>

188
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>made them eat their own excrement.</v>

189
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>It said that the sleep of reason produces monsters.</v>

190
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.671
<v Speaker 1>that's a long,</v>

192
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>was the perfect monster for a system that has long ago lost all sense of reason</v>

193
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:00.481
<v Speaker 1>with decimals.</v>

194
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 1>How do song was able to capture a huge swath of the countries north as 17.</v>

195
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Ninety three began their partnership at turned to songs,</v>

196
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>fighters since perhaps the most effective slave army in Santa Monica.</v>

197
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.510
<v Speaker 1>It was at this time that he changed his name to look over it too,</v>

198
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>which can be read as opening the way a possible reference to his military</v>

199
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.004
<v Speaker 1>victories,</v>

200
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>but the war on Santa more had reached a kind of stalemate.</v>

201
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Whites were holed up in their cities.</v>

202
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>The colors were attempting to establish a separate state in the south.</v>

203
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 1>The other slave army commanders were just as powerful as to song what the</v>

204
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>commands are needed was an outside force that would come and give the entire war</v>

205
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 1>a gigantic shove.</v>

206
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Luckily that was bound to happen.</v>

207
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Seventy,</v>

208
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 1>93 is the year both Spain and Britain decided to invade sound them all.</v>

209
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It was the chaos in metropolitan mainland France that allowed the two</v>

210
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:56.860
<v Speaker 1>superpowers to act with impunity.</v>

211
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Seventeen 93 was the year of the reign of terror in the anarchy.</v>

212
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The revolution has unleashed.</v>

213
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.230
<v Speaker 1>No one had any time to care about what was happening in the colonies.</v>

214
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Sound them all has long been prized by other Caribbean powers in both London and</v>

215
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Madrid.</v>

216
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to take it,</v>

217
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.680
<v Speaker 1>but while the British just straight up invaded,</v>

218
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.870
<v Speaker 1>the Spaniards arrived with a plan.</v>

219
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>They're calling this in.</v>

220
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Santa Domingo opens communication channels with the slave army leaders promising</v>

221
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.470
<v Speaker 1>to respect their freedom.</v>

222
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.660
<v Speaker 1>If they fought for the Spanish crown,</v>

223
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 1>it was a political master stroke.</v>

224
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Most of the slave leaders signed up to fight for Madrid's,</v>

225
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.710
<v Speaker 1>including the if a tour.</v>

226
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>They were tired of France and so nothing new under a British regime accepts the</v>

227
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>change of language.</v>

228
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.891
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

229
00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>there were good reasons for thinking Luva too.</v>

230
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't exactly down with this pledge of allegiance to Spain that sorta bounce</v>

231
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.500
<v Speaker 1>of c come some of the remaining French troops in Santa Mall.</v>

232
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.160
<v Speaker 1>We're in a desperate position,</v>

233
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 1>but that fortunes,</v>

234
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>they were about to change.</v>

235
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>The chaos in Paris had briefly calmed down enough for the new revolutionary</v>

236
00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:02.480
<v Speaker 1>government to send out a delegation led by the portly abolitionist,</v>

237
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>leggings for the seat sown,</v>

238
00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:08.951
<v Speaker 1>Phonak's arriving in hazy sulfonex quickly divine's that there was only one way</v>

239
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:11.480
<v Speaker 1>to save the colony from implosion and conquest,</v>

240
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:15.730
<v Speaker 1>and it just so happened to align perfectly with his own beliefs on always the 29</v>

241
00:11:15.731 --> 00:11:17.030
<v Speaker 1>slash 17 slash 93.</v>

242
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.140
<v Speaker 1>He did the unthinkable.</v>

243
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.470
<v Speaker 1>He unilaterally freed all the slaves.</v>

244
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.450
<v Speaker 1>At first I didn't believe him,</v>

245
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but 17,</v>

246
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:25.760
<v Speaker 1>94 lumberton interview.</v>

247
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.930
<v Speaker 1>It became clear that not only did softball next mean to keep the slaves free,</v>

248
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>the governments in Paris actually backed him.</v>

249
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point the Louver tour and made the decision that would catapult</v>

250
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.270
<v Speaker 1>him to greatness over to us.</v>

251
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Army had taken control of the mountains,</v>

252
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.230
<v Speaker 1>giving them a natural,</v>

253
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:43.610
<v Speaker 1>easily defended base,</v>

254
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.360
<v Speaker 1>so over to your new that he was in a position of strength when he announced that</v>

255
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.190
<v Speaker 1>he was defecting from the Spanish.</v>

256
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.000
<v Speaker 1>From now on,</v>

257
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.920
<v Speaker 1>he would be fighting for the French.</v>

258
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>The decision changed course of the war.</v>

259
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Labor deals army marched down from the mountains and decimated the Spanish</v>

260
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>forces and their black allies.</v>

261
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Generals who nominally been over to her superiors only days before found</v>

262
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:08.970
<v Speaker 1>themselves forced into retreat into Santa Domingo as an overseer.</v>

263
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Cabs driving forwards.</v>

264
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:13.820
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish eventually capitulated having just lost her separate water.</v>

265
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:14.651
<v Speaker 1>France in Europe.</v>

266
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:18.790
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to give up Santa Domingo that vanquished black allies while they</v>

267
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 1>were sent into exile,</v>

268
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.100
<v Speaker 1>but Louver tour.</v>

269
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't done yet,</v>

270
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>but fitting his army around.</v>

271
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>He now launched his full force against the coastal cities occupied by the</v>

272
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 1>British.</v>

273
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Although the British would cling onto their sound Amar enclaves for a few more</v>

274
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:32.854
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

275
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.693
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>

276
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.660
<v Speaker 1>it was up under new verticals,</v>

277
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.310
<v Speaker 1>onslaught.</v>

278
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.310
<v Speaker 1>They were beaten down until the general was able to make peace on his own terms,</v>

279
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>the deal that Britain could restart trading with sound Amar on solar condition</v>

280
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that louverture refrained from fermenting,</v>

281
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 1>slave rebellion in Jamaica,</v>

282
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.220
<v Speaker 1>sends it over to your new British trade would be Kasia rebuilding the wall,</v>

283
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>shattered economy.</v>

284
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>This was a win win.</v>

285
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 1>You've got everything you wanted,</v>

286
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.470
<v Speaker 1>and the British got to back out with a shred of dignity,</v>

287
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:05.350
<v Speaker 1>still intact as the British slowly packed up and left over to her,</v>

288
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>turned his attention to the difficult problem of peace for the remaining whites</v>

289
00:13:09.481 --> 00:13:10.301
<v Speaker 1>and colors.</v>

290
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>This would have been a time of paralyzing fear.</v>

291
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>The slave armies were notorious for their massacres and life under a former</v>

292
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>slave must have been terrifying.</v>

293
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:20.044
<v Speaker 1>Prospect.</v>

294
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>They have not counted on the overdose greatness rather than reprisals.</v>

295
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Lived here pursued a policy of reconciliation.</v>

296
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 1>He forgave war crimes committed by whites.</v>

297
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>He invited the plantation owners back,</v>

298
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>offering them the same plantations that owns before and the chance to make their</v>

299
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 1>money back.</v>

300
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 1>He instituted a policy of colorblindness.</v>

301
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would be equal and no white would persecute any black,</v>

302
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 1>just as no black would take vengeance upon any white for the slaves.</v>

303
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.340
<v Speaker 1>He maintained their freedom.</v>

304
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.510
<v Speaker 1>They would have to return to the old plantations and work for two years,</v>

305
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but they would receive wages and corporal punishments would be banned after the</v>

306
00:13:56.931 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 1>two years were up.</v>

307
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>That'd be free to go wherever they pleased it's moments such as these,</v>

308
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:02.441
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

309
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Why do you sold over to your remains a fascinating figure.</v>

310
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>There was a man who just spent five years fighting a brutal race war and now he</v>

311
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>was extending the hand of friendship to the very people who tried to kill him</v>

312
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.430
<v Speaker 1>and all of interest to general.</v>

313
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.060
<v Speaker 1>The video was capable of being a statesman who's pragmatism,</v>

314
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>good Bible Washington's,</v>

315
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>but there was still a dark side to leave it to you and it went by the name of</v>

316
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Joel.</v>

317
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>

318
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 1>This along in the carnage of the civil war.</v>

319
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:29.471
<v Speaker 1>The colored said,</v>

320
00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:34.471
<v Speaker 1>succeeded in carving out a small state in the south under the command of Andre</v>

321
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Rigor in 1799,</v>

322
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.520
<v Speaker 1>low poverty or send us along down to terminate the outpost,</v>

323
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>which decimal did with extreme prejudice.</v>

324
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 1>The war of knives was brutal.</v>

325
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't all slaughtered anyone who could even conceivably be a supporter of</v>

326
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>rigo leaving a trail of death in his wake.</v>

327
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.930
<v Speaker 1>While Lovato was busy consolidating power in the north by exiling something</v>

328
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>accent of the French authorities.</v>

329
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the little town in the south into central wasteland.</v>

330
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:02.810
<v Speaker 1>That reconciliation with the colored became impossible.</v>

331
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.521
<v Speaker 1>Bloody is.</v>

332
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It was the war of knives did succeed and reunifying Santa Mall for the first</v>

333
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 1>time since 17,</v>

334
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:09.771
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

335
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.771
<v Speaker 1>The entire country was under the control of one man and that man was over to</v>

336
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

337
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 1>As the clock ticked over in the 19th century,</v>

338
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:20.690
<v Speaker 1>began louvered here was slowly rebuilding the economy,</v>

339
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 1>reestablishing race relations between blacks and whites and making plans to</v>

340
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 1>eliminate slavery in Santa Domingo.</v>

341
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

342
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>this extraordinary man was at the peak of his career.</v>

343
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 1>It would take the arrival on the world stage of a man even more extraordinary</v>

344
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>than lower tier to stop him.</v>

345
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for the population of Santa Monica,</v>

346
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>that man was already waiting in the wings,</v>

347
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 1>just as the Black Napoleon was consolidating,</v>

348
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 1>has control over Sandamala in Europe,</v>

349
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the Real Napoleon was doing the same thing with France.</v>

350
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Seventeen 99,</v>

351
00:15:58.491 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

352
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon Bonaparte go from being a general in the revolutionary army to first</v>

353
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>console of France as it is with many great men.</v>

354
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:08.600
<v Speaker 1>One stage simply wasn't big enough for both of them.</v>

355
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.231
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

356
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's first acts was to declare the French colonies would be governed by</v>

357
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 1>special rules,</v>

358
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:19.200
<v Speaker 1>meaning the declaration of the rights of men would not apply since over to your</v>

359
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.431
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

360
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>has not actually declared independence from France.</v>

361
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Instead of insisting that he was ruling on behalf of Paris,</v>

362
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.990
<v Speaker 1>this was something of a problem.</v>

363
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew that a slave economy could not be ruled by a former slave.</v>

364
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Not that things went immediately south though Louver to you publicly praised</v>

365
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:35.811
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon,</v>

366
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>recognizing him as the new leader of France,</v>

367
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>and he swore his loyalty to him.</v>

368
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>His actions seem to mollify Napoleon,</v>

369
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.860
<v Speaker 1>the first consult confirms that over too,</v>

370
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 1>as the legitimate leader of the colony of Santa Monica,</v>

371
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but he also issued him with a warning.</v>

372
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Lova too,</v>

373
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 1>was not under any circumstances to invade Santa Domingo.</v>

374
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 1>So now can you guess what you're did next?</v>

375
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.001
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

376
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Santa Domingo was a vassal state,</v>

377
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 1>technically ruled by frogs,</v>

378
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but still in the hands of Spanish administrators.</v>

379
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It also continued to practice slavery,</v>

380
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 1>something lovatare couldn't tolerate his on his doorstep.</v>

381
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:11.841
<v Speaker 1>In Eighteen,</v>

382
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:13.100
<v Speaker 1>oh one he marched in,</v>

383
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 1>sees the country and declared slavery abolished back in France.</v>

384
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 1>The mouth hits the ventilator incense to bind it over to his actions.</v>

385
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 1>The government demanded something be done.</v>

386
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon himself,</v>

387
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:26.144
<v Speaker 1>he communicated.</v>

388
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.050
<v Speaker 1>He had a vague plans.</v>

389
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Who invade America has recognized that sound.</v>

390
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Amal slave armies could help make that dream a reality,</v>

391
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.700
<v Speaker 1>but his wounded ego eventually got the better of him at the end of 18.</v>

392
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:36.801
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

393
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:37.011
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

394
00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 1>The first console dispatched a military expedition under the control of Charles.</v>

395
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Look to retake sound mall.</v>

396
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Not long after he passed the Lore of May the 20th bringing slavery back to the</v>

397
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:47.714
<v Speaker 1>colonies.</v>

398
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It was the beginning of the ends of both do sauna over tour and French control</v>

399
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>of Santa Maher on paper over to you should have been able to rally popular</v>

400
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 1>support in the face of a French invasion.</v>

401
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

402
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 1>in reality is new equal society was not very popular.</v>

403
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 1>The economy was still a shambles and the returned whites resented the empowered</v>

404
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 1>blacks.</v>

405
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.850
<v Speaker 1>The colored still remember decimals atrocities.</v>

406
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.923
<v Speaker 1>The blacks,</v>

407
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

408
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they may have technically been free,</v>

409
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but they were still stuck on that plantations of the three major demographics</v>

410
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:20.484
<v Speaker 1>and we'll send them all,</v>

411
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.390
<v Speaker 1>not one felt comfortable with the inverters.</v>

412
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix state as look like made landfall.</v>

413
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.641
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

414
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:30.810
<v Speaker 1>the whites flocked to his side and the colored and then many of the slaves.</v>

415
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

416
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.840
<v Speaker 1>even George drank the salon turns on his old friends and through his lot in with</v>

417
00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the French and this one,</v>

418
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>it was the end for lower tier.</v>

419
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>After a few months of token resistance over to your contact at the clerk and</v>

420
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>promise today down his arms in exchange for a guarantee that the French would</v>

421
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 1>not reimpose.</v>

422
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Slavery began like agreed on two songs,</v>

423
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 1>suspended military operations,</v>

424
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.000
<v Speaker 1>retiring to his old farm.</v>

425
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 1>He was surprised with an invitation to meet a French general at an out of the</v>

426
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Speaker 1>way plantation.</v>

427
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It was clearly a trap,</v>

428
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but over to here was maybe just too tired by his sudden fall from power by that</v>

429
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

430
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever the reason he accepted as he arrived at the meeting spot,</v>

431
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.470
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested under the orders of Napoleon himself and deported France to solo</v>

432
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.730
<v Speaker 1>over to your manual,</v>

433
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.270
<v Speaker 1>had freed the slaves are ruled sound all for one brief shining moments would</v>

434
00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>never see us home again.</v>

435
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Send to the Jura mountains in southern France.</v>

436
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Liberty.</v>

437
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I spent the next year being beaten,</v>

438
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.003
<v Speaker 1>neglected,</v>

439
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.083
<v Speaker 1>and left to rot.</v>

440
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.610
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a bits like the dreamed a lot,</v>

441
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but in the cold mountain,</v>

442
00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:33.680
<v Speaker 1>air is health collapsed by this point,</v>

443
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 1>a man in his sixties,</v>

444
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:36.480
<v Speaker 1>lover to as body soon failed him.</v>

445
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 1>He succumbs to repeated infections before finally slipping away.</v>

446
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>On April the seventh,</v>

447
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.371
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

448
00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:42.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

449
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.580
<v Speaker 1>three black is white counterpart woods.</v>

450
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 1>In 20 years,</v>

451
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 1>the Black Napoleon died alone,</v>

452
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.720
<v Speaker 1>unloved,</v>

453
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.870
<v Speaker 1>and an exile is achievements seemingly forgotten.</v>

454
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Before he went over to her,</v>

455
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.480
<v Speaker 1>did have time to write his thoughts down on Santa Monica Future.</v>

456
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.890
<v Speaker 1>He felt the genie was out of the bottle and soon another black like in would</v>

457
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 1>come along to permanently free the slaves and expel the French.</v>

458
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.380
<v Speaker 1>He was more right than he knew.</v>

459
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>As he lay dying.</v>

460
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.120
<v Speaker 1>That's along.</v>

461
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I had switched sides again.</v>

462
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.340
<v Speaker 1>The cleric responded by trying to commit genocide against the slave population.</v>

463
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Even using ship holds filled with fumes as primitive gas chambers.</v>

464
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>This was a bad decision.</v>

465
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 1>The dark force driving decile law was more than equal to the clerks.</v>

466
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Demons stands in a genocidal war.</v>

467
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>They could only be one winner in 18.</v>

468
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:28.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

469
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>three decimal systematically exterminated.</v>

470
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.390
<v Speaker 1>All of the whites in more men,</v>

471
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:33.840
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

472
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.231
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

473
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:34.621
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

474
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:35.370
<v Speaker 1>civilians,</v>

475
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.050
<v Speaker 1>each were butchered by a caravan of death that offered no mercy.</v>

476
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.011
<v Speaker 1>Only polls,</v>

477
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Brits and Americans were spared the former because many of them had arrived with</v>

478
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the clerical.</v>

479
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 1>You need to switch sides the latter to you purely because that's a long knew</v>

480
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>that he needed British and American trade to rebuild the economy.</v>

481
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 1>The Clark himself didn't live to see this final French defeat.</v>

482
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 1>He died of yellow fever in November of 18.</v>

483
00:20:58.331 --> 00:20:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

484
00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:58.721
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

485
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Just after launching his campaign of genocide on January the first 18,</v>

486
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:02.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

487
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>four dozen law renames the nation Pacey and declared independence from France.</v>

488
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 1>The slaves had done the impossible that fought for their freedom and then one,</v>

489
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 1>although Haiti would endure centuries of economic misery,</v>

490
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:16.540
<v Speaker 1>natural disasters,</v>

491
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 1>and occupation by powers including the United States,</v>

492
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.870
<v Speaker 1>it would never again be ruled by France.</v>

493
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.770
<v Speaker 1>All of this happens because of one man to Solon.</v>

494
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.201
<v Speaker 1>Level two,</v>

495
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.940
<v Speaker 1>you may not have lived to see it,</v>

496
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 1>but his nation could never have one.</v>

497
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It's freedom without him.</v>

498
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's thanks to the Black Napoleon that Santa more didn't really become another</v>

499
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>British or Spanish outpost,</v>

500
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's thanks to his insistence on ending slavery that Haitians remained free</v>

501
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>from 1794 onwards.</v>

502
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.700
<v Speaker 1>It was a great commander,</v>

503
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 1>a shrewd statesman,</v>

504
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>and a man who tirelessly advocated for racial equality.</v>

505
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.110
<v Speaker 1>His dream of creating an equal sound,</v>

506
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Amal may have failed,</v>

507
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 1>but it was a noble dream or the same for that reason,</v>

508
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>if no other to soul life for cure the slave,</v>

509
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it became a leader deserves to be remembered.</v>

510
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 1>So I really hope you found that video interest,</v>
