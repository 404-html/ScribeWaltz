1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.850
He's American literature,
Titan of terror,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.960
the writer who created some of the most iconic names in Scifi and there's 46

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.220
short years of life.
HP Lovecraft was responsible for the alien God Catula,

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.390
the necronomicon book of the dead and the whole entire town of [inaudible] where

5
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:17.550
things always go bump in the night.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.130
He inspired everyone from Stephen King to Jorge.

7
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:22.830
Luis Borges has to the writers of Batman.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.970
His work is so penetrated pop culture that you can even buy a plush toys of his

9
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.700
creepiest monsters.
Yesterday,

10
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.070
HP Lovecraft was a man virtually unknown in his lifetime,

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
living as a recluse in Rhode Island's,
he created a sprawling fictional universe,

12
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.490
the fused traditional horror with cutting edge science in new and revolutionary

13
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:45.600
ways,
and then he died before more than a handful of people could read it.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.530
In the video today,
we explore how this virtual home has overcame sickness,

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.513
isolation,

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.610
and his own foul prejudices to become the 20th centuries master of horror.

17
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
<v 0>One of the recurring themes in Lovecraft's work is ordinary families hiding dark</v>

19
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.550
secrets in their lineage.

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.970
You don't have to look too hard to find the inspiration.
For this.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710
When August the 20th 1890 Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born into the stately

22
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:20.280
ancestral home of one of the oldest families in Providence.

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.210
His mother's side were wealthy aristocrats with rumors of inbreeding in their

24
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:28.350
backgrounds while his father was a traveling salesman already suffering from

25
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.800
undiagnosed syphilis before young Howard was even three,

26
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.830
his dad had a nervous breakdown brought on by his disease and he was confined as

27
00:01:35.831 --> 00:01:39.090
to a lunatic asylum.
Although the old man lived in another five years,

28
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:43.500
Lovecraft had never see him again despite the obvious bag Lovecraft's mother

29
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.680
Sarah tried to give her child a relatively normal life.

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.590
The two moved in with her father,
the incredibly wealthy,

31
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.950
gloriously mustachioed whipple van Buren,
Phillips.

32
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.240
It was here that Lovecraft got his first taste for the uncanny.
One of ripples.

33
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:01.170
Party tricks was to invent trining ghost stories just off the cuff,

34
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.090
much to the delight of his grandson,

35
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.980
still whipple cousins makeup for the obvious hole in young Lovecraft's life from

36
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:09.810
almost the day that his father collapsed.

37
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.130
Lovecraft was paralyzed by psychological maladies.
At the age of six,

38
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:18.120
he began having night terrors of faceless men that were so acute that he would

39
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:19.590
be left trembling for days.

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.000
Perhaps it's no surprise that he burning attended school well that Sarah was

41
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.090
raising a dumb dumb.
We're both house was stacked with books.

42
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.300
Even Danzy missed school.
Lovecraft,

43
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.600
who was reading his way through the Arabian nights through Edgar Allan Poe and

44
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.670
even into scientific journals.

45
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.650
By 1898 Lovecraft was a self declared atheist scientist producing his own

46
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.730
homemade made magazines on geology.
Strange as his childhood was.

47
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.230
It was at least stable,
but sadly that's not something that would last.

48
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.250
On march the 27th of 1904 whipple suffered a massive stroke.

49
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.370
He died the next day immediately Lovecraft's life.

50
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.620
It was turned completely upside down.

51
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.890
It turns out Whipple's finances had been badly mismanaged within days of his

52
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.810
death.
The of Croft and his mother,
Sarah,

53
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.380
were evicted from the house and forced to move into a cramped apartment.

54
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.730
The shock was so great.

55
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.500
This Lovecraft by now a boy of 14 contemplator drowning himself and the

56
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.490
Barrington river,

57
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.280
although it wouldn't come out into the open for a few more years.

58
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.630
The day we pulled died is effectively the day that Sarah and her son both when

59
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:27.631
mad in 1908 Lovecraft would suffer a catastrophic breakdown largely related to

60
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.420
the tragedy,
unable to finish high school,
been able to attend university.

61
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.580
He locked himself away with his mother,

62
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.360
cutting off all contact from society over the next five years.

63
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.390
The past relationship at talent toxic if we Paul's death or damaged Lovecraft's

64
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:43.780
it had twisted Sarah.

65
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.190
She became verbally abusive towards her teenage son calling him grow task and

66
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.140
telling him to never leave her side.

67
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.130
By 1913 the two were living as codependent recluses Lovecraft's.

68
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.540
He never left home before sunset and spend his endless free time doing nothing.

69
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.160
Bitter reading pulp magazines.

70
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.420
It's at this time that he seems to have developed both crippling social anxiety

71
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.040
and is abnormal fear of the cold in shorts Lovecraft's life.

72
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.120
There was painfully depressing poor backing in friends and goals.

73
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.720
He was in danger of simply vanishing from the history books,

74
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.860
but his life was about to be saved by the unlikeliest of heroes,

75
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.330
a romance novelist.

76
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.590
You've probably never heard of Fred Jackson that,

77
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.650
how'd you mentioned his name to HP Lovecraft.

78
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:37.651
In 1913 the Rhode Island's recluse would have vomited up blood ashamed of this

79
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.700
trash merchants Pyrex excellence.

80
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.640
Jackson's is in sippet tales of cliched loved stuff.

81
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:45.610
The pages of the Argosy and magazine Lovecraft,

82
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.930
perhaps somewhat masochistically often ret finally fed up with this hack.

83
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.040
Lovecraft did exactly what any angry weirdo living alone with his mum would do.

84
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.960
He totally trolled him.

85
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.140
Three 1913 Lovecraft sent a sea of letters to the Argosy attacking Jackson's

86
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:06.190
lack of talents and each time he did it in rhyme.
It was a bizarre thing to do.

87
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.080
It was almost childish,

88
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.650
but it was the thing that actually made Lovecraft's Korea.

89
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.470
By 1914 this weird letter writer has reached the attention of Edward F das

90
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.240
presidents of the United Amateur Press Association.

91
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:21.580
The Uae Pa intrigues Dasa,

92
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.380
read some of Lovecraft's Andy Jackson poems.
Apparently he likes them.

93
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.610
He offered Lovecraft a job and so began one of the unlikeliest literary careers

94
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.623
in history,

95
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.620
perhaps flattered by Dawson's attention to the 24 year old Lovecraft's took two

96
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.540
amateur press work like an unspeakable.
See Demon water.
He rose assays,

97
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.280
published magazines,
composed poems.

98
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.310
He even finally left as mother's stifling embrace and made some friends and good

99
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:51.670
job too because it was those friends who convinced him to try his hand at

100
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.120
fiction.
Lovecraft's had written fiction stories as a child,

101
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.960
but never really anything serious until the summer of 1917 that was when the now

102
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:04.790
27 year old Lovecraft sat down and wrote Dagon the story of a ship wreck sailor

103
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.630
who finds himself trapped and mysterious island filled with the ruins of some

104
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:11.510
hideous civilization.
Dagon is a short,

105
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.511
creepy piece that already contains the seeds of Lovecraft's greatest works.

106
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.190
It's freezing.
Read online by the way,
if he fancies and my homework,

107
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.300
but the important point is that this is the moment.

108
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.330
This is the moment when love to the weird lonely recluse vanished hens love

109
00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:32.960
Croft to the weird lonely writer arrived.

110
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.900
Not that this transition came without tragedy.

111
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.030
In 1919 Lovecraft's mother's Sarah had a total breakdown confined to the same

112
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.900
lunatic asylum.

113
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.310
Our husband died and she spent two more years raving before finally dying

114
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:51.170
herself in May of 1921 suddenly often still too strange to fend for himself.

115
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.280
Love graft was taken in by a snobbish ons.
Lillian Clark and and he,

116
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.720
he Phillips GAM.
Well,
this would not be a happy relationship,

117
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.130
but before we dive into that,

118
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.310
it's time we introduced the last significant character in the life of HP

119
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.090
Lovecraft.
Sonya huffed green,
a Russian Jews seven years.

120
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.570
Loved Croft Senior Sonja was a phase noon on the amateur,

121
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:18.890
pressing independently wealthy from how successful hat store sheet bankrolled

122
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.760
several low budget magazine that eight two weeks off to Sarah's death.

123
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.410
Sonia was visiting a UAP,

124
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:28.700
a convention in Boston when she was introduced to the new knee orphan Lovecraft.

125
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.180
Somehow the two hit it off,
well followed.

126
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:34.130
It wasn't exactly a Fred Jackson's style romance.

127
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.300
Love Croft was so disinterested in sex that Sonia had to cut journeyman's making

128
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.380
love by giving him textbooks on romance to study.
Perhaps not surprisingly,

129
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.290
she would lay to claim Lovecraft was a virgin when they met.

130
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.270
Still the two really did like one another.

131
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.570
On March the third 1924 they went in a secret ceremony only informing

132
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.470
Lovecraft's disapproving aunts by letter,
not long.

133
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:58.190
Officer Lovecraft left Rhode Island's and moved in with so near in New York.

134
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.250
There was spring 1924 and life was good.

135
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.510
Lovecraft was having his first stories professionally published in weird tales

136
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.790
and sending us how to business was booming,

137
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.430
things they were finally getting on track,

138
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.570
excepts of course it couldn't last.
Sonia was unwell.

139
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.230
By the end of 1924 her illness was eating up so much of her time,

140
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.080
but the hap sharp had gone bust.
Loved crafted.
Meanwhile,

141
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:31.520
bungled is one shot at a stable income by turning down the opportunity to add

142
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.690
arrival,
a pulp magazine.

143
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.720
Weird Tales come Christmas of 1924 the two what broke on January the first 1925

144
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:43.310
Sonia moved alone to Cleveland to take up a job left behind in New York.

145
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:46.910
Lovecraft rented a tiny apartment in Brooklyn's notorious red hook.

146
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.270
It was a mistake that would hold him for the rest of his life.

147
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.330
Lovecraft hated rhetoric.
He absolutely hated it,

148
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.400
surrounded by immigrants suddenly alone and broke again.

149
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.630
He descended into a twisted business that found it's expression in the worst

150
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:03.300
kind of racism.
Yes,
it's time for us.

151
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.330
Talk about the demonic elder God in the room.

152
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.170
Lovecraft was a bounding,
are racist.
That sort of person,

153
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.990
it's hard to believe exists outside of daily stormer.

154
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:15.450
Message boards in 1912 for example,

155
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:20.451
age 22 he had written a poem referring to black people as beasts and semi human

156
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:25.620
figures.
He was also a raging anti-semite.
He wants roads of New York City.

157
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.150
The population is a Mongrel herd with repulsive mongoloid Jews in the visible

158
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.620
majority and as the course faces and bad manners eventually come to where?

159
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:39.621
On one so unbearably that one feels like punching every God damn bastard in

160
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.970
sight.
Yikes.
Let's dweeby accused of unfair treatment.

161
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:49.971
We should note here that Lovecraft's racism was more complex than it first

162
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:53.490
appears.
You probably remember from 10 minutes ago that his wife,
Sonia,

163
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.270
was herself Jewish.
Well,
she wasn't the only Jewish friend.

164
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.260
That Lovecraft hat tablet magazine notes that the pope writer Robert Bloch who

165
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:04.020
would later pen the novel Alfred Hitchcock's psycho is based on.

166
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.680
It was a friend of Lovecraft's and so was the poet Samuel Loveman.

167
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.340
Love grew up then with a man who was openly racist,

168
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:15.720
but in the abstract sense faced with people he personally likes.

169
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:19.170
He weren't White Protestants.
Lovecraft seemed to have no problems.

170
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.850
Discarding is racial beliefs,

171
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.260
not that there weren't many people love Croft liked in red hook though as an ID

172
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.150
25 drags on the reclusive writers,

173
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:30.870
feelings towards foreigners turns into something close to horror.

174
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.580
The dreads he felt surrounded by a sea of non white faces turned into a genuine

175
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:36.414
phobia.

176
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.830
It's since been argued that this phobia influenced Lovecraft's work itself with

177
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:43.920
his tales of nameless forces and unknowable aliens.

178
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:48.090
It's not too much of a stretch to think that Lovecraft was simply channeling his

179
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.980
inner feelings towards New York's multicultural population.
If that is the case,

180
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.610
well at least we can save that something good came of his very poisonous

181
00:10:56.611 --> 00:11:00.000
thoughts.
By early 1926 Lovecraft had had enough.

182
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:02.880
He wrote to his aunt's Linnaean and Annie begging them for help.

183
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.430
The two agreed to engineer his return to Providence,

184
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:10.380
but at a price Sonia would not move to Rhode Islands and she would never see a

185
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:14.850
husband again,
exhausted,
desperate to get away from the city.
He hated so much.

186
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.000
Lovecraft agreed,
although he's still claim to love Sonia.

187
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.080
He moved back to providence on April the 17th 1926 and he would never see his

188
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:24.444
wife again

189
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.690
in some of 1926 the hideous creature rose out of the waters of the South
Pacific,

190
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.120
a monster,
a vaguely anthropoid outline,

191
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:42.830
but with an octopus like head whose face was a mess of feelers,

192
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.810
a Scaly,
rubbery looking body,

193
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:49.811
prodigious clause on the hind and four feet and long barrow wing's behind the

194
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:55.420
monster tower,
not just over all who saw it,
a bit over horror fiction itself.

195
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.860
It's name was Cathy Hulu,

196
00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:00.700
and it was to become the most important of all of Lovecraft's creations.

197
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.140
The star of a short story.

198
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:05.620
The cool of Kathy Luca [inaudible] was Lovecraft's first creation after

199
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.310
returning to providence and elder gone to biding his time in the depths of the

200
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:13.180
sea waiting for the moment humanity will awaken him and destroy the worlds

201
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.040
through new has gripped our imaginations ever since this even a region on Pluto

202
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.260
named after him.
Yes,
at the moment.

203
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.520
He first raised is unspeakable head from the waves could through new seemed

204
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.180
destined.
Obscurity newly arrived back from New York.

205
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:30.750
Love Croft had little hope for his latest Amman,

206
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.600
steady on the small paycheck and some fleeting recognition.
Luckily,

207
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.820
the his friends,
they had other ideas.

208
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.360
Do you remember we talked about how Lovecraft finally made some real friends off

209
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:43.930
to join you.
The UAP a way back in 1914 well,
over the years,

210
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:48.020
that evolved into quite the little circle of pen pals among the number where

211
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.290
robots block of psycho fame.
Robert Howard,

212
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:53.050
the creator of Conan the barbarian ans writer,
August,

213
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.920
done with who's about to become really,
really important.

214
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:59.410
It's in about five minutes.
When these guys read cathedral,

215
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.400
they went absolutely nuts.
Cathedral,
it was something new.

216
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.450
They encouraged everyone in Lovecraft circle to start writing their own tails

217
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.030
set in the same universe over the next decade.

218
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:12.940
The grip would build up something called the [inaudible] ethos.

219
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.630
It's the reason we still remember the character of [inaudible] today.

220
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.580
At the same time as this mythos was growing,

221
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:21.940
Lovecraft wins through his most productive streak is a writer.

222
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.990
Something about moving back to Rhode Island's has energized him and a handful of

223
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:29.620
years he wrote some of his greatest hits,
the color out of space,

224
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:34.420
the case of Charles Dex towards the shadow of ins mouth and the mountains of

225
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:36.390
madness.
If you don't have to love Croft Fan,

226
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.700
just know that this is like the Beatles knocking out sergeant pepper,

227
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:43.540
the white album,
yellow submarine and Abbey Road,
one after the other.

228
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.770
It was a muster working at his peak come during vistas of Psych,

229
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:52.240
clippy and alien cities and Eldridge horizontal like anything readers had ever

230
00:13:52.241 --> 00:13:53.440
experienced before.

231
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.250
Luftwaffe may have been living in semi poverty with too domineering aunts and no

232
00:13:57.251 --> 00:13:58.570
access to the woman he loved,

233
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.840
but it was clearly doing wonders for his productivity.

234
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.020
Even the Bruising Wall Street crash of 1929 fail to dentists newfound enthusiasm

235
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.740
as the 19th that he's got underway.

236
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:13.060
He was scraping together enough funds to take loan joints along the coast of his

237
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.200
beloved New England's.

238
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.950
But if there's one thing we've learned about Lovecraft's life so far,

239
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.160
it's that all good things must come to a terrible ends and soon enough they did.

240
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.983
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.280
<v 0>In 1932 Lovecraft's aren't.</v>

242
00:14:32.281 --> 00:14:35.880
Lillian Clark died despite her overbearing personality.

243
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.270
Lovecraft was devastated.
He and his surviving arms Annie,

244
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:41.370
were forced to move into a tiny apartments.

245
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.340
It was the beginning of a long slide into grinding poverty.

246
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.640
Lovecraft may have been writing his greatest work at this point,

247
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:52.220
but his greatest work,
it was long,
complex stuff and it has no mass appeal.

248
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.570
What he and then he needed work short,
punchy tales that he could sell regularly.

249
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.170
Not something like the Antarctic horror of at the mountains of madness,

250
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:02.570
which took five years to find a buyer.

251
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.070
The love graphs have too much integrity or perhaps too much stupidity to lower

252
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.730
his standards.
Ponies on ghost writing work in order to survive.

253
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.360
Way Back in 1924 had ghostwritten into south of Harry Houdini and the two had

254
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.140
become friends,
so maybe this would be just as rewarding.
Sadly,

255
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.160
it was not to be the ghost writing of Lovecraft's final years took up all of his

256
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:25.760
time and left him drains and just pour.
Has it ever been,

257
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.810
he took to eating tens of expired food in order to survive and that was only

258
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:31.190
when he could afford to eat at all.

259
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.000
Perhaps one of the positive achievements Lovecraft made in these gloomy years

260
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:39.050
was to keep up his letter writing from the days of his trolling as is to the

261
00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:39.740
Augusti.

262
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.450
Lovecraft had composed letters with a commitments rarely seen before or since

263
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.240
it's estimated he sent a hundred thousand letters in his lifetime,

264
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:50.320
second only to the great French philosopher Voltaire.

265
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.180
By spring 1936 Lovecraft had almost given up on his fiction,
his own.

266
00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:58.460
These stories since 1933 had been the shadow out of time.

267
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.500
Now considered a late class seconds,
the creepy but short hunter of the dark.

268
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.650
So why this sudden lack of interest in alien worlds,

269
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.130
but it may have been because Lovecraft had found something else to write about.

270
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.050
In the Cold New England winter of 1935 to 1936 Lovecraft had begun documenting

271
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:18.890
an illness that he was suffering from that he called the grip.

272
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.880
This script was actually cancer as 1936 war on it,

273
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.310
ate away at his intestines until his insides.

274
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:29.930
What riddled with tumors like the Rec Lucy was Lovecraft refuse to see a doctor

275
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.810
that's on the more bad news came Robert Howard,

276
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:36.710
the Conan writer and friend of Lovecraft committed suicide by shooting himself

277
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:37.490
in the head.

278
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.900
The death of his pen pal sent Lovecraft's spiraling into depression from which

279
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.070
he never fully recovered.

280
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.120
By spring 1937 it was all as you clear that something was deeply wrong.

281
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.870
Lovecraft had written nothing but four poems in over a year.

282
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.320
He was in constant agony and consumed by black thoughts.

283
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.160
Often he would sit alone at night in the cold and gloomy apartments haunting the

284
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.220
darkened room like one of his own creations.

285
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.550
On march the 10th 1937 the pain and finally became too much.

286
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.000
Lovecraft checked himself into the Jane Brown Memorial Hospital,

287
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.650
but by now the cancer had gone far too beyond what any treatment could take care

288
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:13.040
of.

289
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.040
Five days later on March the 15th of 1937 HP Lovecraft passed away and his last

290
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:21.860
moments.
It's possible the ones in what would become of his work after he died.

291
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.820
If he did,

292
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.630
we can only assume that he thought his writings scattered across cheap pulp

293
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:31.550
magazines would soon be forgotten,
but he had encountered on August Dartmouth

294
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.220
rather,
how we mentioned that August data.

295
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:42.030
If it was one of Lovecraft's writer friends and was going to be really,

296
00:17:42.031 --> 00:17:46.740
really important to this story at some points,
well this is points often.

297
00:17:46.741 --> 00:17:47.550
Lovecraft died.

298
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.540
Delyth decided to give the old their literary send off that he deserved.

299
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.460
In August of 1939 Duluth founded [inaudible] house publishes specifically to put

300
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:58.950
out hardback additions of Lovecraft stories.

301
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.220
The outsider and others is a at the same,
yeah,

302
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.050
runs was resoundingly not a success.

303
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.700
It's advanced orders came to him in 150 copies when one wound up at the New York

304
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.430
has officers,
they gave it a dreadful review.

305
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.590
But here's the thing about Dartmouth.

306
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.880
He may have been a hack writer who utterly failed to grasp what Lovecraft was

307
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:19.080
trying to do with this fiction,

308
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.340
but he was a loyal friends and he was also a friend who just happened to have

309
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:27.780
very deep pockets.
Over the next few years to UNEF kept all come house afloat,

310
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.630
pushing out volume after volume of Lovecraft's tales.

311
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.270
He even had them translated into foreign languages.

312
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.780
This turned out to be an excellent move over in postwar France.

313
00:18:36.781 --> 00:18:40.470
The French translations of Lovecraft's well became hugely popular.

314
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.860
It helps that Paris intellectuals already considered and to go around and

315
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.540
there's a retired and then none of Lovecraft was clearly posed.

316
00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:52.541
20th Century success up by the 1960s Lovecraft Croft was so popular abroad that

317
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:56.880
it made financial sense for all can house to rerelease his story state side.

318
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.310
The timing simply couldn't have been better.

319
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.630
Lovecraft reappeared on the scene just as a new wave of films was making horror

320
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.840
popular again,
raising Mary's baby night of the living dead knocked.

321
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:10.650
You mentioned the first us release of Britain's hammer horror films sparked a

322
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:14.730
surge of interest in weird fiction legions of people you'd never read horror or

323
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:16.790
Saifai flocked to Lovecraft.

324
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.270
But in the 1970s the gentleman from providence at a serious fan base,

325
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.110
what followed,

326
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.950
was a dizzying embrace of an offer who'd only ever risen football magazines.

327
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.570
In 1974 Batman's writers borrowed the idea of Arkham asylum from Lovecraft's.

328
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.530
In 1977 Superfan,

329
00:19:32.531 --> 00:19:36.630
Stephen King exploded onto the literary scene with Carrie and spent the rest of

330
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:40.230
his career encouraging others to read Lovecraft.
That same year,

331
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.130
a group of American fans cobbled together enough cash to replace Lovecraft small

332
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:46.300
tombstone with a gigantic state.

333
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:51.130
Anyone battering the legend I providence the culture of Lovecraft's link the

334
00:19:51.131 --> 00:19:54.930
cults that gather around the great cathedral and his stories could no longer be

335
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:58.540
ignored in the year since that myth of love,
Croft has only grown.

336
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.110
Today's story's invented the Canon of American fiction,

337
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.260
both penguin classics and Library of America for at least volumes.

338
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.450
People as diverse as Neil Gaiman,
Alan Moore,

339
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:09.270
and gamma to Tara have been influenced by him.

340
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.620
He's arguably the best known horror writer whose name isn't and go them Pyre,

341
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.400
but perhaps the best way to explain the enduring appeal of HP Lovecraft is

342
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.550
through the words of Erica Henderson,
the marvel artist,

343
00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:24.900
responsible for squirrel girl speaking to the Guardian in 2013 she said,

344
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.490
love Croft made a world where humans are alone floating on a rock and a

345
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:34.280
terrifying larger universe that we cannot possibly comprehend because our time

346
00:20:34.281 --> 00:20:38.850
in this has been so short and we are so insignificant compared to the horrors

347
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.260
from the cathedral ethos.
So much of modern horror is based on that idea.

348
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.500
We wouldn't have Ghostbusters who went for Lovecraft's,

349
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.200
and that's the best arguments that I can think of for his work.

350
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.890
He may have been a widow,
he may have held despicable beliefs,

351
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.700
but Lovecraft was an artist who would come to influence the very way that we

352
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:00.340
think about horror from his twisted mind.

353
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.400
He brought us nightmares we'd never even dreamed of before.

354
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.030
Nice manners that still haunt us to this very day.

355
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.610
