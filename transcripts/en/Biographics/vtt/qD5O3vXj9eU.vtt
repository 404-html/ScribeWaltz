<v Speaker 1>He was the most influential thinker in world history,</v>

<v Speaker 1>surviving to our times.</v>

14

<v Speaker 1>His influence on both the western and the Islamic world has been profound in</v>

16
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>We discover the brilliance of Aristotle,</v>

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the details of Aristotle's life,</v>

18
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>a sketchy.</v>

19
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>We know that he was born in 384 BC in the Greek Macedonian town of stuck area on</v>

20
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>the north coast of the GMC.</v>

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>

22
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Nica Marcus was the quarter physician to the Macedonian King.</v>

23
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm an interest the seconds it is believed that Aristotle's mother faced us was</v>

24
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>descended from Greek aristocracy,</v>

25
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>the couple and three children with aristotle being the youngest.</v>

26
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He had assistant named Aaron Nestor and a brother named Ron Ness stores and they</v>

27
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>come back has died when aristotle was only 13.</v>

28
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>His mother died soon after and he was raised through his teenage years by his</v>

29
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>older sister's husband,</v>

30
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>proximus by the age of 17 aristotle.</v>

31
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>He was sent to Athens to pursue higher education.</v>

32
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>They are enrolled at Plato's academy.</v>

33
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Plato was the most renowned thinker of the time who himself had been taught by</v>

34
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>the great socrates.</v>

35
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>The academy had been found 20 years earlier and was situated beside an olive</v>

36
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>grove outside of the city walls rather than a formal school with a set</v>

37
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>curriculum and to clear delineation between teacher and students.</v>

38
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>The academy provided an informal setting whether master plato was pose problems</v>

39
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>to be pondered by his students.</v>

40
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Instead of listening to lectures,</v>

41
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>the students were encouraged to engage in dialectic discussion in order to</v>

42
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>establish a truth by means of reasoned argument.</v>

43
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>The main subjects under discussion,</v>

44
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>well philosophy,</v>

45
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 1>mathematics and destroy enemy.</v>

46
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle studied at the Academy for 20 years,</v>

47
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>advancing from students to teach teacher during this time.</v>

48
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:26.210
<v Speaker 1>He developed a great respect and a close friendship with Plato,</v>

49
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>the two men,</v>

50
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.261
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

51
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 1>they did have some fundamental philosophical differences.</v>

52
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.461
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

53
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 1>when Plato died in 347 bce,</v>

54
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.271
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>

55
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>his most brilliant students was not offered the directorship of the academy.</v>

56
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>That privilege instead went to Plato's nephews abusive post.</v>

57
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

58
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle left the academy apparently unhappy with the direction that it was</v>

59
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:48.770
<v Speaker 1>taking.</v>

60
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It is also possible that he was keen to get out of Athens as a result of the</v>

61
00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.520
<v Speaker 1>tide of anti Macedonian send them and in the city,</v>

62
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Iris does a little hand by this time,</v>

63
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:07.490
<v Speaker 1>developed some important friendships which would pave the way forward for him.</v>

64
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.810
<v Speaker 1>One of them was hmi as king of the Greek city of tenures in Asia Minor.</v>

65
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.420
<v Speaker 1>How many us was a former students at Plato's academy.</v>

66
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Upon hearing of the master's death,</v>

67
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:18.980
<v Speaker 1>he invited aristotle to come to our tennis irs,</v>

68
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.420
<v Speaker 1>sessionals and assets.</v>

69
00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The city which faced the island of lesbos that he became the head of a group of</v>

70
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>philosophers establishing a brand new academy.</v>

71
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.020
<v Speaker 1>His focus there was only the observation of the natural world.</v>

72
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.280
<v Speaker 1>He also begins to work on two volumes dealing with politics and kingship.</v>

73
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.600
<v Speaker 1>During his time in Asshole,</v>

74
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Sandra social met,</v>

75
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.340
<v Speaker 1>fell in love with and married the niece of Hmi is named five theists,</v>

76
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.190
<v Speaker 1>soon adult who was born who was also named five years.</v>

77
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Soon,</v>

78
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.170
<v Speaker 1>officer us was attacked by the Persians and gang.</v>

79
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Homies was taken captive and executed.</v>

80
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Iris doesn't lend his family.</v>

81
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:53.540
<v Speaker 1>They relocated to the island of Lesbos where they spent the next two years.</v>

82
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It was here that he indulged in his passion for the study of marine life.</v>

83
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.910
<v Speaker 1>The work the terrorists were conducted on the islands gave rise to a whole new</v>

84
00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>scientific discipline,</v>

85
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.093
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

86
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.090
<v Speaker 1>the study of life.</v>

87
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He was relentlessly systematic in his classifications.</v>

88
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Creatures they were divided into laundry grieves according to their</v>

89
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:11.900
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>

90
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.740
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in the publication of three books that minute detail of the</v>

91
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:17.600
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of living things.</v>

92
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.540
<v Speaker 1>He also studied the ecology of the islands</v>

93
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>in 343 BC.</v>

94
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Iris also received an invitation from Philip.</v>

95
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 1>The second is the king of massive dome to come and tutor his son,</v>

96
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Alexander,</v>

97
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>who was 13 at the time.</v>

98
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I accepted and moved his family to Macedonia where he became the director of the</v>

99
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Royal Academy.</v>

100
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 1>King Philip had a reputation as an uncouth and uneducated barbarian warrior.</v>

101
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 1>He was proud of his son,</v>

102
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 1>was developing the same strength of resolve and wanted the prince to balance his</v>

103
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 1>strength with knowledge and with wisdom,</v>

104
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>and he feared that the instruction that was being provided by the boys too.</v>

105
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It is when you create another version of himself.</v>

106
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 1>It was these concerns that prompted the king to call for the great teacher,</v>

107
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle or the academy.</v>

108
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle taught Alexander and other young members of the royal household and a</v>

109
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>style reminiscence of the platonic academy.</v>

110
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 1>He instructed them in morality,</v>

111
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.461
<v Speaker 1>in logic,</v>

112
00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 1>as well as the arts and medicine.</v>

113
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.561
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

114
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:22.760
<v Speaker 1>one on one lessons were given to Alexander the only was impetuous and stub and</v>

115
00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 1>often challenging and resisting as teacher.</v>

116
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.701
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

117
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 1>aristotle exhibited a great patient,</v>

118
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.860
<v Speaker 1>says he shaped and molded the thinking of the future,</v>

119
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.050
<v Speaker 1>conquer his superior reasoning,</v>

120
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 1>inevitably one over the prince.</v>

121
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.450
<v Speaker 1>One of Aristotle's greatest challenges was to reign in Alexander's impetuous</v>

122
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.930
<v Speaker 1>nature in one memorable exchange and also the prince.</v>

123
00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:45.770
<v Speaker 1>What the most valuable virtue was that a soldier could possess.</v>

124
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Alexandra immediately replied that it was courage,</v>

125
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but what aristotle last would happen if the war he has excess courage,</v>

126
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 1>cost and to run ahead of his army and face the enemy all alone.</v>

127
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Alexander acknowledge that he would surely be killed.</v>

128
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.370
<v Speaker 1>What though the teacher asked what happened,</v>

129
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.220
<v Speaker 1>and if a lack of courage cause the soldier to run the other direction,</v>

130
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>well then he would be a coward.</v>

131
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.961
<v Speaker 1>Came on exam,</v>

132
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>just reply by this exchange.</v>

133
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle taught Alexander the importance of always finding the middle pines and</v>

134
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>therefore developing balance in one's life.</v>

135
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle also educated Alexander in the warrior hero traditions of the past.</v>

136
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>He provided the teenager with a copy of the Iliad and is encouraged in the</v>

137
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>opponent assuming rulerships conquer the barbarian lands to the East Aristotle</v>

138
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>House,</v>

139
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>very ethnocentric view of non Greeks,</v>

140
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>which he doubtedly passed onto his people.</v>

141
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>He viewed them as fits only for slavery.</v>

142
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Ends famously gave this piece of advice to the future and be a leader to the</v>

143
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Greeks,</v>

144
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and they dispatched to the barbarians to look after the former as friends and</v>

145
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>relatives and to deal with the latter.</v>

146
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>As with beasts or plants,</v>

147
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Iris Delta was able to cultivate in the teenage prints a love of reading and of</v>

148
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>learning for the rest of his life.</v>

149
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Alexander remains an avid reader developing a special love for the writings of</v>

150
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>homer.</v>

151
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It is claimed the Eland,</v>

152
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.860
<v Speaker 1>all 15,693 lines of poetry in the Eliana by heart.</v>

153
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>The princes education at the ends of the great philosopher.</v>

154
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It came to an abrupt halt in 340 BC.</v>

155
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Alexander was the 16 year old out of the throne and he was called to Pella to</v>

156
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>rule over Macedonia while his father was off waging war</v>

157
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>by 335 BC,</v>

158
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Alexander and succeeded his father as king one visit.</v>

159
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:34.810
<v Speaker 1>First acts was to conquer Athens,</v>

160
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>which paved the way for our results are returned to the city where he had spent</v>

161
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:39.790
<v Speaker 1>his formative years,</v>

162
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Plato's academy,</v>

163
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>which was now run by a former student names and socrates was still the leading</v>

164
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:46.510
<v Speaker 1>influence on Greek thinking.</v>

165
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.961
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

166
00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:51.790
<v Speaker 1>aristotle was given permission by Alexandra to start up his own rival academy.</v>

167
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.571
<v Speaker 1>As a foreigner,</v>

168
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.600
<v Speaker 1>aristotle was not able to own property in Athens.</v>

169
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.261
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

170
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:58.360
<v Speaker 1>he rented a building called the Lyceum,</v>

171
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 1>which was a former wrestling school and outside of the city.</v>

172
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Unlike Plato's academy,</v>

173
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:06.670
<v Speaker 1>the Lyceum was not a private club for half of the day are still some tutors</v>

174
00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:09.550
<v Speaker 1>which teach that Peng students in advanced topics.</v>

175
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Then the doors would be opened and the lectures and discussion would be free of</v>

176
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:13.631
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>

177
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>It's open to anyone who wish to attend narrow,</v>

178
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.580
<v Speaker 1>soulful spent the bulk of the remainder of his life.</v>

179
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Working at the Lyceum,</v>

180
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 1>he develops a unique style teaching his students while they wandered around the</v>

181
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 1>gardens of the school.</v>

182
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.580
<v Speaker 1>This gave rise to the nickname peripatetics,</v>

183
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.290
<v Speaker 1>meaning people who wonder about this guy of study at the lyceum was vast.</v>

184
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle wanted his students to research and write about every area of human</v>

185
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:38.680
<v Speaker 1>thought from mathematics to biology,</v>

186
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.221
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

187
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:39.881
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

188
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:40.714
<v Speaker 1>and the rhetoric.</v>

189
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Students were required to write their arguments down in manuscript form.</v>

190
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>These were collected in the lyceums library,</v>

191
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:50.530
<v Speaker 1>which became one of the first great collections of historical writings,</v>

192
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.860
<v Speaker 1>and sometime during the first few years after his return to Athens,</v>

193
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle's wife Pythius,</v>

194
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>she died.</v>

195
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It is believed that the Persian king upsets the terrorists.</v>

196
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Delta has helped to arrange and aligns with Macedonia.</v>

197
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Had pythius arrest is then executed.</v>

198
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.983
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle.</v>

199
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He was heartbreaking in his grief.</v>

200
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>He read the poem of his life that survived,</v>

201
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>which he titled an Ode to Virtue in science,</v>

202
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>though Aristotle,</v>

203
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 1>he became romantically involved with a woman named her phyllis.</v>

204
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Some accounts states that,</v>

205
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>phyllis was a slave who had been given to aristotle by the court of Alexander,</v>

207
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but this cannot be verified.</v>

208
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>The two never married,</v>

209
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but I fill this bore aristotle,</v>

210
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:27.331
<v Speaker 1>many children,</v>

211
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>the first of whom they named Nick and MCASS after aristotle's father have</v>

212
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 1>phyllis remains with aristotle until his death.</v>

213
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.320
<v Speaker 1>During the years that our stuff was established as lyceum metathesis,</v>

214
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:38.971
<v Speaker 1>former people,</v>

215
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Alexander was very busy conquering the known world as his power grew,</v>

216
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>so did his ego,</v>

217
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.370
<v Speaker 1>the veggies that the philosopher has instilled in him with cost aside as he</v>

218
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:49.340
<v Speaker 1>became increasingly megalomaniacal.</v>

219
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Eventually he proclaimed himself to be divine and requires that all peoples</v>

220
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:58.890
<v Speaker 1>prostrate themselves before him in all of his status as a living going on</v>

221
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>aristotle's recommendation,</v>

222
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 1>his nephew Callis,</v>

223
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 1>the knees had been appointed as an office,</v>

224
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>a story of Alexander's Asiatic expedition.</v>

225
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians was concerned about the kings out of control,</v>

226
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:14.301
<v Speaker 1>ego and somewhat foolishly let his concerns be known and well this led to his</v>

227
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>execution.</v>

228
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Then in 323 BC,</v>

229
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>the 32 year old Alexander and he suddenly died soon thereafter,</v>

230
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:22.830
<v Speaker 1>the pro Macedonian governments.</v>

231
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 1>It was forcibly removed.</v>

232
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>The Athenians web now back in control into backlash was unleashed against the</v>

233
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Macedonians.</v>

234
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle is the leading Macedonian intellect and supporter of Alexander was a</v>

235
00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:44.570
<v Speaker 1>prime target of the new regime and he was formally charged with impiety or not</v>

236
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:46.490
<v Speaker 1>believing in the gods of the state.</v>

237
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.510
<v Speaker 1>This was the same charge that had been leveled at socrates and it led to his</v>

238
00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>conviction and his execution,</v>

239
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.120
<v Speaker 1>stating that he refused to allow Athens do sin against philosophy twice.</v>

240
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle decided not to stay and defend himself.</v>

241
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.960
<v Speaker 1>He fled the city and headed for the islands of your beer where his mother's</v>

242
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:04.040
<v Speaker 1>estate was located.</v>

243
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.730
<v Speaker 1>He died on the islands in 323 BC.</v>

244
00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:07.760
<v Speaker 1>You have natural causes.</v>

245
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It was 62 years of age.</v>

246
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.071
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

247
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 1>normally this is where a graphics video would end,</v>

248
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but there is much more about aristotle to come,</v>

249
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but first I do want to thank today's sponsor,</v>

250
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:19.880
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and I know ads in the middle of the video.</v>

251
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 1>They aren't great that sponsors like brilliant do make these longer videos,</v>

252
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>possible brilliance or assigns learning platform that allow you to learn through</v>

253
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.890
<v Speaker 1>active learning,</v>

254
00:11:27.891 --> 00:11:31.430
<v Speaker 1>which summed up is basically the opposite of that feeling of reading a complex</v>

255
00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 1>paragraph about some principle and then just having absolutely no clue about</v>

256
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.100
<v Speaker 1>what they were going on about,</v>

257
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.690
<v Speaker 1>even though you read it 10 times,</v>

259
00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:41.270
<v Speaker 1>still got no idea what's happening and brilliant.</v>

260
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't just cover the basics or they totally covered those as well.</v>

261
00:11:44.301 --> 00:11:48.380
<v Speaker 1>They go all the way through to really complex things like advanced statistics,</v>

262
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.891
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

263
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 1>makes even complex statistical concepts,</v>

264
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:52.340
<v Speaker 1>very easy to understand,</v>

265
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but they're giving you something super short to read.</v>

266
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:54.911
<v Speaker 1>It's easy,</v>

267
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and then you've immediately apply what you just read to a problem and rinse and</v>

268
00:11:58.901 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>repeat and boom.</v>

269
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly you understand stuff that you didn't really think it ever be able to</v>

270
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

271
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I've used brilliant to do just this.</v>

272
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing how quickly you grasped such complex subjects.</v>

273
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>You can spoil biographics by going to brilliant.org,</v>

274
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 1>forward slash buyer graphics,</v>

275
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and now let's get back to aristotle.</v>

276
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

277
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle had died as an enemy of the state and so memory of him,</v>

278
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it was discouraged.</v>

279
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

280
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>his students and friend Theophrastus kept says,</v>

281
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>writing secretly hidden while also taking the reins of the lyceum.</v>

282
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>The works of Aristotle did not see the light of day until the beginning of the</v>

283
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:41.440
<v Speaker 1>first century BC when they became appreciated throughout the Roman world.</v>

284
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.520
<v Speaker 1>After the fall of Rome,</v>

285
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 1>aristotle became familiar to the Islamic world as well,</v>

286
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 1>where many thinkers,</v>

287
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 1>if the time came to appreciate,</v>

288
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 1>is logical deductive methodology.</v>

289
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.161
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

290
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 1>it was largely because of his popularity and the Byzantium worlds that</v>

291
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>aristotle's teachings were able to survive the dark ages.</v>

292
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 1>It was during the 13th century.</v>

293
00:12:58.751 --> 00:12:59.471
<v Speaker 1>See this,</v>

294
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 1>aristotle was reintroduced to the west.</v>

295
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>This was achieved primarily through the work of Thomas Aquinas,</v>

296
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>who attempted to amalgamate religious beliefs with science and philosophy.</v>

297
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Aquinas incorporated Aristotle's assertion that a wrath lies at the center of</v>

298
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 1>the universe as a fundamental tenets of Catholicism.</v>

299
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 1>During the renascence and reformation years,</v>

300
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>a succession of religious reformers and scientists began to question some</v>

301
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.051
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>

302
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 1>he and beliefs that had been absorbed into the Catholic church.</v>

303
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.030
<v Speaker 1>One of them was the Italian astronomer,</v>

304
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Galileo,</v>

305
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.021
<v Speaker 1>Galileo,</v>

306
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 1>who presented observational proof that the earth orbiting the sun.</v>

307
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's ironic that while aristotle was undoubtedly have embraced this new</v>

308
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 1>observation the Catholic church fathers made,</v>

309
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Galileo appeared before the inquisition and recant a session.</v>

310
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 1>English physicist William Harvey later discovered that internal organs don't</v>

311
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:49.000
<v Speaker 1>work the way that aristotle had status.</v>

312
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Another of Aristotle's views that was disproved was that decay only happens on</v>

313
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the Earth while the heavens never change.</v>

314
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Nineteenth Century astronomists Lord Calvin challenged this notion with the</v>

315
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 1>concept of entropy,</v>

316
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.120
<v Speaker 1>which states that all matter,</v>

317
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 1>whether earthly or heavenly,</v>

318
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.260
<v Speaker 1>will eventually decay.</v>

319
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle also told the planets and stars are all encased in crystalline</v>

320
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.331
<v Speaker 1>spheres.</v>

321
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:15.331
<v Speaker 1>Each one nested inside the next with the earth being the intimate sphere by the</v>

322
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>18th century.</v>

323
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>The contradictory idea that the planets hang on a void was gaining acceptance.</v>

324
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle wrote some 10 million words in order to preserve his thoughts.</v>

325
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.861
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

326
00:14:31.861 --> 00:14:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the majority of them have not survived the passing of the years.</v>

327
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.210
<v Speaker 1>The manuscripts were been covered in the first century BC when they were edited</v>

328
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:41.040
<v Speaker 1>by a man named Andronicus.</v>

329
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.150
<v Speaker 1>The works that we have today are derived from Andronico's as edited versions,</v>

330
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:48.090
<v Speaker 1>and so we're not directly prepared for publication by Aristotle.</v>

331
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

332
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>we are able to read about a million of Aristotle's which represents some 20</v>

333
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:57.740
<v Speaker 1>percent of his total work as a result of the paucity of writings that we have,</v>

334
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 1>we are only able to see a shadow of the brilliance of aristotle.</v>

335
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.500
<v Speaker 1>The quality of the pros,</v>

336
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 1>which has been lost to us,</v>

337
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>was hinted dance by Roman statesmen Cicero.</v>

338
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>He went declaring aristotle's ratings to those of Plato declared.</v>

339
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>If Plato pros with silver,</v>

340
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 1>aristotle's was a flowing river of gold.</v>

341
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>The works of Aristotle that have survived are grouped into four categories.</v>

342
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 1>First is the organization in which quantify a set of logical principles to</v>

343
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:28.031
<v Speaker 1>follow when conducting an investigation then comes the theoretical consisting of</v>

344
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 1>a range of treatises on the natural world.</v>

345
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 1>The practical mechanic refocuses,</v>

346
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>focuses on achieving excellence within the individual,</v>

347
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.661
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

348
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>and in society.</v>

349
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:37.131
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

350
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the rhetoric writing collect together,</v>

351
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:40.501
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>

352
00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 1>surviving political and philosophical speeches.</v>

353
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle divided the sciences into three categories.</v>

354
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 1>The productive,</v>

355
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 1>the practical and the theoretical productive sciences encompasses such things as</v>

356
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>building an architecture,</v>

357
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 1>but also battlefield strategy in courtroom tactics.</v>

358
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>There's also practical sciences which cover ethics and guided behavior.</v>

359
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 1>The theoretical sciences,</v>

360
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 1>which included mathematics and physics and full of the quest for knowledge and</v>

361
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 1>understanding is that own end results,</v>

362
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 1>the scope of Aristotle's scientific research.</v>

363
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.140
<v Speaker 1>It was staggering.</v>

364
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 1>His writings feature minute descriptions of more than 500 species,</v>

365
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.630
<v Speaker 1>some of the features that he observed.</v>

366
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 1>We're not verified until the invention of the microscope.</v>

367
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of years later,</v>

368
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 1>his detailed observations included the Anatomy Dot,</v>

369
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>habitat and reproductive system of the fish,</v>

370
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:30.591
<v Speaker 1>insects,</v>

371
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:32.210
<v Speaker 1>and animals that he observed.</v>

372
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>While on the island of Lesbos.</v>

373
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 1>A trademark of Aristotle's thinking was that evidence was the ultimate arbiter</v>

374
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 1>of truth.</v>

375
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of what theories you may hold.</v>

376
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:42.860
<v Speaker 1>If observation proved them wrong,</v>

377
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>

378
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 1>must have the humility to discard them and go with the evidence.</v>

379
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Despite being challenged with impiety aristotle,</v>

380
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.470
<v Speaker 1>he did believe in God.</v>

381
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.100
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

382
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 1>his God did not create or control the universe but could affect it.</v>

383
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.870
<v Speaker 1>He viewed God as the ultimate abstract reason.</v>

384
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I considered that the highest level of attainment for a human is to as closely</v>

385
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:10.270
<v Speaker 1>emulate God's ability to reason abstractly as possible so the person could get</v>

386
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:14.990
<v Speaker 1>to this heightened ability to reason the closer they would be to God himself.</v>

387
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle's greatest contribution to mankind was that he provided a methodology</v>

388
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>by which to find solutions to problems rather than providing the solutions</v>

389
00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

390
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 1>When he did come to conclusions,</v>

391
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>he was careful to qualify it by stating that the conclusion was based upon the</v>

392
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.160
<v Speaker 1>evidence available at the time.</v>

393
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.000
<v Speaker 1>If new evidence was to come to live so that proved his conclusions wrong,</v>

394
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>then he would discount them.</v>

395
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

396
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.370
<v Speaker 1>during the period known as the Christian Middle Ages between 476 and 1,453 ce,</v>

397
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle's methodology was cast aside and the focus went squarely on his</v>

398
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>conclusions,</v>

399
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:53.820
<v Speaker 1>which contrary to his wishes were accepted without question.</v>

400
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 1>So rather than observing nature to find the answers,</v>

401
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 1>they simply accepted what aristotle had written on the subject.</v>

402
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Plato and Aristotle ended up with very different philosophical approaches.</v>

403
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Plato was the ultimate idealist,</v>

404
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but leaving the world around us is merely a collection of ideas.</v>

405
00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.371
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

406
00:18:15.371 --> 00:18:19.990
<v Speaker 1>aristotle was a realist to believe that the only reality was the physical world</v>

407
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:21.010
<v Speaker 1>which we inhabit.</v>

408
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Each man would provide a work of political philosophy.</v>

409
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.581
<v Speaker 1>In Plato's case,</v>

410
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:25.900
<v Speaker 1>it was entitled the Republic,</v>

411
00:18:25.901 --> 00:18:27.040
<v Speaker 1>while Aristotle called.</v>

412
00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Here's the politic.</v>

413
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Plato's work was focused on achieving the ideal state.</v>

414
00:18:31.181 --> 00:18:35.680
<v Speaker 1>He believed that one way to achieve this was through the eradication of private</v>

415
00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.340
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

416
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.170
<v Speaker 1>the family and gender roles.</v>

417
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.210
<v Speaker 1>By doing away with these societal norms play,</v>

418
00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Jay was hoping to transcend human selfishness in order to achieve social unity.</v>

419
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.431
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle,</v>

420
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:46.660
<v Speaker 1>however rejects it,</v>

421
00:18:46.661 --> 00:18:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the end goal of Plato's ideal state,</v>

422
00:18:48.941 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 1>he contended that selfishness is a part of human nature.</v>

423
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.210
<v Speaker 1>His idea was to design a government that acknowledged human selfishness and it's</v>

424
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.600
<v Speaker 1>putting in place checks and balances to mitigate it.</v>

425
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.160
<v Speaker 1>He pointed out the impracticality of Plato's views asking such questions as who</v>

426
00:19:03.161 --> 00:19:05.710
<v Speaker 1>would look after the children if they weren't part of a family.</v>

427
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.460
<v Speaker 1>If other contended that human selfishness is one of the driving forces that</v>

428
00:19:09.461 --> 00:19:10.750
<v Speaker 1>results in achievement.</v>

429
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle devised a working government he referred to as policy and it was</v>

430
00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.940
<v Speaker 1>balanced between the rich and the poor with neither one dominating the other</v>

431
00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:19.240
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

432
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.050
<v Speaker 1>People were forced to work together for the overall good of society while</v>

433
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.580
<v Speaker 1>retaining their property rights.</v>

434
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the hallmarks of aristotle's method of arguments was logical developments</v>

435
00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:30.580
<v Speaker 1>where each point builds upon the last.</v>

436
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.080
<v Speaker 1>This was very different to plato who would jump all over the place with his</v>

437
00:19:35.081 --> 00:19:35.740
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

438
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.431
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>

439
00:19:36.431 --> 00:19:40.690
<v Speaker 1>aristotle emphasize the need for mental discipline by which those engaged in</v>

440
00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 1>debate would stay focused on the topic at hand plays.</v>

441
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I was mainly concerned with the accumulation of knowledge.</v>

442
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.050
<v Speaker 1>He believed that ideas were subjective and could be influenced by personal</v>

443
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:50.590
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>

444
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle on the other hand was focused on observation and the examination of</v>

445
00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:55.600
<v Speaker 1>what is real.</v>

446
00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.040
<v Speaker 1>He was an objective thinker who did not allow a place for emotion or personal</v>

447
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:00.851
<v Speaker 1>opinion play,</v>

448
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:02.320
<v Speaker 1>so was an idea list.</v>

449
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.951
<v Speaker 1>He believed,</v>

450
00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:03.581
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

451
00:20:03.581 --> 00:20:06.040
<v Speaker 1>but knowing good was enough for a person to do God.</v>

452
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:06.911
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle,</v>

453
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:07.301
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

454
00:20:07.301 --> 00:20:09.310
<v Speaker 1>argued that knowing good was not good enough,</v>

455
00:20:09.311 --> 00:20:14.311
<v Speaker 1>a person had to practice being good to benefit himself as well as society plays.</v>

456
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.080
<v Speaker 1>They also believed that every concept has an ideal form,</v>

457
00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:21.370
<v Speaker 1>whereas aristotle was a view that every concept and needed to be studied on an</v>

458
00:20:21.371 --> 00:20:23.920
<v Speaker 1>individual level in order to understand it.</v>

459
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Plato was of the view that reasoning and thought experiments were sufficient to</v>

460
00:20:27.591 --> 00:20:28.241
<v Speaker 1>prove matters.</v>

461
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Aristotle relies upon direct experience as a results of their differing</v>

462
00:20:33.221 --> 00:20:33.760
<v Speaker 1>approaches.</v>

463
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.700
<v Speaker 1>The scientific contributions of aristotle were much greater than those of us</v>

464
00:20:37.701 --> 00:20:38.534
<v Speaker 1>teacher Plato.</v>

465
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.530
<v Speaker 1>The lastest teachings were predominantly theoretical,</v>

466
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.880
<v Speaker 1>lacking practicality,</v>

467
00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.230
<v Speaker 1>whereas aristotle,</v>

468
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.320
<v Speaker 1>he's left us with the scientific method which grounded in practical observation.</v>

469
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 1>So I really hope you found this video interesting.</v>
