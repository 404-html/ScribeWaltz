1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.560
Just the mention of his name can send a chill up the spine in a place full of

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.410
horror.
He was the most feared monster of the mall.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.470
We're of course talking about the angel of death,
Josef Mengele,

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.900
although trained as a doctor to preserve life,

5
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:17.220
he brought a sadistic cruelty to the experiments that ended the lives of so many

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.190
and as victims of choice when they were children.
And this week's biographics,

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.750
we reveal the to pray of life of the monster of Auschwitz.

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.480
Doctor Yosef Mangola

9
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.410
yes of Mengele entered the welds on the 16th of March,

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.070
1911 and the German Bavarian town of Greensburg after three miscarriages.

11
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.970
He was the first born of coal as well purge and Mengele color was the owner of a

12
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:50.760
farm machine factory,
which tend to producing munitions.

13
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:55.020
When war broke out in 1914 the Manga lawyers would go on to have two more sons,

14
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.020
but Joseph was the firm favorite of his mother.

15
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.790
While Pogo was an obese woman who had a stern reputation and a voracious

16
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:03.510
appetite.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930
She doted on her eldest son and was much closer to him than she wants to.

18
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.250
Our husbands for his pass.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.480
Yossef proved to be a quiet child whose main goal was to pleased as overbearing

20
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.180
mother at school Yosef.

21
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.580
He was an average students be struggled to keep his grades up at the standard

22
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.720
that is mother expect us and it's when he was 15 he contracted the serious bone

23
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:26.070
marrow disease osteomyelitis.
The disease which was often fatal in those days,

24
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.860
kept him off school for six months resenting to class.

25
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.610
He was seriously behind his peers academically over the next two years,

26
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:37.410
he showed a remarkable level of self discipline to not only catch up but surpass

27
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.790
many of his fellow students.

28
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.080
By the age of 17 he had outgrown his shyness and developed into a handsome

29
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.430
focused and driven young man who was popular with both teachers and classmates.

30
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.760
In April,

31
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.270
1930 the 19 year old passed his high school exams and gained acceptance into the

32
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.510
medical and philosophy faculties at Munich University.

33
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.360
He had decided to become a doctor.

34
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.390
Mengele stood out from the other men on campus.

35
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.350
He was always impeccably dressed and had developed the bear of a gentlemen,

36
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.860
be treated women with old fashioned dignity and was a very good dancer.

37
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.640
All these streets has got him quickly noticed by the ladies with the results

38
00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:20.160
that is social calendar was usually pretty full.

39
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.900
During his first year of university,
Manga began to show an interest in politics.

40
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
He joins the steel helmets in March of 1931 a paramilitary group who advocated a

41
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.860
return to the prewar monarchy.

42
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.870
The steel helmets were a stepping stone and the national socialist or Nazi
party,

43
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.070
which was promoted in beer halls as well as on university campuses.

44
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.910
Then Nancy advocated a return of German pride and pure innocence,

45
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.210
the removal of racial impurities.
These ideas,

46
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.560
they appealed to Mengele and it seemed to Mesh with the social Darwinism that he

47
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.420
thought was being taught in the lecture halls.

48
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.820
He became fascinated with eugenics,

49
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.640
particularly the idea that the population could made more perfect through

50
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.780
selective breeding of those who had the most desirable characteristics.

51
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.580
It would also help to weed out undesirable traits by the elimination of the weak

52
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.540
and the feeble.
Hmm.

53
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.150
While the Nazis believed in Eugenics for them,

54
00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:21.990
the process of generational selective breeding,
it was too slow.

55
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.410
They were determined to weed out the weak.
Right now,

56
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.850
the Aryan race could simply no longer stands being contaminated by inferior

57
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:32.190
races such as the Slavs and the Jews,

58
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.430
both of whom were considered into men's sure subhuman.

59
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.930
These beliefs were enthusiastically embraced by the young and impressionable

60
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:44.490
Josef Mengele.
In 1935 Mengele was awarded a phd in anthropology.

61
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.470
His thesis was entitled Racial Morphological Research on the lower jaw section

62
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.150
of for racial groups.

63
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.140
The people was free of any racial bias and set out to prove empirically by

64
00:03:55.141 --> 00:04:00.120
science alone that the German was of superior breeding and about a human being.

65
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.880
Yeah.
Later man.
Hello.
Graduated with a medical degree.

66
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.570
He's been four months as an intern at Leipzig University clinic before joining

67
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:10.890
the staff of Germany's leading racial experts.
This was doctor Omar free,

68
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:11.900
her von [inaudible],

69
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.740
and he was based at the Institute for heredity biology and racial purity located

70
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.750
at the University of Frankfurt.
Mangle.

71
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:22.470
His job at the institute was to examine people who are suspected of breaking the

72
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.350
Nuremberg laws to see whether or not they were Jews.

73
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.710
He and his colleagues created thousands of files which would turn out to be

74
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:33.000
devastating in future years when people were rounded up for transportation to

75
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:37.710
concentration camps.
In May of 1937 Mengele officially joined the Nazi party.

76
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.330
He became a member of the Nazi Doctors Party and then in May of 1938 the short

77
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.250
staffing or assets,
the assets had been created as his personal protection squad,

78
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.640
but it expanded its role to the running of concentration camps.

79
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.710
The leader of the SS was Heinrich Himmler,

80
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.910
a meticulous organizer who had plans to make these still small organization as

81
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:59.330
powerful as the national army.
At the time,

82
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.990
Mengele joined the SS was an elite group,

83
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.180
but only allows the best specimens of area and manhood into its racks.

84
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.233
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.160
<v 0>At about the same time as he became a member of the ss man.</v>

86
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.190
Hello became engaged to Irene showing by the daughter of a professor at

87
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.120
Frankfurt University six years younger than Joseph.

88
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.030
Irene was a blond haired beauty and made deep perfect compliments to the

89
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.020
handsome athletic looking young docs up when it came to getting married.
However,

90
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.130
that was a bit of a problem.

91
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.520
While Yosef was able to show documentation of his area and purity,

92
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.290
Irene could not prove that her grandfather was 100% area.

93
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.590
It was only the influence of the Mengele family that it smoothed the way for the

94
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:41.980
wedding,

95
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.980
which took place in July of 1939 the failure to fully prove I reads ancestry

96
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.220
precluded the main from inclusion in the kinship book of the SS,

97
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.510
which included couples.

98
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.320
You could prove that area in ancestry back to 1715 as a result of Mengele was

99
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:59.420
deprived of the swords and spoons ward,

100
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.570
which was given to an ss man on the birth of a child.

101
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.130
After just three months of marriage,

102
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.530
Mangalo was cooled for a three month stint in the army.

103
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.340
He was sent to the tyrolean mountain region possessing a high level of physical

104
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.200
fitness and being an adapt Hika.

105
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.500
He excels in his service having completed his three months service.

106
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:17.570
He returned to his job at Frankfurt University,

107
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.490
but with the coming of war in 1939 national mobilization was instituted.

108
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.150
Mangola was rejected on the first draft because he had had a kidney infection.

109
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.984
It's a child

110
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.630
in June of 1948 main hello.

111
00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:37.740
It was finally calls up becoming a second leftenant in the Waffen ss.

112
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.820
He was putting into no combat position working in the logical section of the

113
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:43.200
race and resettlement office.

114
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.650
By June of 1941 with the onset of Operation Barbarossa,

115
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.010
there was an urgent need for men to serve on the eastern front.

116
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.190
Mengele was pulled out of the office and sent to the Russian France.

117
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.520
He proved to be a courageous soldier winning the Iron Cross.

118
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.870
Second class at the beginning of 1942 Mengele transferred to the Scandinavian

119
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:04.440
Viking ss division where he served as a field doctor.
Again,

120
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.040
he proved his courage under fire winning the iron cross first class when he

121
00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:12.150
pulled two men from a burning tank in November of 1942 he suffered serious

122
00:07:12.151 --> 00:07:15.420
wounds and was taken off the front lines.
After a period of recovery,

123
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.940
he returned to do the race and reassessment office.

124
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.200
He gains a promotion to captain and then in mid 1943 was given what was to him a

125
00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:23.010
dream job.

126
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.690
This was a practical eugenics research at this man that he was able to indulge

127
00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:29.760
all of the wackiest eugenics theories,

128
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.210
testing them out on living human subjects.

129
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.413
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

130
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.680
<v 0>the human subjects who would be mangled as Guinea pigs,</v>

131
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.860
where to be found at the Auschwitz Birkenau concentration camp.

132
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.550
The obtains a posting to the camp and set about extending his anthropological

133
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:48.930
research into heredity.

134
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.860
Mengele was not the first doctor to use concentration camp inmates for research

135
00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:57.840
purposes and and volts and to cow Jews were injected with bacteria exposed to

136
00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:02.250
all manner of deadly diseases and struck with rifle butts repeatedly to see how

137
00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:06.150
long it would take for them to suffer irreversible brain damage at Auschwitz

138
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:06.631
itself.

139
00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:11.210
Dr Horst Schumann had been conducting sterilization experiments once castrating

140
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.520
19 men in a single day.
Yes.

141
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.060
Manolo was to take the scope and is barbarity of his experiments to an entirely

142
00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:18.840
new level.

143
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.620
Auschwitz had been elected as the venue for his work because of it's out of the

144
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:25.830
way location and because it was close to where railway junction with tracks

145
00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:29.940
coming from all over Europe.
Mangler arrived at Auschwitz on the 23rd of May,

146
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.110
1943 the next day he participated in his first selection.

147
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.770
This involved selecting which of the new inmates are rivals,
which to live in,

148
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:39.750
which were to die.
On that day alone,

149
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.780
he sent 1035 Gypsies to the gas chamber as it as his nature Manga was impeccably

150
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:49.290
dressed.
During these selections,
he wore a white as medical uniform,

151
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.020
white gloves and polished black boots.
His face was this,

152
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.490
as he decided who was to die by a flick of his wrist,

153
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.300
his constant chain smoking and it's era of nonchalance presented a mystifying.

154
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.330
Yes.
Terrifying sites for the bewildered new arrivals.

155
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.770
During his time at Auschwitz Mengele oversaw selection on 74 transports,

156
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.070
80% of new arrivals were condemned to death immediately.

157
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.560
All Children under the age of 14 were killed.

158
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.960
As with the old and the infirm Mengele.

159
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.350
It seemed to enjoy this aspect of his job and he was known to say,

160
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.040
here are the Jews enter through the doors and leave through the chimney.

161
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.250
Mangola his passion,
however,
was for scientific research.

162
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.750
He instructed the gods to seek out those who were deformed,
overly tall midgets,

163
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:33.750
or he were lame.
His most prized subjects were twins,

164
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.310
especially if they were children.

165
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.000
From his earliest days that university Mengele had a fascination with twins.

166
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.740
He believed that by studying them,

167
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.070
he could discover the secret to genetic manipulation.
Indeed,

168
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.180
it was his search for twins that motivated him to attend so many arrivals

169
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:49.210
selections.
During his time at Auschwitz,

170
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:54.180
he managed to find 1,500 pairs of twins that were used as human Guinea pigs.

171
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.010
Only 100 pounds survived.

172
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.070
The twins and other research subjects who were selected on arrival would be

173
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:02.640
marched to living quarters at the birth canal and about two miles away there.

174
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:06.270
They lived in appalling conditions surrounded by rotting corpses and starving

175
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:09.540
adults once established and they're disgraceful living quarters,

176
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.930
the children and had to complete an intensive questionnaire in which they have

177
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.650
to indicate their age,
height,
eye and hair color,
ethnic backgrounds,

178
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:17.940
as well as any health problems.

179
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.850
All the children assisted young ones to complete the forms,

180
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.510
desperate to have everything completed to the satisfaction of the gods.

181
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.470
Children would then be interviewed by Mangola himself who would take extensive

182
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.020
notes and then have a file for each child drawn up.

183
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.560
He was determined to have his research seen as legitimate and so we went to

184
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:38.880
great lengths to keep everything official in preparation for experimentation.

185
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:42.000
The children were cleaned,
bathed,
and dressed in clean pajamas.

186
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.960
They were then taken by Red Cross vehicles to one of has research laboratories.

187
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.740
He had established a number of labs around the Auschwitz Birkenau area for the

188
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:53.460
specific purposes.
At one blood tests and x rays were taken here.

189
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:57.090
The children were treated with Cat Mengele would come in regularly to make sure

190
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:59.220
that none were being mistreated.
On these occasions,

191
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:02.880
he would hand out sweets to the children and talk gently and reassuring the to

192
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.610
them.
By doing this,
he was able to engender trust,

193
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.460
which got the children onto this experimentation table

194
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.910
and other labs.
The most heinous barbarism was taking place on a daily basis.

195
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.800
Anesthesia,
it was never used,

196
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.460
so the pain that was inflicted on the children can hardly even be imagined.

197
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.850
Experiments included the removal of specific organs or limbs.

198
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.150
Immersion in freezing water,
the injection of dyes into the eyes,

199
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.880
the castration of boys,
sterilization of girls,

200
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.100
and deliberate infection of wounds with gangrene.

201
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.670
Occasionally Mangalo we'd organize endurance test experiments.

202
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.600
This involved subjects being given increasingly strong voltages of electricity

203
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.110
until they either died,
became unconscious or went into a coma.

204
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.430
As soon as the twin died,

205
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.060
it's sibling would immediately be killed in order to provide comparative data

206
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.390
during the autopsies display mangle his attempts to cloak his work in
legitimacy.

207
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.160
There was no valid scientific reason for any of these horrendous experiments.

208
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.940
Doctors who assisted Mengele later recorded that it seemed as if many of the

209
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.540
experiments were just inspired purely by sadism.

210
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.890
In addition to his diabolical lab work and to selection duties with new
arrivals,

211
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.140
Mangola occasionally delivered babies,

212
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.290
women who were found to be pregnant and were immediately gassed.
However,

213
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.460
if they were near full term,

214
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.790
Mangalo would deliver the baby only to be sent with its mother to death.

215
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.480
One of his greatest amusements was to allow for them both to live for some time

216
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.930
but to take the mother's breasts so that she would be forced to watch a baby

217
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.960
starve to death of all of his atrocities.

218
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.710
The worst occurred when he had a pit dug and a massive file it and the yard of

219
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.310
Birkenau.

220
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.600
He then had 300 children all under the age of five thrown into the flames.

221
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.520
Unlike the majority of Nazi killers,

222
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.360
Mengele did not have to be drugged or drunk in order to carry out his murderous

223
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:47.300
work.
In fact,

224
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:50.710
according to Jewish survivors who were forced to assist in the laboratories,

225
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.340
he was enthusiastic and it's infliction of cruelty.
At times,

226
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.670
his temper would flare and exhibit itself with sharp bursts of horror.

227
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.690
On one occasion,

228
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.530
he smashed an old man's skull open simply because he wanted to be on his son's

229
00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:05.320
work.
Detail within the camps of Auschwitz and Birkenau,

230
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.250
Mengele had unlimited power.
This combines with this natural sadism,

231
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.470
turns him into a monster.
He was often in the company.

232
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:15.940
It's on his rounds by his female equal ss Goddamn aggressor at 21 year old

233
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:18.700
blonde beauty,
who was almost as depraved as he was.

234
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.930
The two of them marched around the camp and immaculate uniform,
the perfect area,

235
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.380
and couple mangle his hatred for the Jews.
It knew no bounds.

236
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.790
He would celebrate Jewish holy days such as Yom Kippor by ordering the gassing

237
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:31.840
of a thousand children,

238
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.860
but as extreme prejudice could not prevent feelings of lust from arising within

239
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:39.280
him.
On occasion when naked young women were paraded in front of him.

240
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.211
On one occasion,

241
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:43.810
a beautiful 15 year old Jewish girl from Transylvania stood in front of him.

242
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.210
Mengele was clearly aroused by the girl,

243
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.470
obviously torn inside you and the girl selected for special experimentation over

244
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:51.160
the next hour.

245
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.510
He caused such deformity to our body that she resembles an old decrepit hag.

246
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.170
He then left her to die having overcome his illicit lust.

247
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.350
By early 1944 Mengele had taken to adopting a child in variably the little boy

248
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.900
would physically resemble him and we'd be dressed in a small white medical

249
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:10.060
uniform.
Mengele would walk around the camp,

250
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:12.790
hands in hands with a child providing him with suites and ties.

251
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.660
Within a month the doctor would tire of the child's and let him still hand in

252
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:18.160
hand to the gas chamber.

253
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.910
The crueler than Mengele was in the conducting of his duty is the more respect

254
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:23.440
he got in the Nazi hierarchy.

255
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.850
In a report written at the end of 1944 Auschwitz camp commandants Rudolph Hess,

256
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:30.160
right to that Mengele carried out all tasks,

257
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:34.390
evens him often under very difficult conditions to the complete satisfaction of

258
00:14:34.391 --> 00:14:35.224
his superiors.

259
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.910
Often using his little off duty time to utilize the scientific material that is

260
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:43.690
disposal to make valuable contributions.
You anthropological science.

261
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.990
By early 1945 Mengele was at the height of his power.
Yes.

262
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.050
You could also read the writing on the wall.

263
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.440
He knew that the war was seemed lost and that the Russians would overrun the

264
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:58.910
camp.
In early January,

265
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:02.330
the Crematoria had been blown up and healthy prisoners were being forced,

266
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:04.190
marched in new destinations in Germany,

267
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.980
and I got to let continued his experiments until the last minute,

268
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.710
but then he busied himself and shipping out all of his equipment,

269
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.060
documents and reports.

270
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.070
Then on January the 17th of 1945 Josef Mengele simply disappeared from
Auschwitz.

271
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.660
10 days later,
the Russians arrived.
They discovered a burnt out horror factory.

272
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.350
The place had been set on fire and the Germans like Mengele had flat,

273
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.960
a few thousand survivors more dead than alive.

274
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.940
We're fountains wandering among the ruins.

275
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.910
Mengele had flesh to another concentration camp further south.

276
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.290
Then as the Russians closed in on that camp,

277
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.090
he made for the math housing camp in Austria.
When the allies approached,

278
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.120
he ditched his Nazi uniform and went on the run.
It's freedom.

279
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.030
It didn't last long.

280
00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:44.860
On May the second he had joined up with a war hospital units.

281
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.470
The unit soon was overrun by the Russians and all the Germans were taken into

282
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:51.590
custody.
When arrested Mengele was wearing a we're marked uniform.

283
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.670
He proved to be about prisoner constantly worrying that he would be exposed as

284
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:59.330
an SS officer.
We've all,
if the suspected ss men we did out,

285
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.140
he and the other prisoners were handed over to the Americans and then released.

286
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.290
The Angel of death appeared to have escaped scottfree.
However,

287
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.540
he knew he would be constantly hunted down.

288
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.490
He was too afraid to return to his family,

289
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.930
so he traveled around West Germany and into Soviet occupied East Germany for

290
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:18.230
three years.
He worked as a laborer on an Alpine farm in Bavaria.

291
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:23.971
Meanwhile,

292
00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:27.330
the story of mangle his atrocities had been revealed to the world at large.

293
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:27.991
As a result,

294
00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:31.650
he became the most sought after Nazi scalped by postwar Nazi hunters.

295
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.470
He made the decision to flee Europe walking over the absence crossing into Italy

296
00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:39.600
in April of 1949 he then made his way to south Tyrol wearing managed to obtain

297
00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:42.920
an international Red Cross id card under a false name with sc.

298
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.400
Managed to get a Swiss passport,

299
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.110
then color then traveled to Genoa where he set sail for Buenos Aires,
Argentina.

300
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.710
Upon arriving on Argentinian soil,
Mengele finally felt safe.

301
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.140
He was taken in by Argentinean presidents.

302

304
00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:05.640
fleeing Nazi's.
Manga established a comfortable life in Argentina.

305
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.910
He found work as a carpenter,
a trades at which he proved to be adapt.

306
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.960
He was also a highly respected member of the local Nazi community by now.

307
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.110
His father was extremely wealthy as a result of his business ventures.

308
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.070
The old man financed international run Davies.
Usually it's skiing resorts.

309
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.310
Absent from these family get togethers was mangle.
His wife Irene,

310
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.820
who had divorced her husband in absent Teesha on a family skiing trip to

311
00:17:26.821 --> 00:17:31.080
Switzerland in 1956 man.
Hello,
charmed his dead brother calls widow Martha.

312
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.310
A year later,
they were married Martha Anderson.

313
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.260
Ralph moved to Argentina to be with Manga with the backing of his father's money

314
00:17:37.261 --> 00:17:39.600
Mengele and his new family.
They lived very well.

315
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.140
They moved into an upmarket villa and a luxurious suburb.
Ironically,

316
00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:45.510
in the midst of many wealthy Jewish families,

317
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.370
he felt so confident in his new life that in 1956 he gave up his and reverted to

318
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:51.840
his real name.
However,

319
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:55.170
a determined Hansville of Nazi hunters mainly made up of Holocaust.

320
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:57.180
Survivors were hot on his trail,

321
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.810
one of them harm and lang been managed to get ahold of the divorce papers filed

322
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:04.560
by Irene.
They indicated that men hello was living in Buenos Aires.

323
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.160
Lang been pressured the West German government to issue an arrest warrants,

324
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.180
which they did on June the seventh 1959 the West German foreign ministry now

325
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.420
demanded that Mengele be extradited to face the charges.

326
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.990
Mengele was warned what was happening and fled to Paraguay.
Yeah.
Later,

327
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.620
he'd moved on to Brazil where he settled in with a Hungarian couple on a small

328
00:18:27.621 --> 00:18:29.690
farm,
about 300 balls from Sao Paolo.

329
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.060
In mid 1962 he moved again this time to a 45 hack to farm.
That's Sierra Negra,

330
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.530
150 miles north of Sao Paulo where he boarded with the Strauss family and his

331
00:18:39.531 --> 00:18:42.440
old age Mengele became arrogant,
surly and self centered.

332
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.340
He treated other people and there's his intellectual than just racial inferiors

333
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.120
in 1960 for a war crime trials and Mengele was held in absentee Teesha

334
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.440
throughout the course of the trial.

335
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.580
The gruesome details of his experiments where related often by surviving human

336
00:18:55.581 --> 00:18:57.890
Guinea pigs.
As a result of these revelations,

337
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.460
he became a hated figure for the vast majority of West Germans.

338
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.520
By 1917 the efforts to get mangler extradited had petered out since he had

339
00:19:10.521 --> 00:19:13.590
largely been forgotten of ask that you continue to live and unhappy life with

340
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:15.560
the stress of family.
It had grown to load them.

341
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.060
In 1976 he suffered a stroke from which he only partially recovered.
He finally,

342
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.440
Matt has ended in February of 1979 suffering a fatal stroke while swimming at

343
00:19:24.441 --> 00:19:28.010
the beach and 30 yoga in Silva moments.
He took his last breath.

344
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.690
He never says a single regret about his actions at Auschwitz.

345
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.560
