WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.110
His nickname is still known across the globe.
Simon Bolivar arm,

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.360
the El Libera Tattoo or the liberator,

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.160
the man who almost single handedly arrested South America from Spanish control.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.760
He was without a doubt one of the most important men who ever lived.

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.860
A Latino George Washington,

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.870
a general who could stand up shoulder to shoulder with Napoleon in his short

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.670
life.
He United all of modern Colombia,
Venezuela,
Panama,

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.760
and Ecuador into a single superstate and then live long enough to see all his

9
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.190
dreams turn to dust in the harsh daylight of independence.
Soldier,

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
hero Xr,
radical general dictator,
man of the people,
Simon Bolivar.

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.400
He was many things yet outside of Latin America,

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.720
knowledge of his life is something most of us are sorely lacking.
Well,

13
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:53.190
today we're taking you on a sweeping right through the epic life of the man.

14
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.680
No Day history as the liberator.

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.160
If you were putting bats on which newborn baby mice grew up to be a

16
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.670
revolutionary in 1783 Caracas,

17
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.400
Simon Bolivar would have been far down your list.

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.070
Born into a wealthy Spanish descended family.

19
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.790
Young Boulevard was one of the richest voice in the whole of Venezuela.

20
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.350
But even in these early days,

21
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:29.670
there were signs that the prince of Caracas didn't lead the easy life.

22
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:31.200
His position would suggest,

23
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.000
while avant was barely three when his wealthy father died and not yet a 10 when

24
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.610
his mother followed her husband into the grave,

25
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.970
left in the charge of a disinterested uncle boulevard was seen,

26
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:46.590
dumped upon eight succession of tutors that he did his best to ignore.

27
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.030
With one exception,

28
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.860
Simon Rodriguez shed more than just a first name with boulevard.

29
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.910
He shared the works of John Zachary,
so,

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.920
and other icons of liberal thought boulevard often feigned disinterest.

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.230
Rodriguez must've gotten something right though.

32
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.390
When he began his Revolutionary Korea,

33
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.270
it would it be these lessons that volleyball would you use as the raw

34
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.270
ingredients of his own political philosophy?

35
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.040
Not anything as coherence as a political philosophy was on bolivares minds at

36
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.500
the time,
cause the 16 year olds,

37
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.810
rich good would seem to be heading off to Europe where I'm like all of

38
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.980
Venezuela's aristocracy.
He would take in the court in Spain,

39
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.870
choir and education,
maybe find a bride and has returned to Caracas,

40
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:31.050
is ready to join the elite and in a way that's kind of what happens boulevard.

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.650
He arrived in Madrid just as the 18th century was drawing to a close.

42
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.740
He spent time at court and married his great love.

43
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.240
This was Maria Teresa Rodriguez del Toro.
He,

44
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.010
Lisa in the parallel universe.

45
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:47.850
The rest of his biography would probably now read and then he retired to Caracas

46
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.300
and settle into a life of privilege.
So I really hope you liked that video,

47
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.640
but that's not what happens.
Once again,

48
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.730
what looks like an easy existence for boulevard quickly gave way to pain less

49
00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.980
than a year after their marriage.

50
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.430
He and Maria Theresa returned to Caracas to settle down,
barely.

51
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.780
Where are they off the boat when Maria Theresa contracted yellow fever and died.

52
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.060
If you're looking for the moment,
Simon Bolivar,

53
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:14.500
the Prince of Caracas became Simon Boulevard.
The revolutionary this,

54
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.543
this is it.

55
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.580
Boulevard was so distraught by his wife's death that he made a sworn vow to

56
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:25.360
never marry again,
a vow that he caps for the rest of his life.
He certainly did.

57
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:29.740
His fair share of sleeping around is he threw himself into politics as a means

58
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.420
of escaping the heartache.

59
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.530
It was this decision that really set him on the path to greatness.

60
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.300
There was one other side effect of Maria Theresa's death in 1804 bollards on

61
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.240
decided to return to Europe.
It was a while back on the old consonants.
This,

62
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.940
he would make another solemn vow,

63
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:49.360
one which would have repercussions for centuries to come.

64
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.360
In 1804 France was in the grip of a national awakening following the extreme

65
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:01.530
bloodshed of the revolution.

66
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:05.220
A new general has risen up to set the nation back on track.

67
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.150
He was seeing by liberal radicals across the world is almost a secular seconds

68
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.130
coming and enlightens mountain who's destruction of the older order was ushering

69
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:18.930
in a new and greater age.
As you've probably already guessed that general's name.

70
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.291
Well,

71
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:24.291
it was Napoleon Bonaparte Ans Boulevard was in fraud as to what he had achieved

72
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.430
with France rather than returns of the suffocating order of Madrid boulevard,

73
00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:34.431
decided to set sail to France to see this in lightens up hovel fast hands.

74
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.950
If Boulevard had hopes of being inspired by Napoleon,

75
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.280
they've he was quickly disappointed boulevard.
Now,

76
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.330
a young man reached Paris just as Napoleon was crowning himself emperor and

77
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:49.980
transforming from an enlightened despot into a straight up death spots.

78
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.940
Outrage did this naked power grab boulevard closed the windows of his Paris

79
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:58.260
apartment in protest on the day of the coronation refusing to join in the

80
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:02.050
revelries.
Disgusted by Spain,
disappointed by Napoleonic France.

81
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.970
Polyvore spend the next few years aimlessly drifting around Europe,

82
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.820
trudging the well-trodden root of the grand talk.

83
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.900
It was while on this trip he bumps into his old tutor,
Simon Rodriguez.

84
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.040
Rodriguez had long since then exiled from Venezuela for his radicalism.

85
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.040
The two they went to Italy together at some point.

86
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.120
Rodriquez seems to have lit the flame of independence in Bolivares soul because

87
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.780
when they reached Graham Boulevard claims at the top,
if the Aventine Hill,

88
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.500
one of the seven hills upon which the Great Roman Republic was founded there,

89
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.610
he swore a solemn vow to never rest until South America was free from Spanish

90
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:42.330
control.
It was the second grade val.
The boulevard would succeed in keeping,
yeah,

91
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.400
around the time that boulevard was traipsing around Italy,

92
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.460
two major things happens that would make bolivares val look laughably naive and

93
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.840
just as quickly make it look very prescient.

94
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.930
The first came in 1806 when they liberal radical known as Francisco de Miranda

95
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.350
rationally decided now was the time for South American independence and

96
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.250
Venezuelan patriots.
Miranda is today known as the precursor,

97
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.800
the man who preceded the liberator,

98
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.010
but what are boulevards name would become synonymous with success.

99
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:24.011
Miranda's became rather associated with catastrophe in the summer of 1806

100
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.420
Moran's at tried to launch a general uprising and Venezuela landing a partially

101
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.790
us funded small force on the country's coast,

102
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.580
but rather than flocking to his side,

103
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.690
ordinary Venezuelans caps out of the way as a Spanish forced to send it

104
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.710
capturing nearly the entire expedition.
Miranda,

105
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.460
you barely escaped with his life at the time it looked like the end of the

106
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:47.420
independent stream.

107
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.520
Venezuelans had been given a chance to rise up and they decided to lie low.

108
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.260
But then the second major thing happens that it blew the question open once

109
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:01.010
again in 1808 and Napoleon depose the king of Spain and installed his brother

110
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.570
Joseph on the Spanish throne for Venezuelans already uncomfortable with Spanish

111
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.500
rule.
This just far too much South America,

112
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.420
it exploded in revolts.

113
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.910
Newly arrived back in his hometown boulevard quickly decided these antique

114
00:07:14.911 --> 00:07:19.880
French uprisings were the perfect vehicle for his patriotic dreams initially on

115
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.360
the sidelines of the action and correct because a lot of art students stage to

116
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:27.080
take over a group known as the Patriotic Society for the development of

117
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:27.830
agriculture.

118
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.060
And livestock and turning it into a hotbed of revolutionary activity.

119
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.340
While many of his contemporaries felt he was too radical boulevard,

120
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.250
nonetheless maters influenced,
felt.

121
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.580
It was following a stirring speech of his to Congress that Venezuela declared

122
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:45.581
independence on April the 19th 1810 and on the boulevard was anywhere close to

123
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.830
the true levers of power caps on a short leash.

124
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.160
It was only as personal wealth that got him an official position in the new

125
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:54.470
government as an ambassador to Britain,

126
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.450
while they're boulevard managed to convince the exiled Francisco de Miranda to

127
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.900
return to lead Venezuela registration that he would later regret when Miranda

128
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.300
wrote his flair for catastrophe or with him.

129
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.540
Now a whole books could be written on why Miranda was the wrong man for the job.

130
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:14.900
Here he was a poor general who allows royalist forces to maintain footholds in

131
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:15.734
the young country.

132
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.240
It was also a poor judge of talents in sidelines tacticians Lincoln Boulevard in

133
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.900
favor of weaker leaders.
On top of all that,
he was poor in a crisis.

134
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.610
When an earthquake flattens Karaca sin 1812 Miranda failed to control the

135
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:33.440
narrative that God was punishing the upstart Venezuelans for defying the Spanish

136
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:33.980
crown.

137
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.520
Although bolivares acquitted himself well digging through the rubble of Caracas

138
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:42.050
with his bare hands to rescue survivors public feeling the gams are turning

139
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:43.310
against the Republicans.

140
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.370
By summer of 1812 Venezuela was in revolt again this time against Miranda

141
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.940
Bolivar and they're failed.

142
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.941
Republic [inaudible] trying to staunch the tides by setting himself up as a

143
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.890
dictator.
But now the writing,
it was on the wall.
In August,

144
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.570
Rhonda snapped at bolted.

145
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.410
He was caught by Bolivar and other Republican soldiers trying to board a British

146
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:08.910
ship with the contents of the Venezuelan treasury and incensed boulevard hands.

147
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.930
It is asked to our friends over to the Spaniards before fleeing into exile

148
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.550
himself as he sailed away from Venezuela boulevard left behind the ruins of a

149
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:21.900
republic that had collapsed after only a year burying his dreams just as the

150
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:25.770
great earthquake it buried Caracas.
Just as with the earthquake.

151
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.800
If boulevard wanted to salvage anything from this catastrophe,

152
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.600
he was going to have to roll up his sleeves and personally start

153
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.523
<v 1>digging.</v>

154
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.310
<v 0>It was wild and Exxon and Catia Heena,</v>

155
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.530
which is today in Columbia that boulevard did,

156
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.720
is metaphorical digging for Muncie,

157
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.040
analyze the failures of the first Venezuelan republic determines to rescue some

158
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:54.240
lessons from the rubble.
The results was his l manifesto,
Dikata Haina,

159
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.680
the Carter Hannah Manifesto,

160
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.580
which today reads like a cheat sheet for understanding Bolivarian Thought

161
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.390
Boulevards decided the main thing wrong with Venezuela was its lack of a strong

162
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:04.050
government.

163
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.740
Although he pinpointed the failure of Miranda to root out all raw list forces

164
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.310
and the creation of a federalist rather than a centralist republic.

165
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.840
He also made vague noises about invading Venezuela and restoring independence,

166
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:19.740
but nobody in content.
Pena thought Hetero rarely do it.

167
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.650
How wrong they were.

168
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.020
In winter of 1812 boulevard went seriously off.

169
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:28.590
Scripts commissioned into the new Granada Rami,
and given a small and garrison,

170
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.740
he suddenly abandoned his post and took his men on a suicidal charge up the

171
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.360
Magdalena River.
The challenge being aimed at the royalist.

172
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:38.580
Fourth is that still controlled most of the country.

173
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.410
It should have been the end of boulevard,

174
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.350
but instead it was his making bolivares blitzkrieg annihilated the Spanish low

175
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.360
forces stations along the river,
overwhelmed and terrified.

176
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:52.770
They simply abandoned town.
After town was boulevard came roaring through.

177
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.700
By the end of January,
the entire river was in Patriot hands.

178
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.430
It was a resounding victory for the independence movement he had to.

179
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.030
Bolivar wasn't even close to being done like a man possessed.

180
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:06.630
He ended the Magdalena campaign,
not with a well absorbed arrest,

181
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.690
but with the invasion of Venezuela.

182
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.790
The invasion today is known as the admirable campaign,
but make no mistake,

183
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:18.840
the admirable part certainly doesn't refer to Bolivares conduct.

184
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.500
Desperate to be the ones and liberate Venezuela and Restore The republic

185
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:25.230
boulevard resorted to some very dirty tricks.

186
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.620
Chief among them was the decree of war to the death,

187
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.580
which stated that any native Spaniards who did not actively help them liberate

188
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:35.670
Venezuela would be executed on the spot.

189
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.240
Whatever the legalities of Bolivares semi genocide or decree,

190
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.600
it certainly worked as a second uprising.

191
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:47.601
Gripped Venezuela's east boulevard rampage across its West liberating city after

192
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:53.010
city justice he had done on the Magdalena campaign.
By July,

193
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.130
royalist forces were collapsing under the unsought by August.

194
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.530
Resistance said simply melted away.

195
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.620
On August the sixth 1893 Simon Boulevard marched into Caracas and declared a new

196
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:08.770
republic barely a year before he had fled the city.

197
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.930
As his dreams collapsed.
Now he was resurrecting them from the ashes.

198
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.280
The admirable campaign remains one of the greatest military victories in all of

199
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:20.260
history,
and about half a year,

200
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:24.760
bolivares single handedly destroyed the royalist upper hand in Grand Colombia

201
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.400
and free Venezuela from Spanish rule.

202
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.050
It's one of the main reasons his name still carries a significant way today.

203
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.130
Unfortunately,

204
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.280
it also sowed the seeds of the second republics destruction out on the plains of

205
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:40.780
Venezuela,
news of boulevards,
Walker,

206
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.100
I'm is reached the bandits and the cowboys under the leadership of Pro Spanish

207
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:46.210
psychopath,
hosay,

208
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:51.211
Tom and Bob as these disparate groups United into a force of Auntie Bolivar,

209
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.410
vengeance,
they were called the legions of hell,
the Isis of their day.

210
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.940
The legions of how glorified in the rape,
mutilation,
torture,

211
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.290
and massacring of anyone who stood in their way off to boulevard is a victory.

212
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.380
They swept across Venice sweater with such ferocity.

213
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.110
Even the liberator stood no chance.

214
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.160
Caracas fell in an orgy of blood in July,

215
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.200
1814 and boulevard fled back to new Granada.

216
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.250
I need to find royalist forces in the sense although he would launch a

217
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:23.860
successful campaign against separatists in Bogota.

218
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.840
Bolivares time was over by May,

219
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.140
1850 and even Carta Haina has turned against the hero of Magdalena and spot

220
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.980
Lavar.
He was forced to flee to Jamaica once again watching from the ship as the

221
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:40.480
fairness.
Wade and republican burns and his victories collapsed into dust.

222
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.740
Most men would have given up at this point,
but most men are not.

223
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:45.760
Simon Boulevard

224
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.980
it was wall and recalibrating in is Axon in British Jamaica,

225
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.300
but the liberator wrote the Second Grade Bolivarian taxed the letter from

226
00:13:59.301 --> 00:14:01.610
Jamaica along cry for liberty and freedom.

227
00:14:01.611 --> 00:14:05.330
The letter is today notable for one very important passage.

228
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.290
Sang American natives lacks the virtue for democracy due to centuries of Spanish

229
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:09.950
oppression.

230
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.840
Boulevard declared a free South America would need a strong hand at the wheel.

231
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.490
Uh,
presidents for life.

232
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.480
There was the first inkling that the world has of the liberator's hidden

233
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.010
dictatorial tendencies,
but the latter.

234
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.450
It was only seen ominous in hindsight.
For now,

235
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:30.980
boulevard was an outcast watching his country plunge into a vicious civil war.

236
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.490
He needed to get back to Venezuela and he needed to do it fast.

237
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.500
But luckily help us on hand from a surprising source.
A decade earlier,

238
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.310
Haiti has thrown off.
It's French shackles and declared itself free.

239
00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:47.420
The only successful slave rebellion in modern history as a plantation owner,

240
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.750
Balaban was himself a slave or something that should have put him at odds with

241
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.320
Haiti's governments.
It might've were it not for Haitian.

242
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:59.321
President Alexander Patty on in 1815 boulevard met with patty on to discuss

243
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.050
South American independence.
Patty on promised the revolutionary guns,
money,

244
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.530
ships,
and support for free in Venezuela.
But there was a condition.

245
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.780
Bolivar would have to swear to free all of the slaves in South America starting

246
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:12.614
with his own.

247
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.790
The deal is controversial today because while boulevard did give up his own

248
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:21.290
slaves,
he never forced any of his fellow Ridge Venezuelans to follow suit.

249
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.071
Regardless,

250
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:26.840
Bolivares word was enough and the Haitian presidents equips the liberator for

251
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:29.300
war for the third time in a decade,

252
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.650
but it's our returns to Venezuela to free it from royalist hands,

253
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.090
but first there would be a grinding war of attrition for three years,

254
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:42.110
Valvar made as many losses as he did.
Gains while Haitian money kept his army,

255
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:46.910
a flow to the royalists was simply too strong to dislodge in this long period.

256
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.480
Perhaps the only real victory boulevard had was convincing who San Antonio

257
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:52.910
payers to join him.
A cowboy in the grasslands.

258
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:57.080
Payers had raised his own anti-rail list army from the remnants of the legions

259
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:00.740
of how it would be his men that would help ensure bolivares victory,

260
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.670
but only after boulevard had proved himself worthy of them before he deferred to

261
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:05.504
the liberator.

262
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.920
Pat has challenged him to a series of physical feats culminating in a nonstop

263
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.330
all night ride that depend on us as amazements went home so long he christened

264
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.860
Bolivar ins in 1819 the war was in stalemate.

265
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.910
Then in spring ins had a brainwave with Ryan.

266
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:23.960
This is focused on defending Caracas.

267
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.630
Why not attack the Vice Regal Capitol of Bogota?

268
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.500
No one had the tanks before because it was separated by an impossible line of

269
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:34.010
mountains.
No one has even bothered to defend these only bolivar.

270
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.550
He didn't think that these mountains where as impossible as everyone seemed to

271
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:42.380
think and to May you set out to prove it.
The going was beyond tough.

272
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.131
Roaring rivers,

273
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:47.030
miles of flooded plains and torrential storms had to be braved before bolivares

274
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:49.040
army even reached the Andes.

275
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.780
Then the soldiers had to India a grueling 13,000 foot climb and a march through

276
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:55.130
the snow and the ice.

277
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.450
By the time the reached new Granada to thousands of his men would debt,

278
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.580
but it had been worth it with the Spanish.

279
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:04.790
Assuming no army would be insane enough to try and cross the Andes.

280
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.190
The road to Bogota was wide open.

281
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.380
The moments boulevard descended from the mountains.

282
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.110
It was game over one Spanish general.

283
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.400
A guy called Barry Arrow stood in his way and it's boulevard made absolute

284
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.660
mincemeat of him at the battle of biocar bolivar and Neha later the writer's

285
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:25.661
troops in under two hours suffering only 66 casualties to bury arrows,

286
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.910
nearly two thousands then he marched straight devote guitar just four days

287
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.460
earlier.

288
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.380
New Granada had been under Spanish control and now it was in the hands of

289
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:40.640
boulevard.
Boulevard's march across the Andes changed the course of history.

290
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.370
He installed himself as dictator of new Granada.

291
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.200
Now renames grand Colombia and set about rebuilding his army with momentum on

292
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.810
Bolivares side was nothing that the remaining Spanish forces could do.

293
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.300
After an awkward six months,

294
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.310
[inaudible] Boulevard marched back into Venezuela on June the 24th 1821 the

295
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:02.070
royalists were Naya lated with a revolution in Spain,

296
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:05.700
meaning no new trips would be coming to help the remaining royalists.

297
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:08.310
They simply gave up by August Boulevard,

298
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.460
had done it the thing he'd sworn to do in Rome or those years ago after his

299
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:18.240
third liberation.
Venezuela would never again be under Spanish control as a joy,

300
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:22.320
as Bolivar folded as homeland into his new Grand Columbian superstate.

301
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.540
He must've thought his story had finally ended.
Unfortunately though for history,

302
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.660
it's still had one final depressing chapter.

303
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.170
Over the next few years.

304
00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:42.220
The remaining provinces of Spanish South America were liberated in 1822

305
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.330
bolivares protege,

306
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:47.760
Antonio Jose to sucrose and liberated Ecuador in 1824 boulevard and secretes

307
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.370
together liberated Peru.
Half a year later they liberated upper Peru,

308
00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:54.460
which we're so grateful that it immediately renamed itself.
Bolivia.

309
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.840
Ecuador was folded into Grand Colombia while Peru named boulevard dictator for

310
00:18:58.841 --> 00:18:59.470
life.

311
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.880
The Spanish were gone and boulevard rules half of South America and it was that

312
00:19:03.881 --> 00:19:06.730
last part there was about to become a serious problem.

313
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.270
If Boulevard was a great general,
he was not such a great dictator.

314
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.680
He wasted money constantly on military expeditions and every time one of his

315
00:19:14.681 --> 00:19:17.680
underlings trying to press through unnecessary structural reforms.

316
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.410
A lot of our with next them leaving the economy.
Evening Mass.
On top of that,

317
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.650
he kept trying to force all of the countries had liberated to accept being a

318
00:19:26.651 --> 00:19:30.730
part of Grand Colombia when it was plainly obvious that new Granada,
Ecuador,

319
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:34.600
Venezuela,
Peru,
all wanted to go their separate ways back in Venezuela,

320
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.230
payers was even threatening to succeed fearing a civil war.

321
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.400
Bolivar abandons Peru and rotor back to Bogota and only for Peru to invade

322
00:19:42.401 --> 00:19:46.720
Ecuador in his absence as boulevard trying to hold ground Columbia together,

323
00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:50.290
he began assuming more and more powers until just like Napoleon,

324
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:55.360
he to flee transitions from enlightened despot to just plain old desk.

325
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.940
Spot effigy is where burns of him in the streets.

326
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.160
When he tried to have a new constitution written,

327
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.750
it wound up being so liberal that Bolivar instead ignore this and held onto his

328
00:20:04.751 --> 00:20:05.410
powers.

329
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.410
By 1828 he was so unpopular that he was very nearly assassinated in Bogota and

330
00:20:11.081 --> 00:20:14.560
had to spend hours hiding in a ditch in order to evade capture,

331
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.710
despised in his new home,
his health beginning to fail.

332
00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:22.630
In 1829 Balboa was forced to watch as payers succeeded from Grand Colombia

333
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.960
creating the state of Venezuela.
As he did so,

334
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.000
he issued a decree that boulevard should be executed if he ever set foot in the

335
00:20:31.001 --> 00:20:34.030
country again now also cut off from his homelands.

336
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.750
The liberator fell into a deep depression is correct as the states were

337
00:20:37.751 --> 00:20:42.100
confiscated by payers as new governments leaving him penniless or revolutionary

338
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:45.280
ghost haunting the streets of Boca type.
Finally,

339
00:20:45.281 --> 00:20:49.990
Bolivia excepted the inevitable and went into exile as interacts from Bogota to

340
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:54.070
the coastie received news that Ecuador had succeeded and that his protege suit

341
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.760
gray had been assassinated,
broken,
miserable,
despised,

342
00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:59.620
and dying from tuberculosis.

343
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.060
While I finally wound up in the house of a Spanish admirer and the coastal city

344
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.710
of Santa Marta,
although his hosts sense for the best doctors in America,

345
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:09.940
it was useless.

346
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:15.060
At the end of 1830 all of our board boarded is final boat into the lung exile of

347
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:18.160
death.
As he slipped away from the shores of the living,

348
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:22.240
it's possible he looked back and felt familiar.
Sadness once again,

349
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.250
Grand Colombia lay in ashes.
His dreams,
where ruins,
I need this time.

350
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.920
There'd be no coming back,
no more chances.

351
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.700
As Boulevard sailed away into endless night,
he did so.

352
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.280
A sad and a broken man.

353
00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.720
Although Boulevard Deiter hated tyrants today he is regarded as one of the

354
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.610
greatest men Latin America ever produced.
While Venezuela is now a basket case,

355
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.460
Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru are functioning democratic states in perfect.

356
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.760
The liberating may have been,

357
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:56.350
but there's no doubting Simon bolivares military genius or the strength of his

358
00:21:56.351 --> 00:22:00.370
vision.
A few people can ever be said to have truly changed history,

359
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.750
but bolivar is one of them.
So I already have you found the video.
