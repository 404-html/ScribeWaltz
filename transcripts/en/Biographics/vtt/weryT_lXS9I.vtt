1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.280
I'm just going to hit something off at the pass right here.

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:06.330
V Person We're covering in today's video has a Mongolian name.

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.130
It's an old Mongolian named.

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:10.890
We're not really even sure how it would be pronounced,

5
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.350
and I'm certainly not Mongolian,
so I'm just going to go with [inaudible].

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.450
I looked up some videos on youtube that seems to be a sort of accepted western

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.240
pronunciation.
It's what I'm going with.
If you really want to,

8
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.330
you can have a go at me in the comments.
So the Mongolian empire,

9
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:28.440
his rhythm is for that Bob Barrick conquests and the power of their great

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:31.890
leaders that managed to spread the embargo across several continents.

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.970
But one of the most fascinating people that has been forgotten from the empire

12
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.970
is the warrior princess could her urine.
She was the great,

13
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.990
great granddaughter of Gangas Con,

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.010
and she truly inherited his strength battle.

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.800
Unlike many other princesses and queens throughout the history of the wells,

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.970
Cotto was remembered for her own glory rather than the achievements of a husband

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.963
or a son,

18
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.890
or she may just have been the strongest Mongolian warrior of all time.

19
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.830
And in this week's biographics her life.

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.823
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.640
<v 0>Before we get into the details about the life of Kotor Yoon,</v>

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.090
it's important to go over some of the details of the Mongolian empire.

23
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.730
For thousands of years,
various tribes in Mongolia,

24
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:24.670
it went to war with one another and they were never your nightmares.

25
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.810
Under one single government plans and horses were taken as spoils of war.

26
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.710
Women and children were seen as the property of men and they were used as

27
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:33.850
trophies of conquest.

28
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.810
Powerful men had more than one wife and chief Danes typically had a harm.

29
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.800
Genghis Khan became the first leader to unite all of Mongolia.

30
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.460
He achieved this by training his army to be masterful warriors that were

31
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.650
stronger than many other army in the world.

32
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.220
They trained falcons to send messages and communicate with one another,

33
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:54.190
which helps him to spread his army over vast territories.

34
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.390
He pushed his men to train harder to become a new breed of super warrior.

35
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.950
Genghis Khan once said,

36
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.630
I man's greatest pleasure is do defeat his enemies to drive them before him,

37
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.030
to take from them that which they possessed,

38
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.940
to see those whom they cherished in tears,

39
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.680
to ride their horses and to hold their wives and daughters in his arms.

40
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.280
Angus,

41
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.450
Colin's army was so strong they were able to defeat the tribe is one by one.

42
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.680
After uniting Mongolia,
he set his sights much farther than his own country.

43
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.050
He wanted to become the ruler of the entire world.
He took over parts of Asia,

44
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.140
the Middle East,
and Europe.

45
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.160
It became the largest empire in the history of humanity.

46
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.920
Even though their army was known for being ruthless warriors,

47
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:39.670
the Mongolian Empire actually brought a lot of innovations to the world during

48
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:42.490
times of peace.
They were tolerance if religions.

49
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:46.240
They encouraged international trade and they were known for that diplomacy.

50
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.870
Ganga is column.
It had several wives of his own and he had many,
many children.

51
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.831
His grandson,

52
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:55.240
Kublai Khan became the ruler of Mongolia in the year 1260 and his brothers and

53
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.930
cousins held positions of power all over the empire.
Unfortunately,

54
00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:02.680
if Kublai Khan,
he was not as feared as his great grandfather hood.

55
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940
One spin spinner,
Mongolia woods eventually begin to break off into civil wars.

56
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.440
Kublai Khan would even go to war with his own brother.
AREC book.

57
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.210
A man named kid was Kublai Khan's cousins.
He was the leader of the house.

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.044
If they die,

59
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.630
the two cousins disagreed with one another on house and run the end buyer in

60
00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:24.490
this,
which eventually caused them to go to war as well.
Kid who had 14 sons,

61
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:27.930
but his favorite child by far was his daughter [inaudible],

62
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.620
an Italian explorer record.

63
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.550
Marco Polo wrote down the history of the Mongolian empire whilst living amongst

64
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.770
Kublai Khan's.
Raul caught most of what is known about humans.

65
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.950
Life came from his books as well.

66
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.670
There's some comments made by a Persian statesman named Rashid al Din.

67
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.610
She was called by several names,
including [inaudible],

68
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:47.380
which translates to shining moon.

69
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.170
While this is a beautiful name to give to a baby girl,

70
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.790
she would grow up to prove that she was far from a dainty princess.
Okay.

71
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.900
<v 2>Uh,</v>

72
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.570
<v 0>because of getting his cons legacy for future generations of Mongolian warriors,</v>

73
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.150
we're trained to be some of the strongest people on the planet.

74
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.390
If they wanted the Mongolian Empire to stretch across the globe,

75
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:17.020
they needed to be prepared to take down any enemy.
By the age of two,

76
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:20.890
boys were already learning how to shoot bows and arrows and ride on horseback.

77
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.560
They wrestled one another to learn hand to hand combat.

78
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.720
They practiced both the Chinese martial arts of Kung Fu as well as ancient

79
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.320
Mongolian fighting techniques.

80
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.960
They weren't just doing all of this training on foot either.

81
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.800
All of their fighting techniques also needed to be executed while riding at high

82
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.420
speeds on horseback.
This included both wrestling and archery.
Because of this,

83
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.930
the enemies would always and never be able to knock a Mongolian off of his horse

84
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.720
no matter how hard they tried in Mongolia,

85
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.880
horses are a huge part of that culture.

86
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.630
The number of horses actually outnumbers the human population.
People,

87
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:54.820
late horse masons,
they drank mare's milk.

88
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.730
This milk was actually fermented into an alcoholic beverage,

89
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:01.360
which is considered to be the national drink of Mongolia.
To this very day.

90
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.830
There is a saying,
a Mongol without a horse is like a bird without the wings.

91
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.430
While all of this training,
fighting and partying was normal for boys,

92
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.350
it was always never taught to girls.

93
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:15.640
Women were expected to be delicate and subservient to men while they took care

94
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:19.830
of the farming,
the child rearing and various household tasks.
Qt Unit,

95
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.530
it was a Tom boy since she was young and she wanted to practice fighting with

96
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.920
the boys far more than she was willing to dance or play with dolls.

97
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.360
It is record of his adventures.

98
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:32.380
Marco Polo describes could have Yoon as looking statuesque.
She was so tall.

99
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.480
One might mistake her for a giant test.

100
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.720
Since the members of the royal family always chose the most beautiful women in

101
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.460
the country to take as their wives.

102
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:43.300
She would have also been very pretty most likely looking like a modern day

103
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.620
supermodel.
But unlike most princesses,
cuter union isn't remembered for looks.

104
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.470
She was known for her incredible wrestling skills.

105
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.740
You could say that she was the world's first celebrity female wrestler long

106
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:58.010
before the ages of glow in the WWE.
She was so ahead of our time.

107
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.670
It would take hundreds of years after our death before female wrestling would

108
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.070
even be an acceptable sport around the world.

109
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.360
Mongolian style wrestling is very different from what you see on TV or even what

110
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:09.350
you saw in your high school.

111
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.550
There was no separation of weight class just to people lock arms and they try to

112
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.330
push each other over in many way.

113
00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:18.770
They can imagine arm wrestling and he using your entire body to push the other

114
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:20.000
person down to the grounds.

115
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.150
Once the opponent is knocked to the floor of the person who remained standing is

116
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:24.140
the winner.
Because of this,

117
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:27.620
the person's physical strength usually determines who the victim will be.

118
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.310
Couldn't even practice wrestling and continue to get stronger every day.

119
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.910
She was seen better than any man she had ever gone up against and she had the

120
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:37.850
goal of becoming the strongest wrestler in the world.

121
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.410
When she was old enough to get married,

122
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:43.570
several suitors began to show interest and making have that wife,
her father,

123
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.360
king kid begins,
you prepass them eligible suitors for hat could have done,

124
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:51.260
was not afraid to speak her mind to her father and to rebelliously announced

125
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.890
that she could never marry a man unless he was able to defeat her in a wrestling

126
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:56.450
match.
At that time,

127
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.320
even princes were not usually able to choose who that wife would be.

128
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.340
Politics trumped falling in love and his marriages where usually meant to keep

129
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.270
peaceful ties across the empire,
but since she showed so much strength,

130
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:12.290
Chi do gave his daughter his word that she would be free to marry any man of her

131
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:15.920
choosing and official proclamation was written and spread across the end buyer

132
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:17.990
announcing that his daughter was looking for her husband.

133
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.690
As long as he defeated in wrestling,

134
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.840
the entry fee was a hundred horses.
If they lost,

135
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.000
they'd have to forfeit their horses to the House of Aga dye,

136
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:30.080
which would only increase the wealth and power of their army.
Despite the facts,

137
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.870
there's horses a such a huge part of Mongolian culture.

138
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.620
People usually only had one or two per hell souls.
If they were lucky.

139
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.260
Owning a hundred horses was no simple task.

140
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.160
A man would have had to come from some kind of inability to even collect to the

141
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:46.850
entry fee.
We know there's at least 100 men showed up at the house.

142
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.320
If all get it to challenge to you into a match because she connected a fleet of

143
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:53.360
over 10,000 horses.

144
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.360
It's safe to assume that many of these men who came to win the match where

145
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.820
probably the feeling overly confidence before they arrived,

146
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.030
they probably felt the defeating and princess would be a piece of cake,

147
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.250
but they left feeling totally humiliated.

148
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.760
It probably took a few matches before word spread that this was no ordinary

149
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.570
princess and that men would need to train before they could even think about

150
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:12.404
challenging her.

151
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.800
These wrestling matches where talked about throughout Mongolia and many people

152
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:19.700
like Marco Polo traveled to see the fights Cootie Ian would show up wearing the

153
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:20.900
garment code.
Kendall,

154
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.870
this was usually one by men when they practice the martial arts,

155
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.050
but she would show up wearing a version that was made with expensive fabrics.

156
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.870
As soon as usually showed up wearing a similar style,

157
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.980
even though they were fighting,

158
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.800
they still showed up looking their best to the crowd.

159
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.590
In the year 1280 when could a human was 20 years old.

160
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:40.520
The son of King Pama arrived to try his luck in winning a match against the

161
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:41.180
princess.

162
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.180
The prince offered to wager a thousand horses instead of the typical 100 Marco

163
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.580
Polo described him as being young and incredibly good looking and he was

164
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.420
surrounded by an entourage of sevens when he showed up in the town and announced

165
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:56.130
that he wanted to battle acuity unit for her hand in marriage,

166
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.220
then women and children or showed up to witness this wrestling match and the

167
00:09:00.221 --> 00:09:03.960
true,
the biggest crowds by far.
My parents were very impressed.

168
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.580
They thought that he was a perfect match for her and encouraged cooter unions

169
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.870
lose on purpose so she could marry him.

170
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.970
She replied that she would never lose on purpose for any amount of money.

171
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.570
The man who was truly worthy of a hand in marriage would win without her

172
00:09:19.571 --> 00:09:21.280
throwing the match.
To his credit,

173
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:25.390
this prince lasted the longest out of any other wrestler to ever lock arms with

174
00:09:25.391 --> 00:09:28.600
the princess.
Often if she slammed the brakes,
songs of the palace floor,

175
00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:32.260
the sharing star buttons,
the room went silent for the first time ever.

176
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.010
The audience was actually disappointed that she had one since he lost it the

177
00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:38.350
longest and the wrestling match of any other man,

178
00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:42.190
maybe cool to une was truly considering if she should throw the match.
However,

179
00:09:42.191 --> 00:09:45.760
this man was exactly the sort of husband to father would have arranged that.

180
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.721
If you think about it,

181
00:09:46.721 --> 00:09:49.720
that does kind of defeat the purpose of her being able to choose a husband in

182
00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:50.554
the first place.

183
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.720
<v 3>[inaudible] off</v>

184
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.840
<v 0>the years of kicking ass and taking names,</v>

185
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:05.680
people began to wonder why cootie you'd want it to be a single virgin for the

186
00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:09.310
rest of her life.
Rumors began to spread about her in modern times.

187
00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:12.370
One might assume that she was a lesbian,
was a sexual preps.

188
00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:15.940
Even transgender just won't go near being one of the most progressive countries

189
00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:19.450
in the world.
At that time,
they were still not accepting of homosexuality,

190
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.320
so it's very possible that cootie union had a strong sense of self and she

191
00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:26.800
wasn't going to allow her father to force her into a marriage that would make

192
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:29.800
him miserable.
At the time,
the idea of being a lesbian,

193
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:33.130
it wasn't even an option in the minds of the public.
We're in the spread.

194
00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:37.090
That kid may have even had an incestuous relationship with his daughter.
However,

195
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.490
this,
it's probably unlikely.
Unfortunately.

196
00:10:39.491 --> 00:10:41.680
It's a rumor that we said of a lot of women back then.

197
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.950
It was just so out of the ordinary that the daughter was held in such high

198
00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:48.400
regard by her father and that he allowed her to remain unmarried.

199
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.030
The situation was so odd.
People simply didn't know what to make of it.

200
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.780
According to a passion statesman named rash it out,
didn't go to union,

201
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:59.500
was fighting so hard for freedom because she was in love with a man named Gaza.

202
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.850
He was the Mongolian leader of the Persian territories and a direct descendant

203
00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:05.080
of Ganga Ashcan as well.

204
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.410
That meant that they would have been cousins and maybe they union would have

205
00:11:08.411 --> 00:11:10.870
been forbidden because they were too closely related.

206
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.160
Whether the theory is true on Oscoda,

207
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.170
you never did marry Gaza and he is remembered for converting to Islam and

208
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.380
setting a new precedent for future rulers.
In Modern Day Iran,

209
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.490
he married another princess named Coco Chin who was nicknamed the blue princess

210
00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:28.390
and remembered for his stunning beauty locking in paradigm helped escort across

211
00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:30.280
the desert to meet her new husband's goody.

212
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.480
You would have been the polar opposites if this datey frail princess.

213
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.830
It's possible there's a hot belonged to a man that she simply couldn't have.

214
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.760
We never do learn if gives a union got married,
if she remains on married,

215
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:46.660
having an affairs with men,
or if she was secretly enjoying a harm of our own.

216
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.230
Most historians believe that she was single for the rest of her life because a

217
00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:52.870
royal wedding,
surely it would have been on the record somewhere.

218
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.390
What we do know though is that if she got married,

219
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.290
she would have never been allowed to live out her one true passion in life,

220
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.010
which was to be a warrior and she continued to do just that,

221
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.390
like the male Mongolian warriors.

222
00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:15.450
If a day cooter you and participated in many battles alongside her father and

223
00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:17.970
his army.
Since she was lighter than a male writer,

224
00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:21.790
she was able to gallop in on a horse at faster speeds than a male counterpart.

225
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.090
Since she was just a strong Marco.

226
00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:27.990
Polo describes a technique of galloping up to an enemy soldier on the opposite

227
00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:29.000
side of the battlefields,

228
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.240
picking him up with just one Hanson's lifting his body off the ground while on

229
00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:36.660
horseback and delivering the enemy back to her side of the battle.

230
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:41.280
She was like a hawk flying in on its prey and the enemy was understandably

231
00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:46.200
terrified of her.
Can I do con Fela?
Kuti unit was the best warrior in his own.

232
00:12:46.201 --> 00:12:48.570
The end,
she would have been a very capable leader.

233
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:53.040
She was even given a silver medallion cooled garagey to wear around her neck.

234
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.760
This is like the modern day equivalent of becoming a decorated general.

235
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.180
She has the only Mongolian woman to ever hold that honor and let's just

236
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.860
appreciate that statement for a moment.

237
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.520
If the Chi do to say that his daughter was the strongest warrior in his entire

238
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.130
Ami is a big deal.
Even in modern times,

239
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:11.910
it would be almost unheard of to see that a woman is stronger than an entire

240
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.890
army full of men and the Mongolians.
They were born and bred to be war machines.

241
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.400
Even though Chi Dukan wanted to appoint cooter unit as his successor,

242
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.040
putting a woman in charge was against the rules.

243
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.250
This was fine with you in though because she was much more at home on the

244
00:13:26.251 --> 00:13:28.590
battlefields then in a diplomatic position,

245
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.500
despite a hesitation to take over the throne.
As a young woman,

246
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:34.770
she still attended to a thought of those courts and was present for all of their

247
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:37.620
important meetings,
so she was well aware of the local politics.

248
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.430
The master was dropped and all of our brothers expected that one of them would

249
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:43.140
be declared the next con.

250
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:47.610
Whenever their father passed away in the year 30 no one can kid was dying and

251
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:51.180
his dying wish was for cootie une to takeover as cotton.

252
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.070
Even though he had 14 sons,

253
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:56.290
none of them could possibly have been as good of a military leader into

254
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.870
political leaders.
His daughter,

255
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.000
he attempted to break all Mongolian traditions and deployment.

256
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.670
Cootie Yoon as is true app at this point.
Cooter Yoon was 41 years old.

257
00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:09.510
She had years of experience behind her and she was respected and feared amongst

258
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:10.170
the army.

259
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.340
She was also old enough now to feel that she was ready to take home the role of

260
00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:17.430
leader.
However,
how brothers they weren't having it.

261
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.820
A man named duo was given the position as the new con.

262
00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:23.820
If their territory in 1306 cooter une whiskey killed,

263
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:26.820
and that is no record as to exactly how she died.

264
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.150
Considering that she had a following of soldiers who respected her,

265
00:14:30.151 --> 00:14:33.360
it's possible that there was a power struggle and that she was killed.

266
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.050
Most of you may have never heard of Cooper Union until now,

267
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.980
and that's probably because there is very little information from people who

268
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.500
actually knew her logo,

269
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.930
Pilar and rationale din all the only two historians who around in the 12

270
00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:49.290
hundreds to write down the details of her life.

271
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:54.290
And each of them only devoted one or two pages of their books to her story,

272
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.370
despite the fact that she was badly mentioned in these texts of the Mongolian

273
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.310
empire.
The story of his strength was so fascinating.

274
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.000
It was still passed along by both Mongolian and Chinese people.

275
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.050
Like simple word of mouth,
just like a childhood game of telephone.
Huh.

276
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.580
Story was convoluted over the years in the 17 hundreds a French writer named

277
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:18.470
Francois De de Della crew road stories from Asia for a Western audience and he

278
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.620
includes diversion of QT une story only in his telling,

279
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:25.610
she was a Chinese princess names tour Indo who refuses to marry a man unless he

280
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:28.850
could solve three riddles if they fail,
they die.

281
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.880
This story was eventually made into an Italian all opera QT you,

282
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:34.820
and I'll say briefly of heads and the Netflix series,
Marco Polo,

283
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:39.080
but it barely scraped the surface of how truly awesome she actually was.

284
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.400
And we hope in some way that with this video we've helped the true story of Qt

285
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.620
Yoon,
the warrior princess,
that volunteer.

286
