00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.861
<v Speaker 1>At the end,</v>

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>In this episode of biographics,</v>

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>we reveal the cold calculating life and the death of Heinrich Himmler.</v>

9
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Heinrich Luitpold Himmler was born on October the seventh 1900 after whistled</v>

10
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Barker Strauss to in Munich.</v>

11
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>He was the second of three sons to Gab Hoss and Anna Marie.</v>

12
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Hemlock Gephardt's was the deputy headmaster of land should high school</v>

13
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>bandwidths a pious and pedantic man.</v>

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>The family were well off,</v>

15
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't rich and they held a measure of prestige in the local</v>

16
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Downhearted previously been the tutors and the royal of whistles,</v>

18
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Bach princes.</v>

19
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It was this connection that led to the great honor of having Prince Heinrich of</v>

20
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Bavaria as Heinrich's Godfather.</v>

21
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Heinrich was not a well child.</v>

22
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>He was often absent from school with one illness or another.</v>

23
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Still he made up for the absences by simply working harder.</v>

24
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>By doing so,</v>

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Speaker 1>he proved himself to be an excellent students.</v>

26
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>A middle school teacher remembered him as a very keen people whose tireless</v>

27
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:31.371
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>

28
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.300
<v Speaker 1>burning ambition,</v>

29
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>and active participation in class have achieved excellent results.</v>

30
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>The man who would go on to persecute the Catholic clergy without mercy grew up</v>

31
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>as part of a devout family of believers.</v>

32
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.641
<v Speaker 1>As a youth,</v>

33
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>he wrote in his diary,</v>

34
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I would always love God and remain true to the church.</v>

35
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.651
<v Speaker 1>As a teenager,</v>

36
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Heinrich served as an altar boy,</v>

37
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>but when war broke out,</v>

38
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:51.831
<v Speaker 1>he developed,</v>

39
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>he desire to serve his country in a military capacity gap party forever</v>

40
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>nationalist approved and tried to use his royal contacts to smooth his son's</v>

41
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>path to becoming an officer.</v>

42
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

43
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.470
<v Speaker 1>the 17 year olds was turned down by the imperial navy due to his short</v>

44
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>sightedness.</v>

45
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.001
<v Speaker 1>He therefore,</v>

46
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>it turns into the army gaining entry and being sent to officer training school.</v>

47
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>But before he had completed his cadet ship,</v>

48
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.421
<v Speaker 1>the board,</v>

49
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>it was over.</v>

50
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the Fiera who he would come to greatly admire.</v>

51
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Hemlock saw none of the carnage of the Great War.</v>

52
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Fast hands.</v>

53
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.291
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

54
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 1>April,</v>

55
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.230
<v Speaker 1>1919 Himmler joins one of the many free corpse army units that winter time ends</v>

56
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>to crush the communist movements.</v>

57
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 1>During the next two years,</v>

58
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:45.790
<v Speaker 1>he served in various paramilitary organizations that were on the march against</v>

59
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

60
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.320
<v Speaker 1>the shame old treaty of Versailles and Marxists dictatorship.</v>

61
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Young Himmler had been frustrated that he didn't get to [inaudible] on the front</v>

62
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>lines during the war,</v>

63
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>ins lacking any direction he sought,</v>

64
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>a cause that he could embrace and a leader that he could respect him and his</v>

65
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>family had not been inherently anti Semetic and is that a 27 but he began</v>

66
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>reading the Jew bashing pamphlets that were circulating around Munich.</v>

67
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>He also got a hold of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.</v>

68
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>They faked the documents,</v>

69
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>the purported,</v>

70
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>you contain details of a Jewish wells conspiracy.</v>

71
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Hemlock came of age in a time when the old order of things was in a state of</v>

72
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

73
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.743
<v Speaker 1>The German people,</v>

74
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.583
<v Speaker 1>they were defeated.</v>

75
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Their economy decimated and their psyche damaged.</v>

76
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.873
<v Speaker 1>Irreparably.</v>

77
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>This school was a lot of fear.</v>

78
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of depression in the old order.</v>

79
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Hemler beat,</v>

80
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>son of a royal tutor would have found a secure place in society,</v>

81
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but now all bets were off.</v>

82
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>He would have to forge his own path.</v>

83
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Gerhard Himmler heard instills in his sons the two tonic ideal that the German</v>

84
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Aryan was the master human being.</v>

85
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>What Heinrich store on the streets of Munich and the early twenties was the</v>

86
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>opposite of Arion and supremacy.</v>

87
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>The people were fast sliding into decadence and in morality,</v>

88
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but this was no fault of the German people.</v>

89
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>His readings convinced him that the countries' ills could be laid at the feet of</v>

90
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:04.804
<v Speaker 1>one group,</v>

91
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and that was of course the Jews.</v>

92
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Him Low would spend the rest of his life.</v>

93
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Championing the two tonic ideal is constant refrain when faced with a situation</v>

94
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>was what would our forefathers have done in this situation?</v>

95
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Disgusted at what had happened to his beloved German nation.</v>

96
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>The young Himmler began making a plan to emigrate on November the 23rd 1921 he</v>

97
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>wrote the following in his diary.</v>

98
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.821
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

99
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I caught an article from the newspaper about immigration to Peru where I will</v>

100
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>end up Spain,</v>

101
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.461
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

102
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the Baltic countries,</v>

103
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

104
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Peru.</v>

105
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I often think about it in 10 years time,</v>

106
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I will no longer be in Germany.</v>

107
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.181
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

108
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>a year later,</v>

109
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>he was still in Germany,</v>

110
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but the dream of living abroad,</v>

111
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>it was still with him.</v>

112
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>In 1922 he inquired at the Soviet embassy about moving to the Ukraine as an</v>

113
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>estate manager.</v>

114
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.921
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

115
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>two decades later,</v>

116
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>he would send his death squads into Ukraine to decimate the lands and to wipe</v>

117
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>out it's Jewish inhabitants.</v>

118
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.091
<v Speaker 1>For now,</v>

119
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>his greatest ambition was to be a peaceful agricultural manager.</v>

120
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:04.130
<v Speaker 1>by the ends of 1922 him,</v>

122
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>La had completed a degree in agriculture and settled into a job as an</v>

123
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>agricultural assistant in a fertilizer factory.</v>

124
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1923 he joins the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party,</v>

125
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>also known as the Nazi party.</v>

126
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>He started off as a member of the paramilitary units under [inaudible],</v>

127
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>played a part in the unsuccessful beer haul putsch in an attempt to seize power.</v>

128
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>The police through several people,</v>

129
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>including Hitler himself in prison,</v>

130
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and he was questioned that he was released because of lack of evidence,</v>

131
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but his involvement in the attempted revolts let him to losing his job as an</v>

132
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>agricultural analyst with no money coming in.</v>

133
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>We had to move back in with his parents around this time and the appears to have</v>

134
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>fallen into a depressive state.</v>

135
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>He had a few friends and portrayed and aggressive volcanic personality.</v>

136
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic religion,</v>

137
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>which had been so dear to him,</v>

138
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>was abandoned,</v>

139
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>and the fascination with the occult began to take shape unlike a lot of other</v>

140
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>new recruits to the Nazi party,</v>

141
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>and that was an off immediately overawed by the presence of Adolf Hitler.</v>

142
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>This adoration that he had for the fear of it develops over a long time.</v>

143
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>As soon as his nature him let read everything he could about by Hitler,</v>

144
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>he came to appreciate him first on an intellectual level,</v>

145
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>the worship that would come soon enough.</v>

146
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Z now unemployed to 25 year olds,</v>

147
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

148
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>putting all of his energies into the cause of a national socialism.</v>

149
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.920
<v Speaker 1>He's are calling the position of secretary for Greg.</v>

00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:40.270
<v Speaker 1>All Strasser right pharmacist from land short who was standing as a candidate</v>

151
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:43.960
<v Speaker 1>for the Reichstag in return for a salary of 120 Reichsmarks.</v>

152
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.000
<v Speaker 1>He traveled around the Lower Bavaria on his motorcycle and gave inflammatory</v>

153
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>speeches against Jews and communists.</v>

154
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Strasser was a Nazi party member who was attempting to wrest control of the</v>

155
00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:57.970
<v Speaker 1>organization from the imprisoned Hitler believing that he would succeed him let</v>

156
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:02.260
<v Speaker 1>supported Strasser in this internal power struggle and the other 1920s the</v>

157
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.320
<v Speaker 1>notoriously shy Heinrich found frau line and us from Bromberg named Margo Tall,</v>

158
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>blonde and blue eyed.</v>

159
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.970
<v Speaker 1>She fits the Teutonic ideal and matched him Liz ideal image of Germanic</v>

160
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>womanhood.</v>

161
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.210
<v Speaker 1>The couple were married on July 3rd,</v>

162
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>1928 with Margo bringing a sizeable dowry to the Union.</v>

163
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.110
<v Speaker 1>The financial windfall enabled Heinrich to realize his dream of owning his own</v>

164
00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:28.060
<v Speaker 1>piece of land and they purchased a chicken farm not far from Munich during this</v>

165
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

166
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.630
<v Speaker 1>heavily managed to rise rapidly in standing within the party.</v>

167
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.490
<v Speaker 1>By 1926 he was deputy had a variety of propaganda and then deputy Reichsfuhrer</v>

168
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>ss I then Hitler had been released from prison,</v>

169
00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:44.491
<v Speaker 1>brushed aside the internal threat from Strasser and published his tone mine camp</v>

170
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Himmler effortlessly switched his allegiance back to Hitler.</v>

171
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>He devoured mine camp commenting that it contained an extraordinary number of</v>

172
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 1>truths very quickly Himmler's loyalty to Hitler.</v>

173
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It became absolute.</v>

174
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>By the mid 1920 set,</v>

175
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Lou came to the realization that he was in need of special protection force.</v>

176
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.750
<v Speaker 1>He needed a squad of men who gave him unquestioned loyalty and we're even</v>

177
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:19.660
<v Speaker 1>prepared to march against their brothers if need be.</v>

178
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So it had such a force.</v>

179
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 1>No one was as fervently devoted in.</v>

180
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:23.591
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

181
00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>so eminently suitors has Heinrich Himmler on January the second 1929 hit or</v>

182
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>appointed him low to the position of Reichsfuhrer ss.</v>

183
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.710
<v Speaker 1>But that time,</v>

184
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.330
<v Speaker 1>the SS was a small division of the larger essay which was under the headship of</v>

185
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.223
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong.</v>

186
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.860
<v Speaker 1>VSA was hitless private taught me the fighting quality of its men was</v>

187
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 1>questionable,</v>

188
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.820
<v Speaker 1>but Ron saw its strength coming from force of numbers.</v>

189
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.631
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>

190
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:49.000
<v Speaker 1>the SS was a far more elite force.</v>

191
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.370
<v Speaker 1>It's members wore black peaked cabs emblazoned with a skull along with black</v>

192
00:08:53.371 --> 00:08:55.150
<v Speaker 1>bordered swastika arm bands.</v>

193
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>This new position,</v>

194
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 1>it was ideal for him.</v>

195
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.441
<v Speaker 1>Since his youth,</v>

196
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:00.190
<v Speaker 1>he had been fascinated by the elites,</v>

197
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>praetorian guards that were the elites protection force of Rem and embarrass.</v>

198
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Now we have the opportunity to craft his own modern day Praetorian guard.</v>

199
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 1>He immediately began putting his own stamp on the ss he had to bell's buckles,</v>

200
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>made that were scripted with the words ss man.</v>

201
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty is Dayana.</v>

202
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>He also came up with a succinct motto for his men.</v>

203
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Be More than you seem when him assumed leadership VSS number around 200 men.</v>

204
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:27.871
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>

205
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it had grown to just over a thousand.</v>

206
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.880
<v Speaker 1>By June of 1934 it had swollen to 50,000 men in 1931 him that created a unit</v>

207
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>within that unit and it was called one C and it was put under the leadership of</v>

208
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>a rising star called Reinhardt Heidrick later to become the secret service.</v>

209
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>This was the organ by which Hitler could have undercover surveillance undertaken</v>

210
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>within the party.</v>

211
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.613
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

212
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.560
<v Speaker 1>By 1934 the essay on the Strom had become redundant now that he was chancellor,</v>

213
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>he had no need for a bunch of street thugs.</v>

214
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.721
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

215
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>his association with them,</v>

216
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>it was bound to be damaging to his career.</v>

217
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>It was time to break this private army up.</v>

218
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Him was delighted with the news that the essay along with its commander and</v>

219
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

220
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>we're about to be dealt with for five years.</v>

221
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>He had been a subordinates to the uncouth and disorganized rom whom he</v>

222
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>considered his social inferior.</v>

223
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>The threw himself into planning the overthrow of the essay.</v>

224
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>That history would recall as the night of the long knives documents before just</v>

225
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 1>to show that the essay was planning a coup and him look personally took these</v>

226
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>documents to hit not immediately.</v>

227
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Death lists were drawn up containing the names of essay leaders as well as any</v>

228
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>others who were seen by him.</v>

229
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:45.871
<v Speaker 1>Low rent,</v>

230
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Heidrick has threats to their growing palate.</v>

231
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>At the top of that list was Ernst wrong when Rome was taken into custody,</v>

232
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was actually in favor of commuting the death sentence as long term</v>

233
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:56.320
<v Speaker 1>colleague,</v>

234
00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but he was browbeaten by Himmler and Heidrick into eliminating him.</v>

235
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 1>This was in calling with hemlock underlying nature.</v>

236
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>He was a man who was completely devoid of scruples,</v>

237
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>lacking any of the normal inhibitions or pangs of conscious that would cause</v>

238
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>others to pause in such actions.</v>

239
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Theorists torments and murders if the night of the long knives were carried out</v>

240
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>by him,</v>

241
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>those assess their leader.</v>

242
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

243
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>he was a major beneficiary off this operation in the wake of the purging of the</v>

244
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.910
<v Speaker 1>essay him that took over headship of the Gestapo from um,</v>

245
00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 1>and Garing around that same time him,</v>

246
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:29.381
<v Speaker 1>the order,</v>

247
00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>the death of Gerhard Strasser,</v>

248
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the man he had earlier supported his Nazi party leader and it had been his</v>

249
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:35.964
<v Speaker 1>employer.</v>

250
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

251
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>By 1935 hemlock was in a position of great power within the Nazi state as well</v>

252
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 1>as heading the SS and the Gestapo.</v>

253
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>He was also in of the entire German police force.</v>

254
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>This allows him to participate in cabinet meetings with all the rights and</v>

255
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>privileges afforded a minister of the Reich.</v>

256
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>On October the 11th,</v>

257
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 1>1936 similar gave a speech in front of the Academy of German law in it,</v>

258
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 1>he made it clear how he was going to run the countries,</v>

259
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>police and defense forces,</v>

260
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 1>whether on us our actions conflict with a particular article or subsection is a</v>

261
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>matter of complete indifference to me and the fulfillments of my duty.</v>

262
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I do precisely what I can answer for them in my work for Fiora and nation and</v>

263
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>what equates with healthy common sense,</v>

264
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>whether or not others whined about a breach of the law is no concern to me.</v>

265
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Hello was only accepted the very best.</v>

266
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell nick men into the ss the organization was to be a racial elite</v>

267
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>class?</v>

268
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Hemlock made sure that he saw a photo of every applicants.</v>

269
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 1>The meticulously scans them in search of anything that might give evidence of</v>

270
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:46.114
<v Speaker 1>impurity.</v>

271
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Once he found his perfect specimens,</v>

272
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>he intended to do what he could to ensure that there were more of them.</v>

273
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.430
<v Speaker 1>And so on October the 28th 1939 he issued his procreation audit to the SS.</v>

274
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It was the highest duty of women and girls.</v>

275
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you conceive children by soldiers of the SS before they went into battle?</v>

276
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.241
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

277
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>if a female did not submit to the sexual demands of an ss man,</v>

278
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.250
<v Speaker 1>she was guilty of treason to the state and look,</v>

279
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 1>became obsessed with the idea of procreating.</v>

280
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 1>The worlds with pure Ariens and order went out so that every ss man was the</v>

281
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

282
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.910
<v Speaker 1>At least one child,</v>

283
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>he considered monogamy to be a sin.</v>

284
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 1>His men were allowed to have several wives in order to be able to father as many</v>

285
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:26.740
<v Speaker 1>future heroes as possible.</v>

286
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Under him,</v>

287
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 1>the SS became much more than a personal body guard for the fear,</v>

288
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 1>and La had been charged with restoring the nation to health.</v>

289
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.840
<v Speaker 1>This task required reading the country of racial impurity.</v>

290
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.471
<v Speaker 1>To do this,</v>

291
00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the assets would go through community after community and cleanse it of Jews,</v>

292
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.750
<v Speaker 1>free masons and Jesuits,</v>

293
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:58.010
<v Speaker 1>but Himmler how soon extended the list of undesirables to include Slavs,</v>

294
00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Gypsies,</v>

295
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.600
<v Speaker 1>homosexuals,</v>

296
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Jehovah's Witnesses,</v>

297
00:14:00.801 --> 00:14:01.760
<v Speaker 1>and communists.</v>

298
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.550
<v Speaker 1>When Hitler invaded Russia in 1941 hymnal or provided actions squad.</v>

299
00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:08.660
<v Speaker 1>So you would follow up the regular army as it conquered the lambs.</v>

300
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Their job was to say gold.</v>

301
00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:10.401
<v Speaker 1>All Jews,</v>

302
00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:12.530
<v Speaker 1>communists and Gypsies Himmler insured,</v>

303
00:14:12.531 --> 00:14:15.380
<v Speaker 1>that is men kept meticulous records of their activities.</v>

304
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.300
<v Speaker 1>One of the squad commanders had recorded 90,000 killings and just the last few</v>

305
00:14:20.301 --> 00:14:23.600
<v Speaker 1>months of 1941 these Moscow murders,</v>

306
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.020
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

307
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.220
<v Speaker 1>presented a problem that Himmler pat to provide a solution for having to kill so</v>

308
00:14:28.221 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 1>many people each day was proving challenging for the psyches of the soldiers</v>

309
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:32.810
<v Speaker 1>doing the work.</v>

310
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.610
<v Speaker 1>The question that entered his mind was,</v>

311
00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:39.110
<v Speaker 1>was there a more efficient way to kill that did not lead to such demoralization?</v>

312
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.351
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

313
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:39.711
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

314
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:43.430
<v Speaker 1>there was no question in his mind that the course of mass murder was morally,</v>

315
00:14:43.431 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 1>socially and politically correct.</v>

316
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.070
<v Speaker 1>For years,</v>

317
00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.400
<v Speaker 1>he had drilled two simple rules into the minds of his assess.</v>

318
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

319
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 1>the Futura was always right and secondly,</v>

320
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>the end justifies the means.</v>

321
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>He presented the mass extermination as a monumental secular mission that is men</v>

322
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>were privileged to be fulfilling after personally watching the execution of 200</v>

323
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Jews near Minsk.</v>

324
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

325
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>it is the cause of the great man to step over corpses.</v>

326
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of 1941 homeless summons the common dawns of the Auschwitz</v>

327
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp Rudolph halls to a meeting in Berlin.</v>

328
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 1>He informs him that the fear had ordered the final solution of the Jewish</v>

329
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 1>question BSS.</v>

330
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.310
<v Speaker 1>He told Hos or to carry out that order and he had selected outfits as the prime</v>

331
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 1>location to do it.</v>

332
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Austin out of Eichmann where to organize the genocide,</v>

333
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 1>but Himmler was the man in charge under him and watchful gaze.</v>

334
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:37.721
<v Speaker 1>The concentration camps with outfits as the shining model became incredibly</v>

335
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 1>efficient death factories.</v>

336
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Those passing through the gates of the camp where we did with those selected</v>

337
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>going directly to the gas chambers in less than 15 minutes,</v>

338
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:49.700
<v Speaker 1>they were dead victims of the highly poisonous gas,</v>

339
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>a Cyclin B for those who are considered fit for work,</v>

340
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 1>that death would come from exhaustion or starvation.</v>

341
00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Himmler paid a personal visit to Auschwitz in 1942 he watched as victims were</v>

342
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>selected and to watch through a spy hole in the gas chamber door.</v>

343
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 1>As the executions were carried out.</v>

344
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>He did not comment on what he saw,</v>

345
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:11.240
<v Speaker 1>which was assigned to commandant Hos that he was happy with what he witnessed.</v>

346
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 1>He wins on to inspect the rest of the camp during which time Hoss campaigns</v>

347
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:18.960
<v Speaker 1>about the squalid conditions and the dangers of disease to as men and let's</v>

348
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 1>stopped him in mid sentence and declared.</v>

349
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear any more about your difficulties for an ss officer that are</v>

350
00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Speaker 1>no difficulties,</v>

351
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>his duty is always to remove difficulties himself as soon as they arise.</v>

352
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 1>How you do it is for you to figure out not me.</v>

353
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.420
<v Speaker 1>By mid 1944 the tide of war per turn downs,</v>

354
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:48.670
<v Speaker 1>the writing was on the walls for the Nazi regime.</v>

355
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

356
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.820
<v Speaker 1>him and his unwavering loyalty to add,</v>

357
00:16:50.821 --> 00:16:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I've hit load were still intact.</v>

358
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.410
<v Speaker 1>This being the case,</v>

359
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:57.120
<v Speaker 1>historians have noted that it does seem odd that with his massive spine that</v>

360
00:16:57.121 --> 00:16:57.341
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

361
00:16:57.341 --> 00:17:00.970
<v Speaker 1>he did not have advanced warnings of the July 20th,</v>

362
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.930
<v Speaker 1>1944 plot to kill Hitler.</v>

363
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Some of you even speculated that he was involved in some way.</v>

364
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:05.651
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

365
00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It is true that three days before the attack he turned down a written Gestapo</v>

366
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:10.870
<v Speaker 1>request for permission to arrest.</v>

367
00:17:10.871 --> 00:17:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Two of the main plot is it's also clear that the ruthlessness with which the SS</v>

368
00:17:14.711 --> 00:17:18.490
<v Speaker 1>persecution machine went into action after the attack was not matched with.</v>

369
00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:21.520
<v Speaker 1>It's usually impeccable standard of surveillance before it.</v>

370
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It is probable that him that did not intend to portray Hitler on July the 20th</v>

371
00:17:25.391 --> 00:17:29.440
<v Speaker 1>of 1944 but that betrayal it was to come and it would manifest itself on the</v>

372
00:17:29.441 --> 00:17:33.460
<v Speaker 1>fear as birthday April the 20th 1945 on that day,</v>

373
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Himmler was a guest along with other high ranking Nazi is it what must surely</v>

374
00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:39.880
<v Speaker 1>have been one of the most macabre birthday parties in history?</v>

375
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It was held in the underground bunker that was there's final hideout situated in</v>

376
00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the heart of ravaged Berlin.</v>

377
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was unaware that him and I had a second later that day with an emissary</v>

378
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>from the world congress of Jewry.</v>

379
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 1>He proposed that the Jews and the national socialists bury the hatchet and the</v>

380
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp inmates would be handed over to the Red Cross just a few days</v>

381
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

382
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.660
<v Speaker 1>He had given orders that no camp survivors were to fall into enemy hands and no</v>

383
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 1>camps were to be surrendered.</v>

384
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 1>His about face was clearly a matter of expediency in and attempts to minimize</v>

385
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 1>the ire of the allies when they discovered the horrors that have been taking</v>

386
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 1>place under his watch.</v>

387
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.763
<v Speaker 1>Three days later,</v>

388
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 1>him the held talks with the Swedish diplomat counter full could burn a dotake.</v>

389
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

390
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 1>He presented a surprising office saying that's in order to save Germans from the</v>

391
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.460
<v Speaker 1>full force of a Russian invasion.</v>

392
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.070
<v Speaker 1>He was prepared to surrender the western front,</v>

393
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but not the eastern front handle.</v>

394
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 1>The believed that he could negotiate directly with President Eisenhower and</v>

395
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>wondered out loud whether he should shake the president's hand or offer him a</v>

396
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Nazi salute.</v>

397
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

398
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Himmler's clandestine visits were meant to be top secret.</v>

399
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.491
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

400
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 1>somehow they got leaked to the media runs on April the 28th for London's BBC</v>

401
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.440
<v Speaker 1>broadcasts that Himmler was claiming that Hitler was dead and that he was his</v>

402
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.080
<v Speaker 1>successor in the Berlin bunk.</v>

403
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.610
<v Speaker 1>There was monitoring the airwaves and this news,</v>

404
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:56.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

405
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:57.111
<v Speaker 1>it seemed,</v>

406
00:18:57.111 --> 00:18:58.430
<v Speaker 1>found its way to the fear up.</v>

407
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Hitler was dumbstruck.</v>

408
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.680
<v Speaker 1>He could accept betrayal from anyone else but never from his loyal him that he</v>

409
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 1>called it the most monstrous betrayal in world history and he immediately</v>

410
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>ordered him less arrest,</v>

411
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.150
<v Speaker 1>but within days Hitler,</v>

412
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.043
<v Speaker 1>he was dead.</v>

413
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.790
<v Speaker 1>The victim of his own hands</v>

414
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.421
<v Speaker 1>on May,</v>

415
00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:29.800

<v Speaker 1>Under allied occupation of British patrols spotted a group of ragged looking man</v>

<v Speaker 1>One of them were short,</v>

433
00:20:04.031 --> 00:20:05.530
<v Speaker 1>thin man with a black eye patch,</v>

434

<v Speaker 1>told them his name was Heinrich Pittson gun and then produced forged identity</v>

435
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:10.150
<v Speaker 1>papers.</v>

436
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.310
<v Speaker 1>He was dressed as an ordinary German soldier.</v>

437
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.800
<v Speaker 1>The seven men were in fact Himmler and his body guards.</v>

438
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.010
<v Speaker 1>The British guards took the group into custody and placed them in a prisoner of</v>

439
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:19.450
<v Speaker 1>war camp just outside of Bremen.</v>

440
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It didn't take long for the proud Himmler to chief under the common treatments</v>

441
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that he was receiving as merely a captured soldier.</v>

442
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.471
<v Speaker 1>After a few days,</v>

443
00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:30.010
<v Speaker 1>he requested in an audience with the camp commander expecting to be treated with</v>

444
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:30.940
<v Speaker 1>newfound dignity.</v>

445
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Hemler announced his true identity,</v>

446
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but rather than being respected for his position as the Nazi number two man,</v>

447
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.740
<v Speaker 1>his captors treated him with contempt.</v>

448
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.580
<v Speaker 1>He was forced to stripped completely and as captains of 24 hour watch to prevent</v>

450
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>differentt derogation in mouth.</v>

451
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>He had secrets it as an MP with poison which had been issued tool top Nazis and</v>

452
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 1>which they always carried with them.</v>

453
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 1>A body search was ordered and when the doctor tried to examine him in his mouth,</v>

454
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.220
<v Speaker 1>he bit down on the ampule.</v>

455
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 1>The enraged British tried desperately to clear the poison from his system,</v>

456
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>but it was no good within 12 minutes,</v>

457
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.240
