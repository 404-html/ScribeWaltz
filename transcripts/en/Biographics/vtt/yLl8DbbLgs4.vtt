1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>He is the epitome of pure,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>unadulterated evil.</v>

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>The mastermind gallery with the swastika on his forehead and the wild,</v>

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>crazy look in his eyes.</v>

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>He is responsible for one of the most heinous crimes of all time controlling his</v>

6
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>minions like puppeteer and this week's biographics.</v>

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>We're looking into the dark and disturbing story of Charles Manson.</v>

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Charles Mills Manson was born on November the 12th 1934 to 16 year old Kathleen</v>

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Maddox and the 24 year old tranzians labor known only as Colonel Scott.</v>

11
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen was a promiscuous teenager who drank tea margins and money to fuel</v>

12
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>their habits by selling her body.</v>

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>The baby always known as new name Maddix for the first few weeks of life until</v>

14
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>his mother seemed to settle on Charlie.</v>

15
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>He never knew his father.</v>

16
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>He cleared out as soon as he heard the Kathleen was pregnant.</v>

17
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen was too young,</v>

18
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>too immature and unpredictable to provide a stable environment for a young</v>

19
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>She appeared to have new maternal instincts and would leave the trial to fend</v>

21
00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>for himself while she went off on one of our vendors as an adult.</v>

22
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Charlie often related to that.</v>

23
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:16.960
<v Speaker 1>His mother was once in a cafe with him on her knee when the waitress offered to</v>

24
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>buy the baby from her.</v>

25
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen's asking price once a pitcher of beer and having consumed it,</v>

26
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 1>she's simply walked out and left Charlie to the woman.</v>

27
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.931
<v Speaker 1>According to Charlie,</v>

28
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>has uncle took four days to track him down and had him home.</v>

29
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>When Charlie was six years old,</v>

30
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>his mother and uncle decided to rob a gas station.</v>

31
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.383
<v Speaker 1>They were both caught,</v>

32
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>convicted and sent for five years to Moundsville state prison.</v>

33
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>The boy was putting into the cat of is strictly religious grandparents,</v>

34
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>but after a few months he went to live with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia.</v>

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>The environment's was very different to many things.</v>

36
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Shawnee had previously known his arms on like his sister was regimens is and</v>

37
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>

38
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>She was also strictly religious.</v>

39
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Her husband's bell was even more for heaven's in his faith and his wife,</v>

40
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>a strict disciplinarian.</v>

41
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>He considered jolly to be a sissy.</v>

42
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>On the first day of school,</v>

43
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>he said the boy to class in a dress in order to teach him how to fight.</v>

44
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's seem to adapt it to this very different kind of life and actually grew</v>

45
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>to enjoy his new regimented routine.</v>

46
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>The two years between six and eight would prove to be some of the most stable of</v>

47
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>his young life,</v>

48
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but then his mother was released from prison and immediately took him back.</v>

49
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen was more unstable than ever.</v>

50
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>She preferred a life of promiscuity and alcohol abuse to baton all domestic</v>

51
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

52
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.480
<v Speaker 1>constantly in trouble with the law ends with no money for food and board.</v>

53
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>They constantly moved around the Midwest or the age of nine trolley.</v>

54
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>He dropped out of school.</v>

55
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>The transient life that he was forced to live shapes the type of boy that</v>

56
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Charlie would become.</v>

57
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>He kept to himself living his life through his imagination.</v>

58
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 1>He was constantly watching,</v>

59
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>taking things in and dreaming of a future free of.</v>

60
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no hope.</v>

61
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Mother.</v>

62
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>He also learns how to become a very accomplished thief as age nine Charlene was</v>

63
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>caught stealing and sent to reform school.</v>

64
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Three years later he was caught again.</v>

65
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>This time he was packed off to the Jib old school for boys in Indiana before he</v>

66
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.131
<v Speaker 1>was taken away.</v>

67
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen promise to to visit him often.</v>

68
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course they,</v>

69
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>she never did.</v>

70
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Just 10 months into his incarceration,</v>

71
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>jolly escapes,</v>

72
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>he robbed a grocery store to get some money and went that run out.</v>

73
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>He stole other things including a bicycle.</v>

74
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>He got caught in the act of making off with the bike and soon found himself back</v>

75
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.654
<v Speaker 1>and confinements.</v>

76
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>This time he was sent to Indiana juvenile center.</v>

77
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>That's after just two days.</v>

78
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>He stole some cutters and it's free and not any himself.</v>

79
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>There's 30 other boys this time he escaped.</v>

80
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Young Fella installed motorbike bike,</v>

81
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but rather a car,</v>

82
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but the 13 year old could hardly see over the steering wheel and was apprehended</v>

83
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>within hours of his escape.</v>

84
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>When he ended up in juvenile court,</v>

85
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>he was surprised to see his mother.</v>

86
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>His spirits were dashed.</v>

87
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:37.781
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

88
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>when she testified that she would not take him out of the somewhat sympathetic</v>

89
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>judge since Charlie to Father Flanagan's boys town,</v>

90
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>but the state here,</v>

91
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it was almost a short as his last incarceration.</v>

92
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>After just four days,</v>

93
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>he ran off with another young offender,</v>

94
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Blackie Nelson.</v>

95
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They stole a car which they subsequently crashed.</v>

96
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Still they made that weighs in the hammock black.</v>

97
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:56.591
<v Speaker 1>He's uncle Lee,</v>

98
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>World War II veteran,</v>

99
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>and an underworld figure who gave the young hoodlums free board and food in</v>

100
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>exchange for the proceeds from armed robberies that he happened commit during</v>

101
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>that third robbery.</v>

102
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>The two boys were caught this time at Shawnee was sent to the Indiana school for</v>

103
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>boys in Plainfield.</v>

104
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

105
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>he stayed for three years.</v>

106
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Charlie would lead to claim that his small statue led him to being constantly</v>

107
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>raped and sodomized by other inmates as well as by the school employees.</v>

108
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>He also recalls that he was constantly picked on by the gods who would</v>

109
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>continually find fault with him beating him with leather straps and toured and</v>

110
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.794
<v Speaker 1>clubs.</v>

111
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.833
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

112
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>One night after being gang raped by a group of older boys.</v>

113
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:41.430
<v Speaker 1>He beat one of his attack is do just short of the point of death with an iron</v>

114
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>bar as the boy lay sleeping.</v>

115
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Charlie then placed the iron bar under the banner of one of the other attackers</v>

116
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.540
<v Speaker 1>successfully implicating him in the attack.</v>

117
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Johnny was exhibiting a trait that would characterize his personality as an</v>

118
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

119
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>This was that he would hold his anger in for a time only for it to explode later</v>

120
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 1>in an orgy of violence.</v>

121
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Over the three years he spent at Plainfield,</v>

122
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Charlie escapes no less than 18 times.</v>

123
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.310
<v Speaker 1>He was returned every time though and in March of 1951 his sentence was</v>

124
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:11.370
<v Speaker 1>increased and he was sent it to a minimum security institution.</v>

125
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>This was the national training school for boys in Washington DC.</v>

126
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Here things were very different to what Charlie had known at Plainfield.</v>

127
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.490
<v Speaker 1>The facility was well run.</v>

128
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:24.840
<v Speaker 1>The boys were treated well and say genuine focus was placed on rehabilitation.</v>

129
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Charlie liked at that,</v>

130
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>but he had to no interest in being rehabilitated.</v>

131
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.603
<v Speaker 1>He'd do his time,</v>

132
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.330
<v Speaker 1>but then it would get back out to the life of crime that he knew was waiting for</v>

133
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

134
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 1>At around the age of 15 Charlene was given a psychiatric assessments.</v>

135
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.150
<v Speaker 1>He was found to be aggressive,</v>

136
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>antisocial and illiteracy.</v>

137
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.150
<v Speaker 1>The case worker reported that the boy was severely emotionally traumatized and</v>

138
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:47.550
<v Speaker 1>in serious need of psychiatric treatments.</v>

139
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It was also noted that he has a higher than normal aptitude for music.</v>

140
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I would say with the 24th of 1951 Charlie was transferred to the national bridge</v>

142
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.700
<v Speaker 1>on a camp in Petersburg,</v>

143
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

144
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Three months later,</v>

145
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>just weeks before his parole hearing,</v>

146
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>he sodomized and other inmates while holding a razor blade to his neck.</v>

147
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>He was reclassified as extremely dangerous and transfer to a tougher high</v>

148
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>security facility.</v>

149
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>The federal reformatory at Petersburg,</v>

150
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

151
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>After seven months of the federal reformatory,</v>

152
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Charlie had racks up eight major violations.</v>

153
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>He was classified as defined the homosexual,</v>

154
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and safe only under supervision with assaultive tendencies.</v>

155
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end of 1952 he was sentenced to a higher security facility still.</v>

156
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 1>That's at the surprise of everybody.</v>

157
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>He transformed into a model prisoner.</v>

158
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>He took lessons in reading and math and began working in the vehicle maintenance</v>

159
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>department.</v>

160
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 1>On January the first 1954 he was given a Meritus service award for his</v>

161
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>scholastic achievements.</v>

162
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>His application to his studies and does a parent change of attitude led to</v>

163
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Charlie being paroled.</v>

164
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 1>On May the eighth 1954 he was put into the care of his aunt and uncle,</v>

165
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.800

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Recently released from prison.</v>

168
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Six months after his release,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Charlie married a waitress by the name of Rosa Gene Willis.</v>

171
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

172
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.430

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Charlie worked as a low income job or augmenting his pay by stealing cars.</v>

175
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>He used one of those stolen cars to me of his wife and baby to Los Angeles.</v>

176
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.220
<v Speaker 1>The car had been taken from Ohio and the authorities were able to track it down.</v>

177
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It was charged with a federal crime for taking the car across state lines.</v>

178
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.640
<v Speaker 1>He was given five years probation,</v>

179

188
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 1>He was now extending his criminal earning potential by becoming a pimp.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He had a 16 year old girl working for him.</v>

196
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.170
<v Speaker 1>he was picked up and returned to Los Angeles to face a 10 year sentence for</v>

204
00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.030
<v Speaker 1>That's Mcneil Island.</v>

205
00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:25.740
<v Speaker 1>He also became obsessed with the Beatles.</v>

206
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Charlie has an inflated appreciation of his own musical talents,</v>

207
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:33.660
<v Speaker 1>claiming that he would with the right backing and training be even bigger than</v>

208
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:34.380
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles.</v>

209
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Shawnee became friends with an inmate by the name of Alvin carpets.</v>

210
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 1>This former public enemy number one was a former member of the infamous Ma</v>

211

<v Speaker 1>Barker gang.</v>

212
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.670
<v Speaker 1>He told Charlie how to play the steel guitar.</v>

213
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Speaker 1>This further fueled his musical obsession and in 1966 Charlie's prison record</v>

214
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.350
<v Speaker 1>knows is that he spent most of his free time writing songs.</v>

215
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It cumulating 80 or 90 of them in a single competence.</v>

216
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Later commented on the Charlie that he knew at that time.</v>

217
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>He recalled that Manson was a master manipulator of other people,</v>

218
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.061
<v Speaker 1>prison authorities.</v>

219
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:03.241
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

220
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 1>he noted that he had a tremendous drive to call attention to himself.</v>

221
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1966 Charlie was sent once against Tom and Leiland.</v>

222
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>This time in preparation for early release.</v>

223
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>When the day arrived on March the 21st 1967 he had spent more than half of his</v>

224
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>32 years behind bars.</v>

225
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 1>He requested that the authorities let him stay in jail,</v>

226
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but he was told that he had to leave</v>

227
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.350
<v Speaker 1>and so it was that the five foot nothing drifter with the penetrating stare and</v>

228
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 1>gift of the Gab Wanders into the height Ashbury district of San Francisco with</v>

230
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 1>music business.</v>

231
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Jolly moves into an apartment in Berkeley and made money by panhandling.</v>

232
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Before long he had gotten to know a 23 year olds,</v>

233
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>assistant librarian at UC Berkeley named Mary Brunner.</v>

234
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.240
<v Speaker 1>He quickly one a rover and moved into our apartments and Bronto came under</v>

235
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's felons.</v>

236
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.640
<v Speaker 1>He convinced her to widen out the home.</v>

237
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Within a few months there were 18 young women living with them.</v>

238
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Charlie introduced Mary and the other girls to drugs and before long Mary had</v>

239
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>quit her job and become a devoted follower of Manson.</v>

240
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>The family was beginning to take shape with his female entourage and his guitar.</v>

241
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Charlie merged perfectly into the heady culture that was then in full bloom in</v>

242
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:17.874
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco.</v>

243
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>He refined his role as a spiritual master or guru as a prophet.</v>

244
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>He used mind control techniques to get girls to do whatever he wants it.</v>

245
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Most of the girls he gathered around him came from troubled backgrounds and</v>

246
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>suffered from insecurities that left them directly opens a Charlie's</v>

247
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>manipulations as well as breaking down their inhibitions with mind control</v>

248
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:37.441
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

249
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>He used LSD and amphetamines to control his ever expanding Horam.</v>

250
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>After about nine months living in and around San Francisco,</v>

251
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Charlie began to to spanner of the place.</v>

252
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>They're tired.</v>

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>He asserted become to overrun with African Americans and crime was rampant.</v>

254
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:52.681
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

255
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that family were doing their best to add to those crimes statistics.</v>

256
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>They stole credit cards and used counterfeit money to get what they needed.</v>

257
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>They also stole the big yellow bus and painted it black</v>

258
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.713

00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>charm to make a good impression.</v>

279
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Seeing the family were rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous it posh</v>

280
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>parties in the Hollywood hills and the late spring of 1968 beach boys drama.</v>

281
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Wilson was driving away from Malibu beach when he happened to pick up two</v>

282
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>hitchhikers.</v>

283
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>The girls were part of the Manson family and they quickly agreed to go back to</v>

284
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>his Beverly hills home.</v>

285
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 1>The three made love that afternoon and Wilson left for a recording session</v>

286
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>promising to return later to take up where they left off when Wilson written</v>

287
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>time in the early hours of the following morning,</v>

288
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>he was surprised to see that a full scale party was underway.</v>

289
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>He was greeted in the driveway by a short man with a scraggly beard who</v>

290
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>approached him,</v>

291
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 1>dropped to his knees,</v>

292
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>and began kissing his feet.</v>

293
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>The girls who Dennis had met earlier,</v>

294
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I came running out declaring this is the guy that we were telling you about.</v>

295
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 1>This is Charlie.</v>

296
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Inside his home,</v>

297
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Wilson found a 12 more women,</v>

298
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.720
<v Speaker 1>most of them topless lying around and smoking pot.</v>

299
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.681
<v Speaker 1>Manson told him,</v>

300
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but the girls were all there for Wilson's pleasure.</v>

301
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Wilson was impressed with the sway that Charlie held over the women.</v>

302
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>He welcomes the family with open arms and his home became the regular venue for</v>

303
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Charlie orchestrated orgies.</v>

304
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Wilson calls and Manson the wizard and began inviting influential showbiz</v>

305
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 1>friends do come and meet him.</v>

306
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Dennis also allowed Charlie do you anything you wanted,</v>

307

<v Speaker 1>it's Ferrari or a Rolls Royce and all the food and drink and drugs that he or</v>

308
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 1>his group he's wanted.</v>

309
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Wilson's manager became fed up with the influence and expense that</v>

310
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Manson was having on his clients and Charlie and the girls were ordered out of</v>

311
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 1>the mansion rim as well.</v>

312
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Also spreading of the children of the rich and famous being given drugs and</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just [inaudible].</v>

316
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Speaker 1>It would slam shut.</v>

317
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's planned for music.</v>

318
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Korea was also shut down.</v>

319
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>This coolest a familiar buildup of jealousy,</v>

320
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.111
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

321
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and rage that would inevitably find expression in violence.</v>

322
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Madison managed to convince the owner of a former western movie set the spawn.</v>

323
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:44.200

326
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>getting by by stealing and scavenging.</v>

327
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Jolly took to quoting the Bible.</v>

328
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>It's family members as they gathered round a bonfire during the evenings.</v>

329
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>He also interpreted Beatle songs explaining that the lyrics were directed</v>

330
00:13:57.491 --> 00:13:58.324
<v Speaker 1>towards them.</v>

331
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>He was obsessed with one song helter skelter telling his followers that the song</v>

332
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 1>in visions and apocalypse brought on by a race war of blacks killing whites.</v>

333
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The blacks would when he said,</v>

334
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but it would then sounds a Manson to lead the new world</v>

335
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.011
<v Speaker 1>for Charlie.</v>

336
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:17.311
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

337
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>the revolution was taking too long.</v>

338
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:21.450
<v Speaker 1>He wants it to happen immediately.</v>

339

<v Speaker 1>He began preparing family members for a series of actions that would precipitate</v>

340
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the black uprising.</v>

341
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.120
<v Speaker 1>The first step would be to release an album of music that would contain subtle</v>

342
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:32.640
<v Speaker 1>messages that would ferment the black revolution.</v>

<v Speaker 1>smashing his head with gun bus before shooting him twice or they go for,</v>

416
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.530
<v Speaker 1>had managed to escape out toms the art.</v>

417
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.580
<v Speaker 1>She was chased by Patricia Cranney Winkle who tackled her and stabbed her to</v>

418
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

419
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>The only remaining victim was now Sharon Tate as she lay on the lounge room</v>

420
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:37.010
<v Speaker 1>floor with a wrap arounds and actually beg to be able to live long enough to</v>

421
00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:37.844
<v Speaker 1>have a child,</v>

422
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>but a police were ignored and either Watkins or Atkins stabbed her repeatedly,</v>

423
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 1>including in the abdomen until both she and her unborn baby with debt,</v>

424
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>remembering Manson's instructions to leave a sign on the walls.</v>

425
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Atkins wrote the word pig with Tate's blood.</v>

426
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.930
<v Speaker 1>The very next day the family struck again this time the victims were Leno and</v>

427
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Rosemarie Lablanca unhappy with the messiness of the previous night's killings.</v>

428
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>This time Charlie went with the group to show them how it was done.</v>

429
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Different accounts have been given the balance,</v>

430
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>the exact happenings that night,</v>

431
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that Manson was in the house and that he orchestrated the tying</v>

432
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:13.314
<v Speaker 1>up of the couple.</v>

433
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 1>He then left with the orders that the couple be killed before leaving the words</v>

434
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:18.120
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

435
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Rise.</v>

436
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Death to pigs and helter skelter were written with the blood of the victims on</v>

437
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 1>the walls and the refrigerator door.</v>

438
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.660
<v Speaker 1>The murders caused a huge panic.</v>

439
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's the pressure was now on to solve the heinous crimes.</v>

440
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.200
<v Speaker 1>The police got nowhere until they finally linked to the Hinman murder to the</v>

441
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.490
<v Speaker 1>tailor blanket killings.</v>

442
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.880
<v Speaker 1>They knew that Bobby Beausoleil Ale had lived with a group of hippies.</v>

443
00:18:43.881 --> 00:18:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It spawn ranch,</v>

444
00:18:44.871 --> 00:18:46.910
<v Speaker 1>so they decided to pay the ranch and visit.</v>

445
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Bobby's girlfriends had told police that Charlie Manson,</v>

446
00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 1>they had bigger euro,</v>

447
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.830
<v Speaker 1>had ordered the killing of Henman.</v>

448
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

449
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.160
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence linking the group to the later murders.</v>

450
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Then in October 24 months and family members,</v>

451
00:18:57.501 --> 00:18:58.340
<v Speaker 1>including Charlie,</v>

452
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.190
<v Speaker 1>were arrested on charges of arson and his grand thefts.</v>

453
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Seasoned Atkins was also taken into custody and it was she who fast to began to</v>

454
00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:06.620
<v Speaker 1>spill the beans.</v>

455
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.080
<v Speaker 1>She brags to a cellmate of hours killing Sharon Tate,</v>

456
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 1>giving a detailed accounts since implicating Charlie as the mastermind's about.</v>

457
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.851
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

458
00:19:13.851 --> 00:19:15.440
<v Speaker 1>police interviewed a member of the streets,</v>

459
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Satan's motorcycle gang,</v>

460
00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:17.960
<v Speaker 1>who was in Madison acquaintance.</v>

461
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.100
<v Speaker 1>He told them the Manson had recently been bragging about knocking off five</v>

462
00:19:22.101 --> 00:19:22.640
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

463
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.970
<v Speaker 1>The first piece of physical evidence was the fingerprints of Patricia ran Winkle</v>

464
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.490
<v Speaker 1>that was found on Sharon Tate's bedroom door.</v>

465
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.920
<v Speaker 1>When other pieces of physical evidence were recovered,</v>

466
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 1>the police were ready to send the case to court Manson and the four people who</v>

467
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:38.330
<v Speaker 1>had committed the Tate labianca murders were found guilty and sentenced to</v>

468
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

469
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.733
<v Speaker 1>These penalties,</v>

470
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.750
<v Speaker 1>however they would never be imposed.</v>

471
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.250
<v Speaker 1>In 1972 the California Supreme Court declared the state's death penalty law</v>

472
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>unconstitutional.</v>

473
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Manson's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.</v>

474
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Charles Manson died on November the 19th 2017 of cardiac arrest having spent</v>

475
00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 1>nearly 50 years behind bars for his orchestrating of the crimes that took the</v>

476
00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>worlds in 1969 he was 83 years of age,</v>

477
