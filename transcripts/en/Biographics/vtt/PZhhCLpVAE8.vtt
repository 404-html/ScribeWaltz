<v Speaker 1>Young Donald showed the most interest in his father's business ventures as a</v>

57
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>result of Fred would sometimes take the boy onto construction sites with him as</v>

58

<v Speaker 1>he developed his own personality.</v>

59
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Donald's gains a bit of a reputation as a bully.</v>

60
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>There's parents were lacks in imposing discipline upon him.</v>

61
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.383
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

62
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the trumps neighbor Martha Burnham,</v>

63
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>came home to find the four year old Donald throwing stones at our son.</v>

64
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Dennis.</v>

65
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Donald had apparently targeted dentists as an easy mark for his venom.</v>

66
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Martha warns her son to stay away from the nasty crump boy.</v>

67
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was age,</v>

68
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Donald's was the leader of a group of young thugs.</v>

69
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>He would ride around Queens on their bicycles,</v>

70
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>anything else,</v>

71
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>insults to people and stopping to deal with other youngsters who they didn't</v>

72
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>like the look off.</v>

73
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>He was known for saying what's every one says and acting impulsively.</v>

74
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Fred's enrolled.</v>

75
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Donald's adds a private education facility in forest hills called Kew forest</v>

76
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.320
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

77
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Fred to happens to be on the board of trustees for that school.</v>

78
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>This fact seems to have emboldened Donald's in his way with behaviors taking the</v>

79
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>lead amongst a bunch of boys who were constant troublemakers.</v>

80
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.291
<v Speaker 1>He would pull,</v>

81
00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>the girls have purposely bumping into other students' desks and it's talk out of</v>

82
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>turn in class.</v>

83
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Donald's grades,</v>

84
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>they were mediocre at best.</v>

85
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>This was mainly due though to lack of application rather than lack of ability,</v>

86
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>a situation that has greatly frustrated as teachers.</v>

87
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

88
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>on the playgrounds and the sports fields,</v>

89
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>he displayed considerable ability.</v>

90
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>His favorite gym game was dodgeball.</v>

91
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>He displayed great dexterity and avoiding balls that were thrown at him and he</v>

92
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.890
<v Speaker 1>was often the last man standing outdoors.</v>

93
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He excelled at baseball.</v>

94
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>He was a talented player and a fierce competitor as a sixth grader is batting</v>

95
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

96
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Was exceptional when he came up to bat.</v>

97
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>The defending side would have to extend its field,</v>

98
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>is way out in order to handle his daunting right arm swing.</v>

99
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>One morning when he was 12 years old,</v>

100
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Donald and his friend Peter Brands jumps on the train to Manhattan.</v>

101
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Such an excursion had not been authorized by Donald's parents getting off at</v>

102
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Fifth Avenue and 53rd they spent the day scrolling through central park buying</v>

103
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:26.651
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

104
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>is it novelty stores and wandering among the homeless.</v>

105
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>One of the items that Donald purchased was a switchblade knife.</v>

106
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>It was a month later that Fred discovered the knife and the story of Donald's</v>

107
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>unauthorized trip to the city was uncovered Fred.</v>

108
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>He was outraged.</v>

109
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He finally came to the realization that Donald was out of control and that</v>

110
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>something had to be done.</v>

111
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Fred decided that his fourth son was in dire need of some external discipline.</v>

112
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>He enrolled Donald's at the rosy and military boarding school about 70 miles</v>

113
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

114
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>There would be no more comfortable living in the mansion and swelling around the</v>

115
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

116
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's and implementing this new strategy.</v>

117
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Fred acted quickly,</v>

118
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 1>not even giving his son time to say as fat wells,</v>

119
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>life was indeed vastly different.</v>

120
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>At the military school,</v>

121
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the boys were required to wear a uniform that consisted of a thick fleece,</v>

122
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:19.980
<v Speaker 1>pullover and pants and alarm woke them up early in the morning and their entire</v>

123
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.600
<v Speaker 1>day was regulated by the clock.</v>

124
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Donald's life was now completely controlled by Theodore had Tobias the hands on</v>

125
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:27.390
<v Speaker 1>school administrator.</v>

126
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Tobias was a no nonsense World War II veteran who demanded excellence from his</v>

127
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>new recruits.</v>

128
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 1>He knew that many of the boys that were sent to him with that to be toughened up</v>

129
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and to have discipline imposed upon them,</v>

130
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and he took that responsibility very seriously.</v>

131
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine,</v>

132
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:45.060
<v Speaker 1>all of this was a pretty serious shock for Donald's.</v>

133
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.870
<v Speaker 1>His initial reaction was resentments and is a natural tendency to buck the</v>

134
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

135
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>He seemed racked up a number of charges,</v>

136
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:54.840
<v Speaker 1>including not making as bad and not properly cleaning the sink.</v>

137
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

138
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>administrative.</v>

139
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Tobias saw something else in the young Trump.</v>

140
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>The boy was incredibly driven and always had a desire to be number one,</v>

141
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>realizing the bucking the system was only going to get him in deeper trouble.</v>

142
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't always began trying to follow the rules.</v>

143
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>The biggest improvement was with regard to his personal orderliness and won</v>

144
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>awards for the cleanliness of his personal area.</v>

145
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

146
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>his orderliness bordered on the obsessive winning him,</v>

147
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>the nickname Mr fastidious,</v>

148
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Donald's loud mouth Busta quieten down.</v>

149
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>As discipline was injected into a system,</v>

150
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>he became soft spoken and had an air of self confidence.</v>

151
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.040
<v Speaker 1>He developed friendships despite often being regarded as a bit cocky and</v>

152
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>bragging too much about his father's wealth.</v>

153
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Then during his senior year,</v>

154
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Donald was made a company captain.</v>

155
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>This puts him in a position that have oversight over younger boys.</v>

156
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>He inspected that personal space and was responsible for generally keeping them</v>

157
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>in order.</v>

158
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>His reputation was such that he very rarely had to raise his voice at his</v>

159
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>charges.</v>

160
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>A simple step sometimes accompanied by a raised eyebrow was enough to impart his</v>

161
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>displeasure in his position.</v>

162
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>His company caps in Trump proved himself to be an effective delegator.</v>

163
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>This develops to the extent that he would give the job of inspection of the boys</v>

164
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>under his commands to others while he returned to his room to recline on his</v>

165
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>

166
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>This practice soon came to the attention of administrative Tobias,</v>

167
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>who was less than impressed.</v>

168
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>He removed to Trump from his role as company caps in and gave him a school</v>

169
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>administrative position in stat.</v>

170
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Donald's then runs onto frame this as a promotion for his stellar job in his</v>

171
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>previous role.</v>

172
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>So following his graduation from racier at the age of 18 he enrolled at Fordham</v>

173
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>University in the Bronx to study real estate.</v>

174
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>He was determined to follow in his father's footsteps and enter the world of</v>

175
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 1>real estate developments.</v>

176
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.661
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

177
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>he was going to do it bigger and better than his old men and to do that if</v>

178
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>figured he needed a real estate degree.</v>

179
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>In 1966 after two years at Fordham,</v>

180
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Donald transferred to the University of Wharton Business College.</v>

181
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Here he was out of place while coming from a background of money,</v>

182
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have the Ivy League breeding of those.</v>

183
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 1>He rubbed shoulders with.</v>

184
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.970
<v Speaker 1>He was rough and obtuse and soon proved himself to be the proverbial round hole</v>

185
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>in a landscape of square pegs.</v>

186
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>On his first day,</v>

187
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>the lecturer asked why every student there had decided to study real estate when</v>

188
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it came to his turn.</v>

189
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Donald stood up and declared that he was going to become the king of New York</v>

190
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>City when it came to the real estate business</v>

191
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.051
<v Speaker 1>drum.</v>

192
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Graduated from Wharton in 1968 returning to New York with a degree in real</v>

193
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>

194
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.421
<v Speaker 1>At this time,</v>

195
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:28.690
<v Speaker 1>he was eligible for the draft to serve his country in Vietnam.</v>

196
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.231
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

197
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:29.471
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

198
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:30.700
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>

199
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 1>1968 physical exam resulted in a medical suspension due to bone goads in his</v>

200
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:35.560
<v Speaker 1>heels,</v>

201
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.570
<v Speaker 1>setting himself up in an apartment in Queens.</v>

202
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Trump began working for his father in early 1969 from very start,</v>

203
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 1>he fells deep seated need to prove to his father that he was a supremely</v>

204
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:47.440
<v Speaker 1>talented real estate man.</v>

205
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.990
<v Speaker 1>The Trump way of doing business was called into question.</v>

206
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 1>In 1973 when a handful of tenants took up a class action lawsuits against the</v>

207
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>company claiming racial discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act.</v>

208
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>The case was as impossible to prove.</v>

209
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

210
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and the Trump organization paid a small settlements without any admission of</v>

211
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>guilt.</v>

212
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Around this same time,</v>

213
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Donald was promoted to president of the company and his first act was to re name</v>

214
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the company.</v>

215
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>The format Elizabeth Trump and son became the Trump organization.</v>

216
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 1>One of his next moves was to hire aggressive attorney Roy Cohn.</v>

217
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Cohn had a reputation as a bulldog,</v>

218
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Goliath.</v>

219
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>If anyone dad's a farmer,</v>

220
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>suits against those who he works for,</v>

221
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>he would go out and destroy them.</v>

222
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>In 1975 Donald's,</v>

223
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

224
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Ivana,</v>

225
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Maria is they'll niche Guevara.</v>

226
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.590
<v Speaker 1>She was a beautiful sports scare who hails from Czechoslovakia or Romans.</v>

227
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.421
<v Speaker 1>Seen Blossoms,</v>

228
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>ends after a two year courtship.</v>

229
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 1>The couple were married over the next five years.</v>

230
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Ivana was given management responsibility and a number of business ventures.</v>

231
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>She also bore Trump three children,</v>

232
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Donald jr Ivanka and Eric.</v>

233
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.950
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of Fred Trump's business was centered on middle income housing</v>

234
00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Speaker 1>in Brooklyn,</v>

235
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.770
<v Speaker 1>queens and Staten Island's to Donald's.</v>

236
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.940
<v Speaker 1>This was small time.</v>

237
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.140
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to break into the large scale commercial real estate and the heart of</v>

238
00:10:05.141 --> 00:10:05.920
<v Speaker 1>the big apple.</v>

239
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.770
<v Speaker 1>He's had his sights on a project in Manhattan.</v>

240
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.990
<v Speaker 1>His target was the Commodore Hotel.</v>

241
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.830
<v Speaker 1>The commodore was a derelict to 2003 white elephants on 42nd street.</v>

242
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Trump intend to do completely remodel this into an upmarket Hyatt hotel.</v>

243
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.430
<v Speaker 1>The highest end buyer was run by the Pritzker family.</v>

244
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Despite having presences all over the states,</v>

245
00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:26.320
<v Speaker 1>they have no representation in New York,</v>

246
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but the area surrounding the commodore was extremely CD and the Pritzkers were</v>

247
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:33.400
<v Speaker 1>in need of some serious convincing for Donald.</v>

248
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.940
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

249
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.510
<v Speaker 1>the CD environments and the decrepit state of the hotel meant that he would be</v>

250
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:41.320
<v Speaker 1>able to pick up the property at a steal of a price to make the purchase.</v>

251
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.800
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

252
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.900
<v Speaker 1>he would need to borrow a lot of money.</v>

253
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.910
<v Speaker 1>The finance was secured by bank loans.</v>

254
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:49.270
<v Speaker 1>There were underwritten by both Fred Trump and the highest organisation.</v>

255
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Donald Aussie managed to secure a 40 year tax exemption on the building.</v>

256
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.040
<v Speaker 1>The renovation of the commodore and its metamorphosis into the Grand Hyatt hotel</v>

257
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.210
<v Speaker 1>proved to be a great success with Trump winning accolades from the city fathers</v>

258
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.070
<v Speaker 1>along with an award for the tasteful and creative recycling of a distinguished</v>

259
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:06.700
<v Speaker 1>hotel.</v>

260
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>The grand science projects coupled with the reflected reputation of his father,</v>

261
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.440
<v Speaker 1>established Donald's as a legitimate player in the New York commercial real</v>

262
00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:15.274
<v Speaker 1>estate markets.</v>

263
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

264
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Shortly</v>

265
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.660
<v Speaker 1>after the completion of the highest projects,</v>

266
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Trump began negotiations to develop a 58 story building on Fifth Avenue</v>

267
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.340
<v Speaker 1>adjacents to famous New York landmark Tiffany and company.</v>

268
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>This $200 million developments was to be Trump's masterpiece.</v>

269
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.100
<v Speaker 1>It would feature a six story atrium that was lined with pink marble as an 80</v>

270
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.180
<v Speaker 1>foot waterfall.</v>

271
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>

272
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.470
<v Speaker 1>House was to be Donald's personal living quarters with this officer's just below</v>

273
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.040
<v Speaker 1>the first couple of floors would then feature some of the world's most famous</v>

274
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:48.874
<v Speaker 1>retailers.</v>

275
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.630
<v Speaker 1>The building opens in 1983 and was named Trump tower.</v>

276
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It's received international attention and was attended by a number of</v>

277
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>celebrities at the same time that Donald was working on Trump tower.</v>

278
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 1>A local New York buildup was attempting to repair derelict Wollman skating rink</v>

279
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>after two and a half months.</v>

280
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 1>The work that style matters,</v>

281
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of public dissatisfaction that the ring was not reopened on</v>

282
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

283
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Then Donald interjected himself into the whole affair when he wrote a letter to</v>

284
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:18.970
<v Speaker 1>the mayor stating that he could supercharge the projects and just bring it in.</v>

285
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Well under budget.</v>

286
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>The mayor responded by calling his bluff.</v>

287
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Donald went straight to a concrete that he had a working relationship with.</v>

288
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 1>He convinced them to take the Wollman rink projects on the for free with a</v>

289
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>guarantee that the publicity it would bring would far outweigh the costs</v>

290
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

291
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>The projects when's ahead on that basis and was completed under time and under</v>

292
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 1>budget by three quarters of a million dollars.</v>

293
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 1>The publicity ans public appreciation that the woman rig project brought in was</v>

294
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

295
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>but it was all directed towards Donald Trump.</v>

296
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.430
<v Speaker 1>The contractor who had done the heavy work without payments,</v>

297
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>barely even got him mentioned.</v>

298
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 1>1980 you saw Trump moving into the gambling business.</v>

299
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 1>He acquired all of the necessary licenses and then purchased a property in</v>

300
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic city to do this project.</v>

301
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>He partners with the Holiday Inn cooperation the parent's company of harass</v>

302
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:11.704
<v Speaker 1>casinos.</v>

303
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>In 1984 the facility opens as Porras at Trump plaza.</v>

304
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 1>The casino was a great success.</v>

305
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Wetting Trump's appetite for more.</v>

306
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>He actively sought out casinos that had failed gambling licenses.</v>

307
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Finding one in the form of the Atlantic City,</v>

308
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Hilton Hotels Casino.</v>

309
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.530
<v Speaker 1>He acquired the property spending $310 million on the purchase and upgrade it</v>

310
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>later reopened as Trump castle always wanting to go one better.</v>

311
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Trump took over developments of the largest casino in the world at the time,</v>

312
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 1>the Taj Mahal,</v>

313
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.330
<v Speaker 1>the Trump Taj Mahal opens in 1990 however,</v>

314
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Trump had to go into extreme debt in order to open the doors.</v>

315
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Revenues would have to average $1 million per day in order to cover costs.</v>

316
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 1>This was simply an unheard of number and the reality was that it was never going</v>

317
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

318
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Trump indeed had to go through major bankruptcy restructuring in order to keep</v>

319
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>the casino going.</v>

320
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Eventually ending up with just a 10% ownership stake.</v>

321
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Around this same time,</v>

322
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Trump also established Trump's hotels and casino resorts,</v>

323
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:12.620
<v Speaker 1>which became a publicly traded company throughout the 1980s and nineties</v>

324
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 1>nineties from never let up on his real estate developments.</v>

325
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Despite his financial problems.</v>

326
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>In 1985 he purchased a 76 acres of western Manhattan in order to create a</v>

327
00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 1>television city complex.</v>

328
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1988 he purchased the Plaza Hotel for $407 million.</v>

329
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Then 1989 saw his first investment in Florida.</v>

330
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.370
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

331
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>he had also acquired a number of golf results across the country.</v>

332
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.790
<v Speaker 1>In 1992 Trump hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons.</v>

333
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.630
<v Speaker 1>When his affair with a 23 year old actress named Marla Maples was exposed.</v>

334
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Display Room is if on,</v>

335
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to believe truth until Marla followed the trumps on a skiing trip and</v>

336
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 1>confronted Ivana with the news that Donald was in love with her and that Ivana</v>

337
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 1>best give up on him.</v>

338
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 1>This was too much for Ivana.</v>

339
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>She filed for divorce,</v>

340
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 1>leaving maples free to marry Donald's,</v>

341
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:08.560
<v Speaker 1>which he did in 1993 they had one child together who they named Tiffany after</v>

342
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.100
<v Speaker 1>the famous New York department store.</v>

343
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.761
<v Speaker 1>The marriage,</v>

344
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.990
<v Speaker 1>though it was rocky from the start and end in divorce in 1999 ironically,</v>

345
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the proceedings were instigated by Donald's when he learns that his wife was</v>

346
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:19.694
<v Speaker 1>having an affair.</v>

347
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Donald was then associated with a number of women in the early two thousands</v>

348
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 1>back in 1998 he had met a Slovenian but by the name of Melania conops.</v>

349
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Over the next few years,</v>

350
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 1>that relationship develops at the points where Melania became Donald's constant</v>

351
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 1>companion.</v>

352
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.860
<v Speaker 1>They were engaged in 2004 and married on January the 22nd 2005 and Palm Beach,</v>

353
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

354
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:40.461
<v Speaker 1>The couples.</v>

355
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Only child baron.</v>

356
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:46.481
<v Speaker 1>William Trump was born on March the 20th 2006 on October the 21st at Trump</v>

357
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:46.821
<v Speaker 1>hotels,</v>

358
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 1>casinos and resorts restructured its death resulting in Trump's ownership.</v>

359
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:55.361
<v Speaker 1>If the company dropping from 59 to 27% the company applied for bankruptcy.</v>

360
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It reemerged as Trump entertainment resorts holdings.</v>

361
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Trump now put a premium on pushing his brands with the Trump logo being placed</v>

362
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 1>on all manner of products.</v>

363
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Even released his own game.</v>

364
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump's real estate tycoon,</v>

365
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Trump's political views,</v>

366
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:11.980
<v Speaker 1>they've undergone a metamorphosis over the years up in Zillow.</v>

367
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 1>1987 he was a democrat.</v>

368
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

369
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.691
<v Speaker 1>in that year,</v>

370
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:18.290
<v Speaker 1>he registered for the first time as a republican toying with the idea of running</v>

371
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 1>for office.</v>

372
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He placed full page ads in three papers espousing his views,</v>

373
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 1>which were that America,</v>

374
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.100
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to stop propping up other countries and start looking after it.</v>

375
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Same people.</v>

376
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.090
<v Speaker 1>In October of 1999 Trump established and exploratory panel to assess the</v>

377
00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 1>viability of his running for the reform party's candidate for president from</v>

378
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:39.170
<v Speaker 1>nominee in two thousands it was decided that his lack of profile on the west</v>

379
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 1>coast would be too much of a detriment.</v>

380
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>This led him to pass on the opportunity from that point onwards.</v>

381
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

382
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 1>he bided his time and it's increasingly made political comment for public</v>

383
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:49.664
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>

384
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.500
<v Speaker 1>In 2003 Trump ventured into the world of reality television when he became the</v>

385
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:02.410
<v Speaker 1>executive producer and star of the apprentice.</v>

386
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.580
<v Speaker 1>The show in which contenders go through a series of challenges do you when a job</v>

387
00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:09.280
<v Speaker 1>has Trump's apprentice was a huge success.</v>

388
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It propelled Donald Trump to worldwide recognition status in one and a star on</v>

389
00:17:13.391 --> 00:17:17.770
<v Speaker 1>the Hollywood walk of fame from reentered the political arena in 2001 when he</v>

390
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:21.490
<v Speaker 1>raised questions about the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's birth</v>

391
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:22.090
<v Speaker 1>certificates.</v>

392
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 1>He doggedly held to this view despite Obama's insistence that he was born on us</v>

393
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 1>soil.</v>

394
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.990
<v Speaker 1>He's serious and he considered running for the top office again in 2012 but</v>

395
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.550
<v Speaker 1>again decided that the time wasn't right.</v>

396
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Then on June the 16th 2015 he famously announced from Trump plaza that he would</v>

397
00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:42.130
<v Speaker 1>be throwing his hat into the ring for the Republican nomination for president in</v>

398
00:17:42.131 --> 00:17:47.131
<v Speaker 1>2016 few people to come seriously but serious he was and history will record him</v>

399
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>for better or as the 45th president of the United States.</v>

400
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.990
