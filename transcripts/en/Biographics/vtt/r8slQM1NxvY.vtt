<v Speaker 1>He is one of the most popular and enduring icons over the American West,</v>

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the gentleman bandit,</v>

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker 1>charmed his way through life,</v>

4
00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>always keeping one step ahead of the law with this fabled wild banshee,</v>

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>terrorize the banks and the railway companies during the closing decade of the</v>

6
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Then he headed south of the border only to meet his match at the hands of</v>

8
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Bolivian treats.</v>

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics graphics,</v>

10
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>we delve into the life and the death of butch cassidy.</v>

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Leroy Parker was born in beaver use R on April the third,</v>

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>It was named after his grandfather who helps lead a group of Mormon handcart</v>

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>refugees thousands of miles across the country to the Utopia that was Utah.</v>

16
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Traveling along the Mormon trail.</v>

17

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>They headed into the snow drifts of the continental divide.</v>

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Robert Parker senior was a strong man.</v>

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the harsh winter.</v>

22
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>It was too much for him that he was found dead one morning frozen in his blanket</v>

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 1>policy forged on and often many trials.</v>

24
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>They made it to Utah Pollock,</v>

25
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:23.870

27
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.890

29
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Don Campbell.</v>

30
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>The couple would go on to have 13 children together.</v>

31
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Robert known as Bob.</v>

32
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>He was the oldest.</v>

33
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Max polica became a successful businessman when Bob was a young child.</v>

34
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>His father purchased a ranch 12 miles south of Circleville and to move the</v>

35
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>family that they employed,</v>

36
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>a number of cowboys including a petty criminal by the name of Mike Cassidy</v>

37
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.451
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy.</v>

38
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>He took a shine to young Bob who appeared to idolize these swaggering outlaw.</v>

39
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>He told the boy he has a shoot,</v>

40
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.691
<v Speaker 1>a gun ride,</v>

41
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:57.231
<v Speaker 1>a horse,</v>

42
00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>rope and brands,</v>

43
00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>and Russell Castle.</v>

44
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Bob was a good study and by the time he was 16,</v>

45
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>he had developed a reputation as a fine,</v>

46
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>shortens a competent horseman.</v>

47
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>He developed into a solid,</v>

48
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.500
<v Speaker 1>strapping teenager with a pleasant and jovial personality.</v>

49
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>There is not a lot known about butches later teen years.</v>

50
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.690
<v Speaker 1>It appears that he took work as a rancher in various locations until 1884.</v>

51
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.960
<v Speaker 1>At one point he gains work as a butcher in rock springs,</v>

52
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming.</v>

53
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>It was at this time that he took the nickname.</v>

54
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Butch cassidy was a amash do you?</v>

55
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>His childhood hero,</v>

56
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Mike Cassidy Cassidy's first run in with the law occurred around 1880.</v>

57
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to buy some food and some clothes,</v>

58
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>but found the shop to be closed on detail.</v>

59
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Z simply broke in and took a pair of jeans as well as a pipe.</v>

60
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

61
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>he also left an Iou note indicating that he would return to settle his account</v>

62
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:49.514
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

63
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.061
<v Speaker 1>The shopkeeper,</v>

64
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>though he was not impressed and he had butcher arrested.</v>

65
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>The case ended up before the courts were.</v>

66
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Jury acquitted him</v>

67
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.213
<v Speaker 1>in</v>

68
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>1999.</v>

69
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>A 23 year olds.</v>

70
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Butch cassidy turns up in telluride,</v>

71
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>

72
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>located in the San Juan Mountains.</v>

73
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Telluride was a wild mining town full of gold.</v>

74
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Hungry prospect is the place was filled with saloons,</v>

75
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>gambling houses and brothels.</v>

76
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Sitting right smack in the middle of town was the San Miguel Valley Bank.</v>

77
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy,</v>

78
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>he teamed up with a fellow drift,</v>

79
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>a by the name of Matt Warner,</v>

80
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>and the two were joined investors in a race horse named betty.</v>

81
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>The money for that investment came through cattle rustling.</v>

82
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.030
<v Speaker 1>They then decided to set their sights a little higher determining to rob the</v>

83
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>local bank.</v>

84
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It is believed that they robbed the stage in Denver prior to the bank heist.</v>

85
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>They then made a show of spending money liberally around telluride in order to</v>

86
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>show that they were not desperate men on the morning of June,</v>

87
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>the 24th,</v>

88
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

89
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>89 cassidy,</v>

90
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>warner and two accomplices,</v>

91
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 1>one who is believed to have been Harry longer bob best known as the Sundance</v>

92
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

93
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>hitch the horses outside of the livery store in telluride and then headed for a</v>

94
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>saloon not far from the San Miguel Valley Bank just prior to noon.</v>

95
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>They noticed one of the tellers exit the bank,</v>

96
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.420
<v Speaker 1>leaving just one man on duty to have the Alamo's cabs,</v>

97
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>God outside,</v>

98
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>while the other two went to the bank,</v>

99
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and amazingly none of the robbers bothered to wear a mask or otherwise conceal</v>

100
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:14.854
<v Speaker 1>his identity.</v>

101
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>History also does not reveal the role that each individual plate.</v>

102
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.130
<v Speaker 1>We do know though that one of the men who went into the bank approach the loan</v>

103
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>tatler and told him that he wanted to cash a check when the man began to inspect</v>

104
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>the track has had,</v>

105
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>was grabbed and shoved into the desk at this point,</v>

106
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>so the two outside came in and for began ransacking the bank in such a money,</v>

107
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>they go away with more than $20,000 on the way out of town.</v>

108
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy and one over recognize by two men still.</v>

109
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>They managed to get away hiding out in a remote area of southeastern Utah,</v>

110
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>known as robber's roost.</v>

111
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>This would become a favorite place of escape.</v>

112
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>The cassidy and his gang,</v>

113
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>who builds cabins there and catch this stone and cattle horses and weaponry in</v>

114
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>this area.</v>

115
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy used some of the profits from that bank job to buy a ranch near Dubois,</v>

116
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming.</v>

117
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>In 1894,</v>

118
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>he began a relationship with a teenage girl by the name of Anne Bassett,</v>

119
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>who was the daughter of a wealthy cattle rancher for four years after the San</v>

120
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.813
<v Speaker 1>Miguel Valley bank robbery.</v>

121
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Butch managed to live the life of a law abiding citizen.</v>

122
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

123
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>shortly after becoming involved with and he was arrested for horse stealing,</v>

124
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>his trial took place in Monza,</v>

125
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming.</v>

126
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Guns resulted in his conviction and sentence to two years imprisonment at the</v>

127
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming state penitentiary and Laramie.</v>

128
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy proved to be a model prisoner.</v>

129
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>He applied to the Wyoming governor for a Audi release.</v>

130
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 1>This was agreed on the condition that he would stay out of trouble in the</v>

131
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

132
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Butch,</v>

133
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.131
<v Speaker 1>he agreed,</v>

134
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>but he had no intention of following through on that promise.</v>

135
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Immediately upon his release on January the 19th,</v>

136
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:42.461
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

137
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>96,</v>

138
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>he rejoined his gang.</v>

139
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>That's an area of their robin's roost hideaway,</v>

140
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>known as the hole in the wall.</v>

141
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It was following butches release from Wyoming state penitentiary that he and his</v>

142
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>wild bunch gang began their crime spree and honest.</v>

143
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.301
<v Speaker 1>The gang was in,</v>

144
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>launched more than 30 members with a core of such notables as the Sun Dawns Kid,</v>

145
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.191
<v Speaker 1>kid curry,</v>

146
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>and I was a lay on the afternoon of August the 13th,</v>

147
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

148
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.511
<v Speaker 1>96,</v>

149
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>three men in Montpellier,</v>

150
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Idaho.</v>

151
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>They dismounted in front of the bank and then to have them pulled that bandannas</v>

152
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>over their faces,</v>

153
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>the bend quickly pulled out that revolvers and the two wearing bandanas.</v>

154
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>How did the men into the bank inside were a number of customers and bank</v>

155
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:26.744
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

156
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyone except for one of the cashiers was ordered to line up against the wall.</v>

157
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the rabbids who is believed to have been cassidy kept his gun trained on</v>

158
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>the terrifying customers while another filter bags with cash,</v>

159
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>gold and silver that before leaving with that $7,000,</v>

160
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but cassidy or did the people to wait for 10 minutes before raising the alarm.</v>

161
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>The Robo who had remained downside bald makes was the only one who did not cover</v>

162
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>his face.</v>

163
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 1>He was recognized by the town residents and ended up being one of only three</v>

164
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:54.141
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

165
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It was captured and convicted of the crime.</v>

166
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy was well known in Utah,</v>

167
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>runs as a result,</v>

168
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>as a general rule of not committing crimes in that state.</v>

169
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.211
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

170
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>in April of 18,</v>

171
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>97 be made an exception to that rule.</v>

172
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>His target was the payroll of the Pleasant Valley Coal Company and cost gate.</v>

173
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>This was the largest coal mine in Carbon County,</v>

174
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Utah.</v>

175
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

176
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>it was ideally located between the gangs favorite high downs of robbers roost</v>

177
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 1>and Brown's hole.</v>

178
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>The company knew that that payroll was an enticing prize for bandits,</v>

179
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>and so they tried to prevent heists by keeping irregular paydays.</v>

180
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 1>The payroll came in on a train that was heavily guarded.</v>

181
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Butch decided there's going off against the train,</v>

182
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:31.461
<v Speaker 1>was too risky,</v>

183
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 1>and so he did tell him and take the money directly from the payment stuff in</v>

184
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:36.650
<v Speaker 1>order to do so high for the gang,</v>

185
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:39.590
<v Speaker 1>would need to know when the payroll was going to arrive.</v>

186
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>On April the 17th cassidy road into the town of castle gate and went to one of</v>

187
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>the saloons were inquired if there was any work going for a run hand.</v>

188
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 1>He was told that the might be if he was patient enough with his excuse for</v>

189
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 1>hanging around now established.</v>

190
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 1>He made his way to the train depot.</v>

191
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.430
<v Speaker 1>He watched the goings on as the train came and wins,</v>

192
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>and then returned to the saloon for the next week.</v>

193
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>He repeated this process,</v>

194
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>observing every train that came into town on April the 22nd cassidy's patients.</v>

195
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>It was finally rewarded a whistle from the mine,</v>

196
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>announced that it was payday.</v>

197
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>When the train arrived,</v>

198
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>butch watched from a distance is the paymaster fit.</v>

199
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.671
<v Speaker 1>Coffins.</v>

200
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Aaron's,</v>

201
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>a couple of aides,</v>

202
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>carried money bags from the train to his office.</v>

203
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.961
<v Speaker 1>The bags were heavy.</v>

204
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>You containing more than $7,000 in gold and I have a $100 in Silva,</v>

205
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.260
<v Speaker 1>so the men were going slowly then just as a ready decline.</v>

206
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>The stands for the paymasters office.</v>

207
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Calvin's a was approached from behind and a revolver was poked into its rips.</v>

208
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Butch informs him that he was about to relieve him and his pals of their load.</v>

209
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Adding the did hate to have to shoot any of them.</v>

210
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Competency was stunned that such a brazen attack would be attempted in broad</v>

211
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:46.334
<v Speaker 1>daylight.</v>

212
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 1>There were plenty of miners arounds,</v>

213
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>but very few of them spoke English or would have been aware of what was going</v>

214
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

215
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Gang member Elza lay and the from the shadows and helps butch take possession of</v>

216
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>the moneybags coffins that and his helpers,</v>

217
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.350
<v Speaker 1>left them to it,</v>

218
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>seeking protection in the nearby Howard West.</v>

219
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>All the paymaster then began yelling out that had been robbed.</v>

220
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Cassidy and lay attempted to mount their horses well stealing the money and that</v>

221
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>saddlebags if a butcher,</v>

222
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 1>his horse got spooked and took off,</v>

223
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>leaving him standing in the middle of the street with a bag of gold in his hand,</v>

224
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>lay managed to track the horse down and bring it back to the two,</v>

225
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>and they made away with over $7,000 in gold.</v>

226
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>They left the bag of silver just lying in the street.</v>

227
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Payments to compensate and out sprang into action.</v>

228
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>He ran for the Telegraph office,</v>

229
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>instructed the to send an urgent message to the authorities in price,</v>

230
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>which was some 10 miles away.</v>

231
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.111
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

232
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the clerk told him the lines had been cut thinking fast.</v>

233
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>He made for the train and told the driver to hightail it to price.</v>

234
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>As the train chugged along,</v>

235
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>it went right past the fleeing Roberts.</v>

236
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It took several hours before the sheriff.</v>

237
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It price could get a posse organized.</v>

238
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>In addition to having this headstart,</v>

239
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>butch was also very familiar with the countryside and was easily able to evade</v>

240
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 1>as as local ranches.</v>

241
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>We're also happy to provide his gang with fresh horses,</v>

242
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>having no loyalty to the big mining companies or indeed the banks constantly in</v>

243
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:03.031
<v Speaker 1>Lei.</v>

244
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>They made it a bag so that base had robber's roost where they lay low with the</v>

245
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>other gang members.</v>

246
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.020
<v Speaker 1>The officials in Utah were well aware of where the robbers were,</v>

247
00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>but showed no enthusiasm for going after them.</v>

248
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>As a result of the local papers began to accuse the lawman of cowardice for</v>

249
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>three months,</v>

250
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 1>butch and his men spend their time drinking,</v>

251
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>gambling and horse riding.</v>

252
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Then when the boredom was too much,</v>

253
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 1>they decided to go out and start spending that takings.</v>

254
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>They ranged around buying fine clothes,</v>

255
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>getting hack accounts,</v>

256
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>and spending up launch in the saloons and the brothels.</v>

257
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>By the end of June 19,</v>

258
00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:41.711
<v Speaker 1>97,</v>

259
00:10:41.711 --> 00:10:44.830
<v Speaker 1>it was time to get back to the business of robbery.</v>

260
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.470
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who said that science on the town of Belle fourche,</v>

261
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:48.670
<v Speaker 1>north of black hills.</v>

262
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.810
<v Speaker 1>On June the 28th,</v>

263
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Butch send gang member Tahmo day to scout out the town.</v>

264
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.810
<v Speaker 1>The plan was to rob the bank once a day had gotten back,</v>

265
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.590
<v Speaker 1>however the day managed to get himself drunk and didn't return to camp until it</v>

266
00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:00.121
<v Speaker 1>was 40.</v>

267
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Relate an angry butch had to delay the heist for 24 hours.</v>

268
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:04.601
<v Speaker 1>The next day,</v>

269
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Butch selected the Sun Don skid along with George Curry.</v>

270
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Walter put me and Tomo Day to do the job.</v>

271
00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:11.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the Butte county bank.</v>

272
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.290
<v Speaker 1>The three men followed the usual procedure.</v>

273
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Drawing their revolvers is enforcing the customers to stand along the wall with</v>

274
00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:18.610
<v Speaker 1>their hands in the APP.</v>

275
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.820
<v Speaker 1>However possible.</v>

276
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I saw this through the window and they raised the alarm.</v>

277
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Chaos erupts it on the streets.</v>

278
00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:26.770
<v Speaker 1>There's people rush to get off the street while others went for that.</v>

279
00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Guns,</v>

280
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the bandits inside,</v>

281
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:31.120
<v Speaker 1>they quickly realized that they had been found out.</v>

282
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:31.960
<v Speaker 1>They rushed out,</v>

283
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.710
<v Speaker 1>firing their guns in the air and attempting to get away a couple of towns.</v>

284
00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:37.450
<v Speaker 1>People returned fire from behind.</v>

285
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.231
<v Speaker 1>Cover good.</v>

286
00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Carrie was unable to get to his horse,</v>

287
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:42.640
<v Speaker 1>so trying to mountain mule only to discover that it wouldn't move.</v>

288
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.300
<v Speaker 1>As the other two rode out of town,</v>

289
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Tom O'day attempted to steal away into a side street,</v>

290
00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:50.620
<v Speaker 1>but it was caught and held overnight and the local bank vaults before being</v>

291
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>transported to the jail and deadwood the very day the robbery had been an</v>

292
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>unmitigated disaster.</v>

293
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.770
<v Speaker 1>It had cost the gang a valued member and earns them just $97 leaving behind</v>

294
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>$3,000</v>

295
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and the early morning hours of June,</v>

296
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the second 80 slash 99,</v>

297
00:12:13.011 --> 00:12:17.240
<v Speaker 1>the wild bunch pulled off one of the most celebrated crimes to two members of</v>

298
00:12:17.241 --> 00:12:21.260
<v Speaker 1>the gang with redlands and flags down the Union Pacific overlands flyer train</v>

299
00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:24.140
<v Speaker 1>just outside of the Willcox station and Wilcox,</v>

300
00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming.</v>

301
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.850
<v Speaker 1>The driver thought the two men were warning him that the driving rain has washed</v>

302
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:30.110
<v Speaker 1>out and approaching bridge.</v>

303
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.110
<v Speaker 1>He threw on the brakes and bring the train to a screeching halt,</v>

304
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.150
<v Speaker 1>but what is all of the men had guns drawn.</v>

305
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 1>He realized the truth and began running down the track to want to come and</v>

306
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.800
<v Speaker 1>drains to back off the bandaid can go and jumps onto the train where they</v>

307
00:12:42.801 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Speaker 1>ordered the engineer to pull the train into a nearby trestle on the far side of</v>

308
00:12:46.761 --> 00:12:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the bridge.</v>

309
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Once the train had crossed over,</v>

310
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the bandits lit the fuse to stash of dynamite,</v>

311
00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:53.150
<v Speaker 1>which had been placed on the bridge.</v>

312
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.020
<v Speaker 1>The bridge was damaged enough that the second drain would be unable to follow</v>

313
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the train engineer then,</v>

314
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.700
<v Speaker 1>or did the train forward another two miles where the rest of the gang we're</v>

315
00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:02.330
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

316
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.200
<v Speaker 1>The robbers then made their way to the express call.</v>

317
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I need to find out that the god see he wasn't going to open the door,</v>

318
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>so they decided to let me say,</v>

319
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.490
<v Speaker 1>but with dynamize,</v>

320
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>this Russell,</v>

321
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:11.671
<v Speaker 1>the god,</v>

322
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that he couldn't remember the combination to the safe so well,</v>

323
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the robbers blue,</v>

324
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.960
<v Speaker 1>that open as well.</v>

325
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.200
<v Speaker 1>The result was that all the cash went flying everywhere,</v>

326
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.460
<v Speaker 1>still the gang managed to get away with more than $50,000 worth of cash,</v>

327
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.960
<v Speaker 1>gold and jewelry.</v>

328
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.070
<v Speaker 1>The robbery made national headlines and brought the wild bunch to the attention</v>

329
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.990
<v Speaker 1>of the nation's premier crime fighters,</v>

330
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.620
<v Speaker 1>the Pinkerton Detective Agency for the next two years,</v>

331
00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:38.870
<v Speaker 1>the pinkertons doggedly tracked down the gang.</v>

332
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.591
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

333
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:42.440
<v Speaker 1>the policy was formed to chase down the train robbers.</v>

334
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.880
<v Speaker 1>They caught up with a three bandits.</v>

335
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.780
<v Speaker 1>On June the sixth,</v>

336
00:13:44.781 --> 00:13:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that Castle creek a gun battle ensued in which kid car he shot and killed the</v>

337
00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:50.060
<v Speaker 1>sheriff leading the posse.</v>

338
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.450
<v Speaker 1>The posse members then with drew is the outlaws escaped.</v>

339
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Butch Cassidy was north of the rough and tumble molds,</v>

340
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 1>most of his contemporary outlaws where he was an extremely sociable man who was</v>

341
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.260
<v Speaker 1>a great conversationalist.</v>

342
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>We're not engaged in criminal activity.</v>

343
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey impressed others with his strong work ethic.</v>

344
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.171
<v Speaker 1>By 18,</v>

345
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:14.681
<v Speaker 1>99,</v>

346
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 1>he had a thriving ranch in Dubois,</v>

347
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:16.841
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming,</v>

348
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and it was growing tired of the outlaw life.</v>

349
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.170
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of that year,</v>

350
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>he visited the office of Attorney Orlando Powers in Ogden,</v>

351
00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Utah.</v>

352
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>He explained to the attorney that he had been portrayed as a vicious criminal</v>

353
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 1>when in fact he has never hurt anybody and it only have a role,</v>

354
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but for large corporations,</v>

355
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:32.831
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

356
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Then jd powers do approach the governor on his behalf seeking an amnesty deal.</v>

357
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>The lawyer responded that a deal was extremely unlikely and the best thing that</v>

358
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>butch could do was to go back into hiding.</v>

359
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Undeterred.</v>

360
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Butch sought out another attorney.</v>

361
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>This time the meeting was arranged with Utah.</v>

362
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Governor Abbott Wells.</v>

363
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Wells was impressed by cassidy and told him this.</v>

364
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 1>As long as there were no outstanding murder warrants for him,</v>

365
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>he was sure that amnesty could be arranged.</v>

366
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 1>The second meeting was arranged which butcher attended in full confidence.</v>

367
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 1>He was surprised to learn however that the governor's office had uncovered and</v>

368
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>outstanding murder warrants in his name.</v>

369
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Butch protest is that it never killed a man in his life.</v>

370
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to.</v>

371
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Though the governor responded,</v>

372
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 1>the charge was enough.</v>

373
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.373
<v Speaker 1>Immense.</v>

374
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Amnesty was simply out of the question</v>

375
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>with the failure of his attempt to go straight.</v>

376
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 1>It seems that butch carried out a string of further robberies around the turn of</v>

377
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:31.994
<v Speaker 1>the century.</v>

378
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't have been linked to a train robbery in Tipton,</v>

379
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming in August of 1900 and the winner mark in Nevada bank heist a month</v>

380
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.351
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

381
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:43.430
<v Speaker 1>though there is no concrete evidence that they took part with no prospects to</v>

382
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>end is fugitive life in the west,</v>

383
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 1>which began making plans to head south of the border when he proposed the idea</v>

384
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:49.600
<v Speaker 1>to his gang members.</v>

385
00:15:49.601 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Seventy two were interested the sundance kid and could carry before the gang</v>

386
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.531
<v Speaker 1>split up for good.</v>

387
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It's five core members out of final rendezvous in Texas.</v>

388
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Also having their fill of liquor,</v>

389
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>fine dining and women.</v>

390
00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 1>They sat for a group photograph in new suits.</v>

391
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>The photo that was taken on that day made its way to the Pinkerton detective</v>

392
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>agency and it was used on wanted posters.</v>

393
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Butch and Sundance then split up promising to meet up again in New York City.</v>

394
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.260
<v Speaker 1>This they did with Sundance being accompanied by his longtime girlfriend at a</v>

395
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

396
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>The trio boarded the ship bound for when our series on February the 20th,</v>

397
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>1,901</v>

398
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.500
<v Speaker 1>immediately upon arrival books using the assumed name of Jim Rohn deposit of</v>

399
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.930
<v Speaker 1>$12,000 in a local bank is the first step and putting up a land claim.</v>

400
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.580
<v Speaker 1>They ended up purchasing 17,000 acres of lands and shall Lilo to their</v>

401
00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:45.001
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>

402
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:46.440
<v Speaker 1>There appeared to be hardworking,</v>

403
00:16:46.441 --> 00:16:49.290
<v Speaker 1>gringos z except for one disturbing facts.</v>

404
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Wherever they went,</v>

405
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.230
<v Speaker 1>they wore that guns.</v>

406
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Butch and Sundance said,</v>

407
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.090
<v Speaker 1>presumed that a move out of the country would bring it in to that pursuit by the</v>

408
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.953
<v Speaker 1>pinkertons,</v>

409
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but they were mistaken.</v>

410
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Robert Pinkerton,</v>

411
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.840
<v Speaker 1>the head of the agency sends a letter to the [inaudible] police chief with</v>

412
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.030
<v Speaker 1>descriptions and photos of the dealer.</v>

413
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.130
<v Speaker 1>The local police identified them as the two ranches who always wore guns around</v>

414
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.740
<v Speaker 1>cello.</v>

415
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.230
<v Speaker 1>They attempted to keep it close surveillance on the man,</v>

416
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.330
<v Speaker 1>so all the pinkertons arrived and apprehended them.</v>

417
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.530
<v Speaker 1>The two animals would spend seven years in Argentina before the law finally</v>

418
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:21.270
<v Speaker 1>caught up with them for the first five years.</v>

419
00:17:21.271 --> 00:17:22.800
<v Speaker 1>They kept that noses clean.</v>

420
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Blending in with the locals and becoming popular members.</v>

421
00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:25.551
<v Speaker 1>Of the trinity,</v>

422
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 1>low community.</v>

423
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Then for some reason they returned to a life of crime in the spring of 19.</v>

424
00:17:30.541 --> 00:17:30.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

425
00:17:30.631 --> 00:17:31.140
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

426
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.250
<v Speaker 1>They teamed up with another American fugitive and Robin to the bank and Mercedes</v>

427
00:17:35.251 --> 00:17:37.200
<v Speaker 1>getting away with $20,000.</v>

428
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.860
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

429
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the three robbers shot and killed a bank teller.</v>

430
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.753
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

431
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.100
<v Speaker 1>butch and sundance were on the run</v>

432
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.053
<v Speaker 1>on November the sixth.</v>

433
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>It was made their way to send the incentive.</v>

434
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>

435
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 1>they were put up in the spare room of a local villager.</v>

436
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

437
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>a local official identified them and notified members of the Bolivian cavalry.</v>

438
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 1>The room were butch and sundance were holed up with surrounded.</v>

439
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of versions as to how the last moments played out.</v>

440
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 1>The most accepted version is that sun don't sprint it out onto the patio in a</v>

441
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:13.110
<v Speaker 1>desperate attempt to get some rifles.</v>

442
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.090
<v Speaker 1>These were located by an outside wall.</v>

443
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay was firing his revolvers into the errors of distraction as he ran.</v>

444
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

445
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 1>he was cut down before he made it off.</v>

446
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 1>The patio.</v>

447
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Butch ran out after him and dragged is mortally wounded.</v>

448
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Friends back inside,</v>

449
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>sustaining at least one wound in the process.</v>

450
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>After pouring masses of lead into the building and hearing one silence from</v>

451
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 1>within the Bolivian troops finally made their way inside.</v>

452
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 1>They found the bodies of the two outlaws lying on the floor.</v>

453
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Sundance had been shot several times in the arms and once in the forehead,</v>

454
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 1>while butch had a bullet hole in the temple,</v>

455
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers is in fudge that books should put his best friend out of his misery</v>

456
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 1>before turning the gun on himself.</v>

457
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.011
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

458
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:53.280
<v Speaker 1>there was never an inquest and the two men were never formally identified.</v>

459
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 1>The most wanted men in America was simply buried in unmarked graves.</v>
