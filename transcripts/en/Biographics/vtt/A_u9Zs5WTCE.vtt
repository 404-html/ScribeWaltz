00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>In the collective memory of the People Diana,</v>

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Princess of Wales was everything rolls should be.</v>

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>She was beautiful,</v>

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>composed and full of compassion for those in need,</v>

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.661
<v Speaker 1>and when did she died?</v>

6
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>In 1997.</v>

7
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>It was a horrific tragedy that shook the world.</v>

8
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>She had been robbed of a future that was looking incredibly bright and our sons</v>

9
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>would forever be without a mother,</v>

10
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>but the dark secrets of Diana's life proved this.</v>

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>All that glitters is not gold.</v>

12
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that her death was no accidents and there was actually an</v>

13
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:32.481
<v Speaker 1>elaborate conspiracy designed by the royal family to silence in the biographics</v>

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>video today we look at Diana Princess of Wales.</v>

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Dan was born on July the first 19,</v>

16
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>61 to John and Francis Spencer.</v>

17
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It had been a tradition for members of the inability to marry one another for</v>

18
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>centuries and her parents were no exception.</v>

19
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Together with her two older sisters and two brothers,</v>

20
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>they lived in a mansion called Park House in north England.</v>

21
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

22
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Diana grew up with the best things that money could buy and she went on play</v>

23
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>dates with children in the royal family,</v>

24
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>but all of the money in the world can't buy happiness drawn in Francis.</v>

25
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>They had a toxic marriage mold her life.</v>

26
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.690
<v Speaker 1>His parents never said,</v>

27
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I love you to one another or indeed to their children.</v>

28
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 1>They pushed off most of the parental duties.</v>

29
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Do Nannies or governesses at age nine,</v>

30
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>her father sent her to boarding school.</v>

31
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Her mother remarried to a man called Peter Shand kid,</v>

32
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>who was the ad who is successful wallpaper company.</v>

33
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Her father married a woman named rain mccorquodale,</v>

34
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>who was the daughter of a famous romance novelist.</v>

35
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>The children,</v>

36
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>they weren't present at their second fall,</v>

37
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.341
<v Speaker 1>this marriage,</v>

38
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>and they have to find out about it through the newspaper.</v>

39
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Diana to siblings deeply resented rain as an evil stepmother and blames half a,</v>

40
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.250
<v Speaker 1>tearing the family apart.</v>

41
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Diana was a shy girl and she struggled in school.</v>

42
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>She was labeled as the thick one by her family and this was enough for her to</v>

43
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>ends up crying in school.</v>

44
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Every time she got a bad grade,</v>

45
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>deep down,</v>

46
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>all she really wanted was to be loved and accepted for who she was and dreamed</v>

47
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>of a prince who was going to take her away so she could live happily ever after.</v>

48
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>When she was just 16 years old,</v>

49
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Diana met Charles the Prince of Wales for the first time.</v>

50
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>He was 29 and dating her older sister Sarah.</v>

51
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between Sarah and Charles,</v>

52
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>it never went anywhere,</v>

53
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>so they went their separate ways.</v>

54
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

55
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Charles said that Diana made a big impression on him because he thought she was</v>

56
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>very cheerful and beautiful when she came of age.</v>

57
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:32.901
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>

58
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I could have chosen to party like a socialite or travel the world with a family</v>

59
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.051
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

60
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but when she was eating,</v>

61
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>she chose the very normal life of working as a kindergarten teacher.</v>

62
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>She used her paychecks to Sharon apartment with a few friends that I loved</v>

63
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>taking care of children,</v>

64
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>and it made her very happy to give them the love and the encouragement that she</v>

65
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>never got as a little girl at that time,</v>

66
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Diana was filled with a lot of hope about our future.</v>

67
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>She said that she felt this deep sense of destiny and one day she would grow up</v>

68
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>to do great things.</v>

69
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Prince Charles had been dating several women over the years,</v>

70
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.291
<v Speaker 1>including Camilla,</v>

71
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Rosemary Shan's.</v>

72
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Camilla was not wife material in the eyes of the Queen,</v>

73
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>so she married a multimillionaire named Andrew Parker Bowles.</v>

74
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Charles and Camilla never actually broken off that relationship and they</v>

75
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>continued having a secret affair the entire time that she was married.</v>

76
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Charles was now in his thirties and under lots of pressure from his mouth as he</v>

77
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>settled down and produce an APP,</v>

78
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>he needed a wife that was a member of the aristocracy and Diana had all of the</v>

79
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>qualifications of a perfectly acceptable bright off going on.</v>

80
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Only 13 dates.</v>

81
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Charles proposed to Diana when she was a belly legal 18 year old,</v>

82
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>even though they hardly knew one another to nfl,</v>

83
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>says the becoming the princess was the sense of destiny that she had been</v>

84
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>waiting for all along a couple of weeks after their engagement.</v>

85
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>The couple was interviewed by the press.</v>

86
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end of the reporters said that they were very much in love.</v>

87
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.923
<v Speaker 1>Dan replied,</v>

88
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

89
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Charles Loft saying whatever in love means watching the tape.</v>

90
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You can clearly see that Diana was heartbreaking and later interviews,</v>

91
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Diana defines that instance,</v>

92
00:04:03.351 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>is the moment she knew that marrying him would be a huge mistake.</v>

93
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.430
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

94
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>the entire world had their eyes on her and she knew it was her duty to go</v>

95
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>through with the marriage.</v>

96
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Even to this day diner and Charles still go down in history for having one of</v>

97
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>the most expensive weddings.</v>

98
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Experts estimate that today that wedding would cost anywhere from 70 to</v>

99
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000.</v>

100
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>From the perspective of the people watching the wedding on tv,</v>

101
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a dream come true.</v>

102
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Diana later said it was the West staff.</v>

103
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.234
<v Speaker 1>My life.</v>

104
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The honeymoon was on the royalty entrepeur Tanya,</v>

105
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>

106
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>and reportedly spent most of the time sleeping in 1982.</v>

107
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Charles and Diana had been married for less than a year and she had already</v>

108
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>discovered Charles is secret relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.</v>

109
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>He started to gaslight her saying that she was paranoid.</v>

110
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.250
<v Speaker 1>This made half so devastated that she threatened to kill herself.</v>

111
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Joel is ignored her and started to leave to go on a horseback trip.</v>

112
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Diana threw herself down the stairs.</v>

113
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 1>The Queen rushed our aid screaming for a doctor while will love the attendance</v>

114
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>around at the princess.</v>

115
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Joel's just kept on walking to the outside world.</v>

116
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>The marriage between Diana and Charles seemed like a fairytale that comes to</v>

117
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>life for the first time.</v>

118
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>People around the world were fascinated and invested in the royal couple.</v>

119
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The Massa,</v>

120
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>what was going on behind closed doors.</v>

121
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>She had to smile,</v>

122
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>wave and just pretend that everything was fine.</v>

123
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Diana was still just a teenager when she was put under pressure by the media to</v>

124
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 1>be this perfect princess combined with a healthy marriage.</v>

125
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It was enough to make a spiral into a deep depression and she became.</v>

126
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>She had so much empathy for other people.</v>

127
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:40.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a particularly difficult meeting,</v>

128
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>visiting the pole sick and we Beta mental health a lot worse.</v>

129
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Instead of recognizing that she needed help,</v>

130
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Diana was treated like a child throwing a Tantrum and the royal family just</v>

131
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>continued to ignore her issues.</v>

132
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 1>William was born when Diana was 20 years old,</v>

133
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 1>just barely out to that teenage years.</v>

134
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>She was to raise the future king that's a William Reuter loss of joy and purpose</v>

135
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>to our life during interviews.</v>

136
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 1>That press would mostly ignore how while they spoke with Charles,</v>

137
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>asked Diana how the baby was doing,</v>

138
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>even though this was actually very demeaning to Diana's face,</v>

139
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>would light up and she would gush about how much fun she was having with him.</v>

140
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Even officer giving birth to the.</v>

141
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Our relationship with our husbands remains coles and distance.</v>

142
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>She eventually decided that if she was going to be stuck in an unfaithful</v>

143
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

144
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>she would have an effect too.</v>

145
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>When she was 23,</v>

146
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Donna fell in love with a cavalry officer named James Hewitt.</v>

147
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>They went together about a year before how second some Harry was born in</v>

148
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>pictures showing the two of them side by side.</v>

149
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It is easy why people believe that James Hewitt might actually be Prince Harry's</v>

150
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>biological father.</v>

151
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>This is such a popular theory that it was even turned into a stage play that was</v>

152
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:48.100
<v Speaker 1>performed on the west end.</v>

153
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Diana pushed Charles to be more involved in raising the boys instead of relying</v>

154
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>totally on Nannies.</v>

155
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>When the boys were old enough to go out,</v>

156
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>she made sure they had normal experiences like waterparks,</v>

157
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.341
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's,</v>

158
00:06:58.341 --> 00:06:59.174
<v Speaker 1>and shopping.</v>

159
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>She also brought them to homeless shelters to pass out hot tea and food.</v>

160
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.253
<v Speaker 1>Prince Charles,</v>

161
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>he scoffed at these ideas and asking why all of that was necessary when she was</v>

162
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>

163
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Diana fell in love with her bodyguards.</v>

164
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Barry Maliki.</v>

165
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>They became best friends and she felt very safe around him.</v>

166
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>April's lots of joy to our life,</v>

167
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but Diana claims that they never actually crossed the line.</v>

168
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.101
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

169
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>most people still consider this to be an emotional affair or at the very least,</v>

170
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>once their friendship was revealed.</v>

171
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Prince Charles Five Medicaid,</v>

172
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.991
<v Speaker 1>no long enough to anything.</v>

173
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>His job at the royal palace sparing anarchy was killed in a motorcycle accident.</v>

174
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Charles and Diana were on their way to the con film festival in France when he</v>

175
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 1>told her the news.</v>

176
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Charles mentioned many death so casually.</v>

177
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It was as if he was talking about the weather.</v>

178
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Diana wanted to cry there.</v>

179
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>She knew that within a few moments you would have to step out of the car and to</v>

180
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>be photographed by hundreds of people,</v>

181
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>so she had to put on that smile once again and just pretend like nothing was</v>

182
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

183
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.933
<v Speaker 1>She and I just said,</v>

184
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I think he was bumped off,</v>

185
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.433
<v Speaker 1>but we'll never know.</v>

186
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Diana felt that if she did not escape the marriage,</v>

187
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>she really might want to take her own life.</v>

188
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 1>She knew that her only hope of getting a divorce would be to get the public on</v>

189
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:03.614
<v Speaker 1>her side.</v>

190
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that she decided to speak with a journalist named Andrew</v>

191
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Morton about the truth of the dysfunctional household motion.</v>

192
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Eventually published her biography called a Diana.</v>

193
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Her true story in her own words,</v>

194
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in history,</v>

195
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:19.610
<v Speaker 1>the public got a glimpse into the life of a royal marriage,</v>

196
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>says certainly wasn't prissy.</v>

197
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Charles responded by being interviewed for a documentary in 1994 called trials</v>

198
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:27.321
<v Speaker 1>the private man,</v>

199
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>the public role where he admitted he had an affair with Camilla,</v>

200
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:31.154
<v Speaker 1>Parker Bowles.</v>

201
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Lana responded by doing an interview on BBC Panorama in 1995.</v>

202
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>During this interview,</v>

203
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>she said that she believed Charles was not a good person and he wasn't even fit</v>

204
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>to become the next king of the United Kingdom.</v>

205
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>She believed that her son,</v>

206
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>William would do a much better job serving the people Diana said of herself that</v>

207
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't go quietly saying that's the problem.</v>

208
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight to the end.</v>

209
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Diana and Charles were separated for years and seeing other people off to the</v>

210
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.660
<v Speaker 1>bickering back and forth in the media.</v>

211
00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:08.590
<v Speaker 1>The Queen herself demanded that they needed to officially get divorced.</v>

212
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.670
<v Speaker 1>In 1995,</v>

213
00:09:09.671 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Diana began dating and Egyptian millionaire named dirty Fiat is falling though</v>

214
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.600
<v Speaker 1>was the owner of these successful Harrods department store runs,</v>

215
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.090
<v Speaker 1>has the net worth of one point $6,000,000,000,</v>

216
00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.280
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is far richer than the queen.</v>

217
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Charles and Diana were officially divorced in 1996.</v>

218
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Jobs would eventually go on to marry his longtime girlfriend is going to the</v>

219
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>pocket bowls even after leaving.</v>

220
00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:34.981
<v Speaker 1>Her position is Princess of Wales at wanted to continue her destiny by making a</v>

221
00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.070
<v Speaker 1>difference to the world.</v>

222
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.080
<v Speaker 1>She was pretty terrible at public speaking,</v>

223
00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:41.530
<v Speaker 1>which really was necessary during charity events and public appearances,</v>

224
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.160
<v Speaker 1>so she started to receive vocal lessons from a former actor named Peter</v>

225
00:09:45.161 --> 00:09:48.910
<v Speaker 1>settlement during the lesson settled and set up a camera to record her progress</v>

226
00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:51.280
<v Speaker 1>and you asked her questions about her personal life.</v>

227
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.310
<v Speaker 1>These became much needed therapy sessions for her.</v>

228
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.430
<v Speaker 1>She revealed secrets about her marriage and the royal family through these</v>

229
00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.720
<v Speaker 1>lessons with sas alone,</v>

230
00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:02.740
<v Speaker 1>and she was able to find her own voice and learn to thrive as a public speaker</v>

231
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.730
<v Speaker 1>after her death.</v>

232
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.210
<v Speaker 1>These tapes were confiscated by the royal family and the public were not able to</v>

233
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:08.800
<v Speaker 1>see them until years later.</v>

234
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:09.701
<v Speaker 1>Diana,</v>

235
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:13.250
<v Speaker 1>she became a traditional celebrity without the benefit of royal security.</v>

236
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:16.810
<v Speaker 1>The you continued to follow her and write about her in the tabloids.</v>

237
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Instead of allowing the press do you only write about her hair and fashion</v>

238
00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:20.861
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>

239
00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 1>she decided to make the best of being in the spotlight by getting involved in</v>

240
00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:28.520
<v Speaker 1>causes that matter tat she raised awareness about the aids epidemic and travel</v>

241
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:32.650
<v Speaker 1>to several African countries to fight for the ends of landmines and public</v>

242
00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:33.370
<v Speaker 1>spaces.</v>

243
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the most famous photographs of her was with a young amputee who had had a</v>

244
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:41.020
<v Speaker 1>leg blown off almost immediately after getting the attention of the press,</v>

245
00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the laws,</v>

246
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.870
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

247
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.670
<v Speaker 1>landmines.</v>

248
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.503
<v Speaker 1>They were changed.</v>

249
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.051
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

250
00:10:44.051 --> 00:10:46.180
<v Speaker 1>this was making lots of politicians unhappy.</v>

251
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.420
<v Speaker 1>They said that she was getting involved in issues that she didn't fully</v>

252
00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:54.160
<v Speaker 1>understand how response was that she really didn't care she was going to fight</v>

253
00:10:54.161 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>for the people and not the politicians instead of wilting into quite obscure.</v>

254
00:10:59.011 --> 00:10:59.200
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

255
00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Diana,</v>

256
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:00.783
<v Speaker 1>she was thriving.</v>

257
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.310
<v Speaker 1>She was no longer depressed.</v>

258
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.790
<v Speaker 1>She was glad to trade her title for a life of freedom.</v>

259
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.600
<v Speaker 1>She auctioned off all of our designer gowns and gave millions to charities that</v>

260
00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:12.040
<v Speaker 1>she cared about all of this,</v>

261
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and you made the public love her more and she was still a princess in the hearts</v>

262
00:11:16.211 --> 00:11:17.044
<v Speaker 1>of the people.</v>

263
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Often her divorce was finalized.</v>

264
00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Diana was dating an Egyptian man named doody fired.</v>

265
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 1>He was a multimillionaire.</v>

266
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.550
<v Speaker 1>He lived a very glamorous life,</v>

267
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.190
<v Speaker 1>pepper add,</v>

268
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.120
<v Speaker 1>see took photos of them on vacations around the world,</v>

269
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Speaker 1>the British press schools in a playboy and write negative connotations about the</v>

270
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:38.380
<v Speaker 1>fact that he was Muslim.</v>

271
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.250
<v Speaker 1>He was actually a successful movie producer who was best known for the Oscar</v>

272
00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:44.410
<v Speaker 1>winning movie starring Robin Williams.</v>

273
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.830
<v Speaker 1>It was also the RTD multibillion dollar Harrods department store.</v>

274
00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Fortunate.</v>

275
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.180
<v Speaker 1>The two of them were very much in love and they plans on Sunday getting married.</v>

276
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Some even believe that Diana may have been pregnant with his child.</v>

277
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.160
<v Speaker 1>If this was true,</v>

278
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 1>it would have cost a lot of issues for the royal family.</v>

279
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.100
<v Speaker 1>The idea that William and Harry,</v>

280
00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:02.770
<v Speaker 1>you could have a Muslim half sibling.</v>

281
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It was unacceptable.</v>

282
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 1>She was also threatening to reveal more and more secrets about the royal family</v>

283
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.050
<v Speaker 1>to the press or charity work as well.</v>

284
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It often interfered with money making schemes among the inability indeed she</v>

285
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 1>even received death threats on a regular basis.</v>

286
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Not long before her death.</v>

287
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Diana wrote a letter to a Butler saying that she believed her ex husband Charles</v>

288
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>was trying to have are killed in a car accident.</v>

289
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 1>She also cold duties.</v>

290
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Father Mohammed all fire engines told him the same thing.</v>

291
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.960
<v Speaker 1>On August the 31st 1997 dirty Fiat and Diana were being driven through Paris on</v>

292
00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:35.750
<v Speaker 1>that named Henri poll,</v>

293
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 1>just as they entered the alma tunnel.</v>

294
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:38.970
<v Speaker 1>They were apparently running from pepper,</v>

295
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 1>etsy and ended up in an accident.</v>

296
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.033
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

297
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 1>every single one of the security cameras inside the tunnel just so happens not</v>

298
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 1>to be working that day.</v>

299
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So there is no recording showing exactly what happens.</v>

300
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.460
<v Speaker 1>According to witnesses,</v>

301
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 1>the car went into a pole at 65 miles per hour and no one was wearing a seatbelt.</v>

302
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 1>On September the sixth,</v>

303
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:57.911
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

304
00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:58.500
<v Speaker 1>97.</v>

305
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.900
<v Speaker 1>The streets of London where lines with people moaning,</v>

306
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Princess Diana's death.</v>

307
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Millions do.</v>

308
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 1>You didn't watch the funeral procession on TV.</v>

309
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>They're all cortel to trial and found that the crash was simply an accident.</v>

310
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

311
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>everyone present at that trial was obligated,</v>

312
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>decide with the royal family and that findings.</v>

313
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Many people think they were totally biased.</v>

314
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.321
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

315
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 1>in 1999,</v>

316
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the French government also investigated the car crash and they came to the same</v>

317
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:23.074
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>

318
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It was simply an accident.</v>

319
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

320
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 1>in 2008 and new independent investigation found that the driver Henri Pool had</v>

321
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 1>been drinking heavily that day and the original trial had failed to mention that</v>

322
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.570
<v Speaker 1>they also concluded pepper add,</v>

323
00:13:35.571 --> 00:13:36.404
<v Speaker 1>see vehicles.</v>

324
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

325
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>tailgating the calm,</v>

326
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 1>the jury concluded that Henri Paul was responsible for the deaths and that if he</v>

327
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:42.881
<v Speaker 1>was still alive,</v>

328
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 1>he would be convicted of meme set.</v>

329
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>For some,</v>

330
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 1>this investigation was not enough and one of those people was Dodi's.</v>

331
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Father Mohammed are fired.</v>

332
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>He had spent years of his life struggling with racism while running his</v>

333
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:54.191
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

334
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and he was disgusted by how the media is portraying Dodi,</v>

335
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:59.360
<v Speaker 1>even though he was a victim to Mohammad.</v>

336
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 1>All five claims that he had evidence for 175 separate conspiracy theories and</v>

337
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 1>paid for a documentary called unlawful killing to cover them all.</v>

338
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in this video we call him go too deep into all of the conspiracy</v>

339
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:11.501
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>

340
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough for the British government to ban the documentary from being</v>

341
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:16.840
<v Speaker 1>seen in the United Kingdom.</v>

342
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>According to these conspiracy theories,</v>

343
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Henri Paul was actually sober that day because the receipts from the hotel</v>

344
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>showed that he only had two drinks at dinner and had gone through a medical exam</v>

345
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 1>by security beforehand.</v>

346
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>He had actually outrun the pepper ratzy and mysterious wide Fiat,</v>

347
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:32.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.510
<v Speaker 1>followed them into the tunnel with a group of motorcycles.</v>

349
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Some believe that these were on my six agents who were being paid by the</v>

350
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>government to kill her.</v>

351
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 1>After inspecting the cola,</v>

352
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 1>they discovered that the seatbelts and honorary pols car had been tampered with,</v>

353
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 1>which is why no one was wearing them.</v>

354
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It also took over an hour and a half for the ambulance to get to the hospital</v>

355
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 1>even though they were very doctors,</v>

356
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:55.160
<v Speaker 1>believe that if Diana was wearing his seat and into gotten medical attention</v>

357
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 1>sooner,</v>

358
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>she would've survived.</v>

359
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

360
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 1>without videotape of the crash,</v>

361
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:03.890
<v Speaker 1>we may never know the whole truth of the circumstances surrounding her death</v>

362
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:04.521
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

363
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Princess Diana,</v>

364
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 1>she's not truly gone because she lives on in Prince William and Prince Harry's</v>

365
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.460
<v Speaker 1>legacy because of her.</v>

366
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 1>They both do charitable work and they married for love instead of finding a mate</v>

367
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.250
<v Speaker 1>inside of the royal family,</v>

368
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 1>and we're sure that if she could see them today,</v>

369
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 1>she would truly be proud.</v>

370
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.430
