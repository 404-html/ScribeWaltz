1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.211
<v Speaker 1>Or the age of seven,</v>

2
00:00:01.211 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>and Helen Keller was described by family members as a little monster.</v>

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>She threw temper tantrums,</v>

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>attacked,</v>

5
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>meant a terrible personal habits.</v>

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Yet within a year,</v>

7
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>the deaf and blind girl had been transformed.</v>

8
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>She became teachable.</v>

9
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That teaching on top to level of genius and determination which saw her overcome</v>

10
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>her disability and achieve unimaginable success.</v>

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

12
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>we explore how Helen Keller beat incredible odds to become a true inspiration to</v>

13
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.064
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

14
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Helen Keller was born on June the 27th,</v>

15
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:40.701
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

16
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>80 in Tuscumbia,</v>

17
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>a small town in northern Alabama.</v>

18
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>She was a perfectly healthy baby with the ability to see and hear how mother</v>

19
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Kate's just 23 years old was the pampered southern Belle who doted on her first</v>

20
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>child's.</v>

21
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.293
<v Speaker 1>Helen's father,</v>

22
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.761
<v Speaker 1>author,</v>

23
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:53.991
<v Speaker 1>Ray,</v>

24
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>confederate veteran of the civil war was 42 when his daughter was born.</v>

25
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Case was his second wife and he had two grown sons from his first marriage.</v>

26
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>The birth of Helen was a relief to Katie and now had a child of our own to</v>

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>shower love and attention.</v>

28
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Upon Alan was it quick developer speaking her first words at six months and</v>

29
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>taking her first steps on a fest birthday.</v>

30
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

31
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>in February 18,</v>

32
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>82 at the age of 19 months,</v>

33
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>she became severely ill with what doctors at the time called brain fever.</v>

34
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Modern researchers believed that she may have had scarlet fever or possibly</v>

35
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>meningitis,</v>

36
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever the cause of her illness.</v>

37
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>The local doctor was convinced that the child would not survive.</v>

38
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Alan did survive,</v>

39
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but the illness have rubbed.</v>

40
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Our river herring and test site have bright happy world was now filled with</v>

41
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>silence and darkness as an adult Helen records coming out of her illness.</v>

42
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I was too young to realize what happens when I awoke and found that it was dark</v>

43
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>and still I suppose I thought it was nice and I must have wondered why David was</v>

44
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>so long coming gradually,</v>

45
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

46
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I got used to the silence and darkness that surrounded me and forgot that it had</v>

47
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>ever been day for the first few months after her illness,</v>

48
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>a terrified helen would do no more than sit in their mother's lap and kings who</v>

49
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>are dressed as kate tried to do her daily chores.</v>

50
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Then she began to venture out on their own,</v>

51
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>first crawling around the room and feeling her way forward.</v>

52
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>She discovered that her hands could in a small way,</v>

53
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>do the job of our eyes helping her to identify objects and different areas of</v>

54
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>the house with Kate's patient assistance.</v>

55
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Helen also developed a crude system of communication,</v>

56
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>a shake of the head for no one's and nod for yes,</v>

57
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I pull on her mother's dress for come before long,</v>

58
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>she had incorporated pantomime actions.</v>

59
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And do you have vocabulary?</v>

60
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>If she wanted ice cream,</v>

61
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>she would pretend she was working the freezer aisle while shivering.</v>

62
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.471
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

63
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>attentive mother would then rushed to give her whatever she wants it.</v>

64
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Helen proved to be very determined.</v>

65
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Child,</v>

66
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>if she sets her mind on the task,</v>

67
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>she would keep at this until she wants successful.</v>

68
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>At greatest desire was to improve our ability to communicate with others,</v>

69
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>making simple signs with our hands was simply not enough.</v>

70
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the inability to people understand what she was thinking and feeling led</v>

71
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>to a level of frustration,</v>

72
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but wells deep insight up this lead to violent outbursts of temper,</v>

73
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>including screaming fits and even violence.</v>

74
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.603
<v Speaker 1>Al bests.</v>

75
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Helen's temper tantrums.</v>

76
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>They terrorize the family.</v>

77
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>She would smash landon's thrust her fist in plates of food and pinch whoever was</v>

78
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.764
<v Speaker 1>close by.</v>

79
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Relatives referred to the child as a monster and strongly urged and offer to put</v>

80
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>her into an institution.</v>

81
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.501
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

82
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.150
<v Speaker 1>85,</v>

83
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>kate had a second child,</v>

84
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>mildred baby sister for Helen with my mother's doting attention now being</v>

85
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>shared,</v>

86
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Helen became intensely jealous.</v>

87
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Ones she knocked over mildred's,</v>

88
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>caught causing the baby to fall out.</v>

89
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Desperate case was an absolute wit's ends,</v>

90
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>unable to control or help helen anymore.</v>

91
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

92
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>she remains determines not to send her away.</v>

93
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.890
<v Speaker 1>When Helen was six,</v>

94
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I father learned of a doctor in Baltimore,</v>

95
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Maryland's named Julian Krystle.</v>

96
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>He would help to restore sight to blind people.</v>

97
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>The family took the trip to consult with Dr Chris on only to be told that there</v>

98
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>was nothing medically that can be done to fix helen's eyesight,</v>

99
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but the doctor did hold out a ray of hope.</v>

100
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>He told the colors of autumn man,</v>

101
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>who specialized in helping deaf children to communicate his name.</v>

102
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It was Alexander Graham Bell,</v>

103
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>although today he is best remembered as the inventor of the telephone.</v>

104
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.521
<v Speaker 1>Bells.</v>

105
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Passion was actually helping the death.</v>

106
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Belle's mother and wife.</v>

107
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>We're both death.</v>

108
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.931
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

109
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:17.591
<v Speaker 1>he had met his wife,</v>

110
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Mabel when he had taken on the job.</v>

111
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's have private tutor teaching her through a system of signing that he had</v>

112
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.480
<v Speaker 1>developed the Kellers.</v>

113
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It decided to travel to Washington in order to meet him.</v>

114
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Helen felt comfortable with belt right away,</v>

115
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>but that first meeting,</v>

116
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>he sat her on his knee and his handler,</v>

117
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.983
<v Speaker 1>his pocket watch.</v>

118
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>She was delighted with the vibrations that she felt when the watch struck.</v>

119
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>The our bell suggested the Kennedys ranked to the Perkins Institute for the</v>

120
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Blind in Boston requesting a tutor for Helen,</v>

121
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>the institute that trains teachers so you could go out and work with deaf and</v>

122
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:45.844
<v Speaker 1>blind students.</v>

123
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>The director of the institute looked over the list of recent graduates settling</v>

124
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>upon his star pupil,</v>

125
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>a 20 year old who was herself partially blind from suffering Tacoma as a child.</v>

126
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Her name was Anne Sullivan</v>

127
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 1>and Sullivan arrived at the Keller House on March the third,</v>

128
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.741
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

129
00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:04.460
<v Speaker 1>87.</v>

130
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Helen's stood in the doorway as she approached the child,</v>

131
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 1>knew you from her mother's scurried activities that morning,</v>

132
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:10.880
<v Speaker 1>but something important was happening,</v>

133
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't yet know what the most important day I remember in all my life is</v>

134
00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:18.650
<v Speaker 1>the one in which my teacher and Mansfield Sullivan came to me.</v>

135
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Helen could hear footsteps approaching,</v>

136
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.830
<v Speaker 1>assuming it was a mother.</v>

137
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 1>She held her hand and took the girl's hand and pulls her in for an embrace,</v>

138
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>but when Helen realized that this was a stranger,</v>

139
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>she struggled to break free.</v>

140
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 1>This was the first of many temper outbursts that and would be confronted with.</v>

141
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>The very next day in a fit of rage,</v>

142
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the students knocked out one of our teachers from Tif,</v>

143
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.470
<v Speaker 1>but Helen was quick to realize the Miss Sullivan was not about to let the</v>

144
00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 1>petulant child get away with outrageous behavior,</v>

145
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.920
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been happening up until then when the breakfast table and hadn't reached</v>

146
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 1>across to grab food from Anz plate that she was accustomed to doing with family</v>

147
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:55.130
<v Speaker 1>members and grabs her hands and pushed it away.</v>

148
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.211
<v Speaker 1>This scent Helen,</v>

149
00:05:56.211 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>into a fit of she flopped on the floor and exhibits exhibitors a full on</v>

150
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Tantrum.</v>

151
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Sullivan asked the other family members to leave the room and lock the door.</v>

152
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>She then proceeded to continue eating her breakfast,</v>

153
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>completely ignoring Holland's performance.</v>

154
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.621
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

155
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>the exasperated child got off the floor and felt friend's body to see what she</v>

156
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

157
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Why want you to discover that and was commonly eating her food.</v>

158
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>She again began to grab the plates at each time and would slap her hand away.</v>

159
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Helen then began pinching ans hand something that she was allowed to do with</v>

160
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>impunity to our family members again,</v>

161
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and slap the hand away.</v>

162
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

163
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.280
<v Speaker 1>hello.</v>

164
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Sat back on her chair and began eating her food and she seen came to the</v>

165
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>realization that Helen's family members had been enabling her behavior.</v>

166
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>She knew that's made any progress.</v>

167
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>She would have to separate the child from her parents.</v>

168
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.950
<v Speaker 1>The kellers agreed to let Anne and Helen lived in a small cottage not far from</v>

169
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>the main house and wanted Helen to things that they had traveled a long distance</v>

170
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>from the family,</v>

171
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 1>so the two of them set out on a carriage ride.</v>

172
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>This unknown to Helen circled back to the cottage.</v>

173
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Helen wasn't happy to be packed off with a strict new teacher.</v>

174
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>She spent the first day screaming and throwing things around the cottage that</v>

175
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 1>night and have a hotel and down for hours just to keep her in best.</v>

176
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>The child's strength and determination.</v>

177
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>They were incredible,</v>

178
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but I'm was just that little bit greater as the days and weeks passed and was</v>

179
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>able to slowly bring Helen under control.</v>

180
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>The change began when Anne started spelling out words on Helen's part.</v>

181
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>The first word was doll.</v>

182
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>The finger play in tree teller and she proved to be an excellent minute.</v>

183
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Soon she was spelling out a dozen,</v>

184
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>three letter words with her fingers,</v>

185
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 1>but she still didn't know what they met.</v>

186
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>The breakthrough came on April the fifth,</v>

187
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

188
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>87 that morning and had been trying to get out and do you understand the</v>

189
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>differences between the words,</v>

190
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Mug and water.</v>

191
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.400
<v Speaker 1>She took her to the water pump,</v>

192
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 1>pound,</v>

193
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.383
<v Speaker 1>sign the cottage,</v>

194
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>and had the girl hold out a mug and then work to the pump so the water filled it</v>

195
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and began to overflow.</v>

196
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 1>She then began to spell the word water on Helen's free hands.</v>

197
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the light went off.</v>

198
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.334
<v Speaker 1>In Helen's mind,</v>

199
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>she later wrote that living world awakened my soul.</v>

200
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.593
<v Speaker 1>Give it light,</v>

201
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

202
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 1>joy,</v>

203
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.813
<v Speaker 1>set it free.</v>

204
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Now she had a taste for word meanings.</v>

205
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't get enough.</v>

206
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to and to spell out everything around her.</v>

207
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>She managed add dozens of new words to have vocabulary every single day as their</v>

208
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the world group.</v>

209
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Alan's personality began to mellow and the temper tantrums became less frequent.</v>

210
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>She came to understand that people would treat her with greater empathy if she</v>

211
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>displayed a kind and caring personality with the key to knowledge,</v>

212
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>understanding words meaning now unlocked.</v>

213
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Helen was able to learn with amazing speed in just a few short months.</v>

214
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 1>She was reading books in Braille and was no longer at spelling only simple words</v>

215
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>onto Helen's pile.</v>

216
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Now she was signing portions of Shakespeare and so the Bible,</v>

217
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>by the time she was nine,</v>

218
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Helen was reading the works of such great poets as Shelly longfellow and Oliver</v>

219
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Wendell Holmes.</v>

220
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>This made her far more advanced in a literary sense than most other children of</v>

221
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:49.214
<v Speaker 1>her age,</v>

222
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>and quickly came to the realization that Helen's ability to comprehend complex</v>

223
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>ideas was highly advanced.</v>

224
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Writing a report to the director of the Perkins School for the blind.</v>

225
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 1>She spoke of vans near genius level learning ability,</v>

226
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 1>but she added the director must not show the report to anyone else she didn't</v>

227
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>want to add in to be turned into a prodigy.</v>

228
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.711
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

229
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 1>the director Michael and saw Helen story isn't opportunity for reflected glory.</v>

230
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>He talks all the 56th annual report of the Perkins School,</v>

231
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.823
<v Speaker 1>Helen Keller,</v>

232
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>a second,</v>

233
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Laura Bridgeman in the reports in embellished Helen story,</v>

234
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 1>making it even more irresistible to the press before long newspapers all over</v>

235
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

236
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>We're writing gushing stories about the child genius.</v>

237
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>He was reading Shakespeare despite not being able to see or hear Helen story</v>

238
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:35.950
<v Speaker 1>even reached across the Europe where Queen Victoria was intrigued.</v>

239
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you hear of the brilliant little deaf and blind girl by age 10?</v>

240
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Having color was an internationally renowned figure when a policeman shot her</v>

241
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>

242
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>lioness.</v>

243
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>The news was picked up in the papers.</v>

244
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Indeed people began sending her money to buy another doc.</v>

245
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Helen was reported as saying that she didn't need a new dog,</v>

246
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 1>but she would like to use the money to help a poor blind,</v>

247
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>deaf and mute boy named Tommy Stringer to attends the Perkins School for the</v>

248
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>

249
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 1>The public responded and Tommy's tuition fees were paid for.</v>

250
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.450
<v Speaker 1>This inspired Helen.</v>

251
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>He wants to help more children,</v>

252
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.920
<v Speaker 1>so she began writing letters to people who are willing to donate money</v>

253
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.610
<v Speaker 1>by the time she was 10 years of age.</v>

254
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Helen had not spoken a clear word in her life,</v>

255
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.050
<v Speaker 1>but then in March of 18,</v>

256
00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:17.590
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>

257
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.190
<v Speaker 1>she heard about a deaf blind girl in Norway who had learned to speak with our</v>

258
00:10:21.191 --> 00:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

259
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Now she became obsessed with doing the same thing and Sullivan,</v>

260
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.150
<v Speaker 1>new justice you could help out and that would be Sarah Fuller,</v>

261
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.150
<v Speaker 1>the director of the school for the deaf in Boston,</v>

262
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts Fuller decided to teach helen herself.</v>

263
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.690
<v Speaker 1>She took a hold of Helen's hands and placed it over her mouth to allow the girl</v>

264
00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:40.330
<v Speaker 1>to feel the movement of our lips and tongue as she spoke,</v>

265
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.390
<v Speaker 1>helen then copied the motions without own speech organs.</v>

266
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.330
<v Speaker 1>After only an hour of intense concentration and effort,</v>

267
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.180
<v Speaker 1>she was able to speak her first sentence.</v>

268
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.920
<v Speaker 1>It's too warm.</v>

269
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.330
<v Speaker 1>The sounds of Helen's voice,</v>

270
00:10:52.331 --> 00:10:52.840
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

271
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.580
<v Speaker 1>was almost impossible to understand how untrained vocal chords would need a lot</v>

272
00:10:57.581 --> 00:11:00.490
<v Speaker 1>of practice before she was able to make legible speech.</v>

273
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.480
<v Speaker 1>In later years,</v>

274
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.840
<v Speaker 1>she would train for three summers under the guidance of a famous music teacher</v>

275
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.800
<v Speaker 1>in order to improve her speaking voice back at Alabama.</v>

276
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I learned that and continue to work on speech developments.</v>

277
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 1>They also developed a method of hearing what others were saying.</v>

278
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.660
<v Speaker 1>She would place a thumb on the throat of the speaker,</v>

279
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.900
<v Speaker 1>her forefinger on their lips and her middle finger on their notes.</v>

280
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 1>This would allow her to translate the vibrations into sounds</v>

281
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.793
<v Speaker 1>in November 18,</v>

282
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>

283
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 1>11 year old helens and the birthday presents and Michael and agnostic director</v>

284
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>of the Perkins Institute.</v>

285
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a short story that she had written on her Braille slate or the frost</v>

286
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.340
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>

287
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>and I was impressed with the quality of the pros and published the story and the</v>

288
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Perkins Alumini magazine.</v>

289
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Helen was overjoyed to become a published author,</v>

290
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>but the joy was short lived.</v>

291
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Reports reach Tuscumbia that there was a book in Prince Goals of the frost.</v>

292
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Fairies by Margaret t can be the story was uncannily.</v>

293
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Similar to Helen Story,</v>

294
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 1>the frost gang accusations started to circulate that she had plagiarized the</v>

295
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

296
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>When this was explained to her,</v>

297
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 1>she was horrified.</v>

298
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.293
<v Speaker 1>Reading can be.</v>

299
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 1>She realized the similarities were striking,</v>

300
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 1>but she was adamant that she had written her own original story.</v>

301
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 1>The reality was that Helen had become a voracious reader.</v>

302
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 1>She would digest one book after another with no thought who had written them.</v>

303
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Ideas became jumbled in her mind,</v>

304
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and she wasn't able to remember if they came from yourself or from what she had</v>

305
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

306
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 1>so when she enthusiastically produced a story,</v>

307
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>she believed that the ideas own.</v>

308
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.161
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

309
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 1>a worker at the Parkinson's institute had indeed read the frost ferries to her</v>

310
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>for a year before the story simply became lodged in her subconscious and it was</v>

311
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>clearly the inspiration for the frost king.</v>

312
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 1>The incident caused deep embarrassment for Helen.</v>

313
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>She wrote that down in a diary.</v>

314
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 1>It made us feel so bad that people thought we had been untrue and wicked.</v>

315
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>My heart was full of tears for I love the beautiful truth with my whole heart</v>

316
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.583
<v Speaker 1>and mind.</v>

317
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Michael and Agnes was also humiliated by the incidents he had to print a</v>

318
00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>retraction to explain the mixup off questioning.</v>

319
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

320
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>he believes that no deliberate plagiarism was involved,</v>

321
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but then one of his teachers reported to him that Helen had confessed the</v>

322
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 1>wrongdoings or heart.</v>

323
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>The truth was that this manipulative teacher had twisted Helen's words to make</v>

324
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>us sound guilty.</v>

325
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.420
<v Speaker 1>It was enough,</v>

326
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

327
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 1>an agnostic turn against Helen and his former star pupil and Sullivan.</v>

328
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>He sets up a formal hearing in which Helen was interrogated by an eight member</v>

329
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>panel.</v>

330
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the most terrifying experiences if the 11 year old's life.</v>

331
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>After a day of tough scrutiny,</v>

332
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the panel was split down the middle as to whether deliberate plagiarism was</v>

333
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>involved in the ends and agnostics split stalemates coming down on the side of</v>

334
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Helen.</v>

335
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>The Frost King Experience Haunted Helen for many years to come.</v>

336
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Whenever she wrote a sentence from then onwards,</v>

337
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 1>she would check it repeatedly to make sure that it was our own original work.</v>

338
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 1>In March 18,</v>

339
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 1>93 and intelligent attended the presidential inauguration of grover Cleveland's.</v>

340
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.621
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>

341
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:55.520
<v Speaker 1>they went to Niagara Falls where Helen was astounded.</v>

342
00:13:55.521 --> 00:14:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It's and it's the power of the vibrations caused by the massive pounding waters.</v>

343
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.870
<v Speaker 1>They then went on to Chicago to attend the world's fat.</v>

344
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.420
<v Speaker 1>They were escorted by Alexander Graham Bell,</v>

345
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:07.880
<v Speaker 1>who was featuring his telephone at the great exhibition,</v>

346
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.230
<v Speaker 1>but the famous deaf blind gal who had conquered her handicaps was just as much a</v>

347
00:14:12.231 --> 00:14:14.360
<v Speaker 1>draw card as the renowned in Venza,</v>

348
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.180
<v Speaker 1>the exhibition which featured exhibits from all over the world,</v>

349
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.083
<v Speaker 1>frilled Helen.</v>

350
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.510
<v Speaker 1>She was the only one of the millions of visitors.</v>

351
00:14:20.511 --> 00:14:22.730
<v Speaker 1>He was allowed to run her hands over the exhibits.</v>

352
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.810
<v Speaker 1>This gave a a far greater appreciation of the world around than anything she had</v>

353
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:29.750
<v Speaker 1>read in books whetting our appetite to learn more.</v>

354
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 16,</v>

355
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Helen began studying.</v>

356
00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It became bridge school for young ladies in Cambridge,</v>

357
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:39.034
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>

358
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>She was now in class alongside and competing with girls you could see in hip.</v>

359
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm Sullivan attended every class alongside Helen interpreting the lessons.</v>

360
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Helen made rapid progress completing her first year study with honors in German</v>

361
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and English in our second year.</v>

362
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

363
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 1>she struggled,</v>

364
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.280
<v Speaker 1>especially with mathematics.</v>

365
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 1>The decision was made to withdraw her from the school and provide her with a</v>

366
00:14:58.821 --> 00:14:59.654
<v Speaker 1>private tutor.</v>

367
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>

368
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 1>she was ready to take the entrance exam for Radcliffe College,</v>

369
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 1>the Women's division of Harvard University passing with distinction.</v>

370
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>She became the first person with major disabilities to enter an institute of</v>

371
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.894
<v Speaker 1>higher learning.</v>

372
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Helen found the pace at Radcliffe,</v>

373
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 1>frantic again.</v>

374
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 1>She had animal alongside how to spell out the lessons on her fingers,</v>

375
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but even then she had difficulty keeping pace with fast talking lecturers</v>

376
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Speaker 1>despite the hurried pace.</v>

377
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.793
<v Speaker 1>How long did well,</v>

378
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>especially in English during her second year as a literacy teacher,</v>

379
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 1>encouraged her to write her life story so that the world could get an insight</v>

380
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 1>into the struggles that she had gone through.</v>

381
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Helen worked on the manuscript while studying,</v>

382
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.280
<v Speaker 1>which also placed an intolerable strain on her.</v>

383
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Finally in March of 19.</v>

384
00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:38.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

385
00:15:38.851 --> 00:15:39.021
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

386
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>the story of my life was published.</v>

387
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Sales were slow at first,</v>

388
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 1>but it has gone on to become a beloved classic and it was recognized by the New</v>

389
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 1>York public library as one of the 100 most important books of the 20th century.</v>

390
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

391
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 1>this was the first of 15 books that she would go on to write.</v>

392
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Helen graduated from Radcliffe on June the 28th,</v>

393
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.411
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>

394
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:57.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

395
00:15:57.501 --> 00:15:57.920
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

396
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.000
<v Speaker 1>To become the first person with a serious disability to earn an undergraduate</v>

397
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

398
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 1>She now found herself in demand for speaking engagements where people flocked to</v>

399
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.860
<v Speaker 1>hear her inspirational story in 19 Oh,</v>

400
00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>five and Sullivan,</v>

<v Speaker 1>have autobiography.</v>

403
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.010
<v Speaker 1>The three of them lived under the same roof with Mason and Helen developing a</v>

404
00:16:17.011 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 1>very special bond.</v>

405
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Helen devoted the rest of her life to helping the blinds.</v>

406
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 1>She wrote extensively on the subject,</v>

407
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 1>has worked tirelessly for a uniform system of Braille along with them and</v>

408
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:28.280
<v Speaker 1>sometimes some other case.</v>

409
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 1>She traveled internationally,</v>

410
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>giving lectures and sold out halls everywhere from Canada to Australia.</v>

411
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 1>When he died in 1936,</v>

412
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.550
<v Speaker 1>former housemaid poly Thompson became helen's constant companion during World</v>

413
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.640
<v Speaker 1>War Two.</v>

414
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Helen was a ray of hope for the thousands of servicemen who were blinded or</v>

415
00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 1>deafened in combat.</v>

416
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 1>During 1943 alone,</v>

417
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 1>she visited 70 army and naval hospitals up and down the United States.</v>

418
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.813
<v Speaker 1>In her later years,</v>
