1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The leading generals of World War Two,</v>

2
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:03.920
<v Speaker 1>you carried a huge weight on their shoulders.</v>

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Their decisions could mean the difference between life and death for thousands</v>

4
00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:11.330
<v Speaker 1>of men and their actions helped shape the fate of nations.</v>

5
00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>History has judged some of them as falls.</v>

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Others as butches and a handful of Basil military geniuses view that,</v>

7
00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>at least on the airline side,</v>

8
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>have generated as much controversy in life and death.</v>

9
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>As George S.</v>

10
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Patton,</v>

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the flamboyance American commander never lost a major battle,</v>

12
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.500
<v Speaker 1>but his explosive temper almost cost him his career.</v>

13
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>He survived two world wars,</v>

14
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>often placing himself in considerable danger in lead to die in unlikely</v>

15
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>circumstances within months of Germany's defeat.</v>

16
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>The unconventional general was a devout Christian,</v>

17
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>and yet he believed he was just the latest incarnation of a warrior spirit who'd</v>

18
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>once fought alongside the likes of Julius Caesar,</v>

19
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon Bonaparte,</v>

20
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>and others.</v>

21
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>He was the epitome of the rough,</v>

22
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>tough warrior who reveled in his macho image and seemingly lived only for war,</v>

23
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but he could be a surprisingly sensitive individual who cried at funerals and</v>

24
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:03.381
<v Speaker 1>even pens,</v>

25
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>poetry doing this for most of his life.</v>

26
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>In this biographics video.</v>

27
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dive right into the details of this man's life.</v>

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

29
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Georgia is passive.</v>

30
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>he was born in California on the 11th 1885 20 years earlier.</v>

32
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>The paths and family had lost a bunch of their wealth when they found themselves</v>

33
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>on the losing side of American civil war.</v>

34
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.631
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

35
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>by the time of George's birth,</v>

36
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>capacitors were prosperous and they were influential.</v>

37
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:47.334
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

38
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the young George Welch,</v>

39
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>he knew from an early age that he wanted to be a soldier is main obstacles to</v>

40
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>doing this where his weaknesses in maths and English,</v>

41
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't a result of any lack of ability,</v>

42
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>but rather his father's mistrust of form and education,</v>

43
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>which meant that George had to descended school until he reached 12 years of</v>

44
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

45
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>He caught up quickly but only narrowly passed the entrance exam for West Point.</v>

46
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>America's most prestigious military academy while pattern would regularly</v>

47
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>clashed with his superiors during World War Two is conduct at West Point's was</v>

48
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>exemplary.</v>

49
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>He was particularly successful that sports such as Polo and football,</v>

50
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>playing with some relentless aggression that he broke several bones.</v>

51
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>He would lead to bring this aggression to his method of waging war</v>

52
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>

53
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>considerable sporting ability.</v>

54
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It did not go on notice to do a selected to represent the United States of</v>

55
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>America in the modern pentathlon at the 1912 Stockholm and then big games he</v>

56
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>would could be,</v>

57
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.811
<v Speaker 1>is it writing,</v>

58
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:52.201
<v Speaker 1>shooting,</v>

59
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:52.651
<v Speaker 1>fencing,</v>

60
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:52.981
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

61
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and sweating.</v>

62
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>All things that pattern excels at.</v>

63
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.731
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

64
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>in the event it was patterns shooting that may let him down.</v>

65
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>He fired 20 bullets,</v>

66
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but the judges ruled that three of them had missed the target pattern,</v>

67
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>remained adamant that his aim but actually been too good and his shots and pass</v>

68
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.420
<v Speaker 1>through the whole he'd already made and the Bullseye.</v>

69
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It is possible that he was corrected,</v>

70
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>but the judge is ultimately ruled against him.</v>

71
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the first day pattern was placed in a slightly disappointing 21st</v>

72
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>from a 41 competitors.</v>

73
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Strong performances in each of the remaining events that saw him climb all the</v>

74
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>way to fifth place.</v>

75
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It was the first and last time he competed in the Olympic Games,</v>

76
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have to wait long to test the accuracy of his shooting in a combat</v>

77
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:34.361
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

78
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.194
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>By 1916 most of the world's great powers were locked together in seemingly</v>

80
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>interminable conduct.</v>

81
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Only the United States thus far succeeded in avoiding being drawn into the</v>

82
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.770
<v Speaker 1>slaughter.</v>

83
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

84
00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Lyrica did suffer a surprise attack from the direction of Mexico on Boston.</v>

85
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.570
<v Speaker 1>1916 400 heavily armed bandits led by notorious Francisco pantry video stormed</v>

86
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>across the border for two hours.</v>

87
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>They ran Saxons lucid the border town of Columbus before finally being chased</v>

88
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>away by the cavalry.</v>

89
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>If Divia believed he could hide out safely in Mexico,</v>

90
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>he was sorely mistaken.</v>

92
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the u s army crossed the border and put an</v>

93
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>end to the threat.</v>

94
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>John Pershing was given commands of the Expeditionary Force and he chose pattern</v>

95
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>to serve as his eight Pason would go on to become famous for his skill.</v>

96
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>That commanding fast moving motorized forces,</v>

97
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>so it's perhaps fitting that one in Mexico.</v>

98
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>He took part in the first motorized action in the history of warfare traveling</v>

99
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>in three dodge touring cars pattern and his men launched a raid on videos</v>

100
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 1>henchman.</v>

101
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 1>When the smoke cleared at the end of a brief firefight,</v>

102
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>three of his bodyguards lay debt pass an audit their bodies to be strapped to</v>

103
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the cars for the drive back to headquarters.</v>

104
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.501
<v Speaker 1>Pershing,</v>

105
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:56.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>he was apparently impressed reportedly saying this pattern boy,</v>

107
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a real fighter.</v>

108
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>On the 6th of April,</v>

109
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>1917 the United States of America declared war on Germany and entered World War</v>

110
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:18.740
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

111
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Pershing was giving commands if the American expeditionary force and once again</v>

112
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 1>he took George Patton at his side.</v>

113
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Pershing offered him an infantry battalion,</v>

114
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 1>but by that time that passenger had become fascinated by tanks.</v>

115
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.490
<v Speaker 1>They were powerful,</v>

116
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>yet unreliable weapons that were still in their infancy since they'd been</v>

117
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.750
<v Speaker 1>unleashed by the British at the song.</v>

118
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>In September of 1916 he became the first officer assigned to the American</v>

119
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Expeditionary Force tank.</v>

120
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Core ams was at one of the first Americans to learn how to operate a tank and</v>

121
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.930
<v Speaker 1>it's personally towards the first cruise to be assigned to the tank corps.</v>

122
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.950
<v Speaker 1>The American Expeditionary Force tank core finally went into action in September</v>

123
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:59.650
<v Speaker 1>of 1918 with pattern riding battle or clinging to the outside of one of them</v>

124
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>

125
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

126
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.521
<v Speaker 1>That same month though,</v>

127
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>he would be badly injured in an act of near suicide or bravery,</v>

128
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>world war one tanks that they were seriously underpowered.</v>

129
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>They were unreliable and they were totally vulnerable without infantry support.</v>

130
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.151
<v Speaker 1>So when his tanks,</v>

131
00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it became isolated.</v>

132
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>During the Meuse Argonne offensive.</v>

133
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Patton calls for volunteers to help him storm the German lines.</v>

134
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Only five men have stepped forward.</v>

135
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>They were quickly cut it down by a hail of German bullets patterned himself.</v>

136
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>He was badly injured by a piece of shrapnel,</v>

137
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>which hits him in the fight.</v>

138
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>He continued to direct to the battle for Michelle.</v>

139
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Hobo anti later refused medical treatment until he had completed and submitted</v>

140
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.770
<v Speaker 1>his report.</v>

141
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Patton's injuries,</v>

142
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>while they weren't life threatening,</v>

143
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>they were serious.</v>

144
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 1>So by the time he had recovered sufficiently to resend it to combat,</v>

145
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>the armistice had been signed and the guns said form and sign it</v>

<v Speaker 1>fall class and his time at the front lines haven't been brief.</v>

148
00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>He had done more than enough to demonstrate that he possessed the kinds of raw</v>

149
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:02.200
<v Speaker 1>courage he expected and demanded of those who served under him.</v>

150
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>With a great war or is it ends passing [inaudible] of the United States of</v>

152
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>America where he founds a good deal to keep him busy.</v>

153
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Speaker 1>He learns to fly drones.</v>

154
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:22.590
<v Speaker 1>The latest automobile sales is a yacht mixed with high society.</v>

155
00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 1>He kept a stable of horses and one hundreds of trophies and ribbons in numerous</v>

156
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 1>sporting events,</v>

157
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.780
<v Speaker 1>such an extravagant lifestyle would ordinarily be well out of reach for him.</v>

158
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.291
<v Speaker 1>Majors,</v>

159

<v Speaker 1>salary.</v>

160
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.501
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

161
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>in 1910 patented married Beatrice [inaudible] of the extremely wealthy rs of a</v>

<v Speaker 1>Boston industrialist,</v>

163
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.981
<v Speaker 1>the battens.</v>

164
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:40.161
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

165
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 1>they had enough money to do pretty much whatever they wanted,</v>

166
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>but George never wavered from his belief that he was destined to be a great</v>

167
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>soldier.</v>

168
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>He maintained a special interest in armored warfare and some visionaries.</v>

169
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>We're proclaiming the tanks would become the decisive weapon in any future</v>

170
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.600
<v Speaker 1>conflicts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hines Gadarian in Germany and Charles de Gaulle in France,</v>

172
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll give the tanks,</v>

173
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>would return mobility to the battlefields punching through enemy positions to</v>

174
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>create havoc in the rear passenger.</v>

175
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>He was thinking along similar lines and he got the chance to test out some of</v>

176
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:10.371
<v Speaker 1>his ideas.</v>

177
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:15.371
<v Speaker 1>In 1941 when the U s army held fast war games across the states of Louisiana and</v>

178
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Carolina,</v>

179
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.820
<v Speaker 1>more than 400,000 soldiers and 1000 Aircrafts took part in mock battles,</v>

180
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 1>held over 30,000 square miles with Germany.</v>

181
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Once again at war with Britain and Russia.</v>

182
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Ben's no guarantees that America would be able to remain neutral.</v>

183
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a much needed opportunities.</v>

184
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>You get to test out tactics and equipments.</v>

185
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It also served as a test of the men who would lead America's armies into battle.</v>

186
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>The battles they weren't real,</v>

187
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 1>but they were a police,</v>

188
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 1>enough approximation for 61 men to lose their lives.</v>

189
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

190
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>despite these losses,</v>

191
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:51.780
<v Speaker 1>the U s army gained valuable experience and pattern staked his claim.</v>

192
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you arguably be the US army's finest exponents of Ahmed [inaudible].</v>

193
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

194
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.813
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

195
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>On the 7th of December,</v>

196
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.300
<v Speaker 1>1941 Japan attacked to the United States of America.</v>

197
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That's pal harbor.</v>

198
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Four days later,</v>

199
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Germany declared war on America.</v>

200
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.520
<v Speaker 1>As with that World War Two became they truly global war with plans for a 1942</v>

201
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:20.161
<v Speaker 1>allies,</v>

202
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>invasion of western Europe having been shelved.</v>

203
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>The high command instead chose to strike it.</v>

204
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's vishing French allies in North Africa.</v>

205
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Three separate task forces were launched with General George Patton at taking</v>

206
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:36.801
<v Speaker 1>command of 35,000 men of the Western task force ceiling at the Casablanca from</v>

207
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

208
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>It pass on that has any fears or doubts?</v>

209
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

210
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>he certainly wasn't a showing them as he wrote in his diary.</v>

211
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>When I realize what I am,</v>

212
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I am amazed,</v>

213
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 1>but on reflection,</v>

214
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>who is as good as I am,</v>

215
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I know of no one I've ever had.</v>

216
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:50.881
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

217
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>He was fairly modest to the amphibious landings of the 8th of November when</v>

218
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>largely unopposed and despite some fierce resistance as patterns men pushed</v>

219
00:09:59.101 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>inlands.</v>

220
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>The Vichy French signed an armistice later that day,</v>

221
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 1>far more formidable than the French.</v>

222
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:04.291
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

223
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>with Germany is a win.</v>

224
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Rommel and his Africa court on the 14th of February,</v>

225
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>1943 they attacked in force striking a u s troops in years Atlas Mountains.</v>

226
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>By the 20th of February,</v>

227
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>the immediate crisis it was over,</v>

228
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but the Americans,</v>

229
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>they'd been pushed back 50 miles.</v>

230
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Huge amounts of equipment had been abandoned and 4,000 Americans including</v>

231
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:26.101
<v Speaker 1>pattern zones.</v>

232
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Son in law had been captured by the Germans with morale on the floor and those</v>

233
00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>and how a sac to the commander,</v>

234
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>he held responsible and placed all American troops in Tunisia under patterns,</v>

235
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>commands person immediately subjected as men to an intensive drill routine and</v>

236
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>strict disciplinary coat.</v>

237
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>His methods weren't far from university popular,</v>

238
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.650
<v Speaker 1>but they got results and within a month pattern was on the offensive defeating</v>

239
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the formidable German 10th Panzer Division at the Battle of El Guitar passing</v>

240
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>rapidly build himself a reputation in north Africa,</v>

241
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>but it was here at the t began his rivalry with Bernard Montgomery,</v>

242
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.300
<v Speaker 1>the commander of the British Eighth Army while passing.</v>

243
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:02.911
<v Speaker 1>It was bold,</v>

244
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:03.451
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>

245
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:05.070
<v Speaker 1>and often acted on gut instinct.</v>

246
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Montgomery.</v>

247
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>It was by nature,</v>

248
00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>read far more cautious man.</v>

249
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You put great stock in meticulous planning,</v>

250
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>patterned believed Eisenhower deferred to Montgomery,</v>

251
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>far too often a feeling that was only strengthens when the British commander was</v>

252
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 1>given the go ahead to plan the invasion of Sicily.</v>

253
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

254
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.140
<v Speaker 1>The invasion of Sicily was to be a joint operation conducted the British Eighth</v>

255
00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:40.141
<v Speaker 1>Army led by Montgomery as the u s seventh on the commanded blink George Pattern,</v>

256
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.460
<v Speaker 1>much to persons discussed the Montgomery's plan place.</v>

257
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.830
<v Speaker 1>The main emphasis on the British contingent and cast the Americans in the</v>

258
00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:48.970
<v Speaker 1>supporting role.</v>

259
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>This is what you get fumed pattern when your commander in chief Eisenhower</v>

260
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 1>ceases to be an American hands becomes an ally.</v>

261
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.061
<v Speaker 1>The invasion force,</v>

262
00:11:57.061 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it landed on the beaches of Sicily on the 10th of July,</v>

263
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>1943 by nice for the allies had put 80,000 men and 300 tanks or short.</v>

264
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>The next day it patterned himself came to inspect the beachhead,</v>

265
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>wading in the through the surf,</v>

266
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>even as artillery shells exploded around the beach.</v>

267
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 1>While it seemed became clear that the Germans would not be able to hold Sicily.</v>

268
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>They fought a fierce rear guard action as they began to evacuated their army to</v>

269
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>the Italian mainland's.</v>

270
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>As Montgomery's army became bogged down at pattern,</v>

271
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 1>decided to take a loose interpretation of his orders.</v>

272
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 1>He was expected to support the British,</v>

273
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but I mean surely the best way to do this would be to hit the Germans heart</v>

274
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.101
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

275
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Dhruv the seventh army on his goal now was to beat him Montgomery to the city of</v>

276
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the north of the islands.</v>

277
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>He was driven not just by his personal ambition,</v>

278
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>but by a desire to prove that the American soldier was the best in the world.</v>

279
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 1>The Sicily campaign was fought at a blistering pace in blazing heat casualties.</v>

280
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

281
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 1>they were inevitable on August,</v>

282
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>1943 paths and visited the wounded at a field hospital.</v>

283
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>When he discovered that one of the patients was physically unhurt but suffering</v>

284
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>from shell shock,</v>

285
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.480
<v Speaker 1>he exploded with rage pattern.</v>

286
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 1>It slaps to the unfortunate man dragged in from the tent and kicked him in the</v>

287
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 1>backside and then threatened to shoot him for cowardice.</v>

288
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

289
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 1>for pattern,</v>

290
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>this extraordinary display had been conducted under the noses of a number of</v>

291
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 1>journalists patterned and it seemed to realize had done anything wrong,</v>

292
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.371
<v Speaker 1>but striking.</v>

293
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>A subordinate was a court martial offense.</v>

294
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower ordered pattern to apologize bags of the witnesses not to report on</v>

295
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>the incidents and hoped that that would be enough to protect his most dangerous</v>

296
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 1>weapon in the war against the Nazis spa pattern one is rest in Messina and</v>

297
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:34.720
<v Speaker 1>through the Nazis out of Sicily is vicious.</v>

298
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Temper came back to bite him as word.</v>

299
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>If his assaults leaked out in the press,</v>

300
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>there was this or more Eisenhower could do pattern.</v>

301
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He was removed from his commands and with that it seemed as if his Korea,</v>

302
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.303
<v Speaker 1>it might be over</v>

303
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the invasion of Italy,</v>

304
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.580
<v Speaker 1>was a natural result of the conquest of Sicily.</v>

305
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Patton,</v>

306
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.950
<v Speaker 1>who was ill suited to inactivity B could only watch on in frustration of even</v>

307
00:14:04.951 --> 00:14:06.870
<v Speaker 1>greater importance than the campaign and this,</v>

308
00:14:06.871 --> 00:14:10.470
<v Speaker 1>and he was the long awaited invasion of western Europe.</v>

309
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.910
<v Speaker 1>This would take place in June of 1944 it was one of the most difficult</v>

310
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:16.290
<v Speaker 1>operations of the war.</v>

311
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.460
<v Speaker 1>There's pattern would have it,</v>

312
00:14:17.461 --> 00:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>no direct role to play in the invasion.</v>

313
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Instead though there was used as a decoy given commands of an entirely</v>

314
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:27.210
<v Speaker 1>fictitious army intended to fool the Germans into believing that a second</v>

315
00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:29.730
<v Speaker 1>invasion force was preparing to strike the ruse.</v>

316
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.900
<v Speaker 1>It totally worked.</v>

317
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 1>The Germans never imagines that the allies would leave their best offensive</v>

318
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.340
<v Speaker 1>general back in Britain.</v>

319
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.370
<v Speaker 1>While such a vote of the offensive was being fought in France.</v>

320
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

321
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

322
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Greatest fear was that the war would be before he could get back into it.</v>

323
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>He needs tons of worried though.</v>

324
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 1>While the success of the initial allied invasion exceeded expectations,</v>

325
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>the British and the Americans made slow progress as they attempted to push</v>

326
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.660
<v Speaker 1>inland's.</v>

327
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the end of July for the Americans finally punched the small hole</v>

328
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:08.030
<v Speaker 1>through the German lines.</v>

329
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Omar Bradley,</v>

330
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>commander of the U s grounds forces knew that this was the moment to get pattern</v>

331
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>back into the frame.</v>

332
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Radley it regarded pattern as difficult to control and predictable and vulgar,</v>

333
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but he recognized his talents pattern was given commands of the newly formed</v>

334
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Third Army,</v>

335
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 1>a Heidi mobile force equipped with plenty of art that he was ordered to go back</v>

336
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>and it's break through the German lines pattern that quickly got to work,</v>

337
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 1>squeezed his armored divisions through the narrowest of gaps in the German</v>

338
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:35.121
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>

339
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>reform them on the other side and within a matter of days is Third Army was</v>

340
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:42.440
<v Speaker 1>tearing through open country and to Brittany.</v>

341
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 1>The speed of patterns.</v>

342
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Advances often worry to superior.</v>

343
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Since he was a risk taker,</v>

344
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.550
<v Speaker 1>he rarely worried about the danger of an attack to his flanks.</v>

345
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Hitler himself actually thought it sniffed out and opportunity to exploit the</v>

346
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 1>allied breakout.</v>

347
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.550
<v Speaker 1>He would launch a counterattack and cutoff patterns Ahmed's spearheads.</v>

348
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Now this idea,</v>

349
00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

350
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>it did have its merits in theory,</v>

351
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 1>but the German army lacked the strength.</v>

352
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you execute the operation in practice?</v>

353
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It was instead the Germans,</v>

354
00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 1>he found themselves in danger of being complete and the encircled at filets pass</v>

355
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 1>and believed he was in a position to slam the drawers of the trap shot.</v>

356
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Bradley a far more cautious,</v>

357
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.150
<v Speaker 1>commanded them Patton or did the Third Army to halt our Jensen passing.</v>

358
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.031
<v Speaker 1>He was furious,</v>

359
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>but he complied with the order even though he suspected Bradley had been</v>

360
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Montgomery.</v>

361
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:25.694
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

362
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.251
<v Speaker 1>headless fails.</v>

363
00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Counselor attack LEDs to the near collapse of the German army in France without</v>

364
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.081
<v Speaker 1>a pattern.</v>

365
00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:43.360
<v Speaker 1>It was freeze and launches blitzkrieg assaults.</v>

366
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.190
<v Speaker 1>His philosophy was relentless attack and unrelenting pressure that caps the</v>

367
00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:52.690
<v Speaker 1>enemy constantly off balance and to minimize the Third Army casualties pattern</v>

368
00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:54.250
<v Speaker 1>argued that if he was properly back,</v>

369
00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:57.450
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to cross the river Rhine and a matter of weeks spots pass and</v>

370
00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:00.190
<v Speaker 1>found himself at once again in competition with Montgomery,</v>

371
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.450
<v Speaker 1>as each man is empty,</v>

372
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 1>do you secure enough supplies to keep their army moving as passing complains,</v>

373
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.170
<v Speaker 1>my man can eat their belts,</v>

374
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:07.451
<v Speaker 1>spares.</v>

375
00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:09.280
<v Speaker 1>My tanks have got to have gas.</v>

376
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Although there were such disagreements amongst the leading ally generals,</v>

377
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.930
<v Speaker 1>they were United in the belief that Hitler's armies were all but beaten.</v>

378
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Germany's Phurah.</v>

379
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:18.700
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

380
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.930
<v Speaker 1>had one last surprise in store on the 16th of December,</v>

381
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.220
<v Speaker 1>1944 the Germans launched a vast counter attack aimed at a thinly held section</v>

382
00:17:27.221 --> 00:17:28.900
<v Speaker 1>of the American lines at our den.</v>

383
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.160
<v Speaker 1>This was the beginning of the battle that we had become famous as the battle of</v>

384
00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the bulge,</v>

385
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.140
<v Speaker 1>the at southern and furious.</v>

386
00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:36.400
<v Speaker 1>The soul's badly rattles,</v>

387
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.540
<v Speaker 1>most allied commodities that's and recognized once that Hitler had made a</v>

388
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:42.040
<v Speaker 1>serious strategic error.</v>

389
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Let the sons of bitches go all the way to Paris.</v>

390
00:17:44.711 --> 00:17:45.940
<v Speaker 1>If they like your job's,</v>

391
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.550
<v Speaker 1>then we can really cut them off and shoot them up.</v>

392
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower to senior commanders do an emergency conference where he asked how</v>

393
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:53.600
<v Speaker 1>long it would take a pattern.</v>

394
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you divert his third army to the Adana pattern?</v>

395
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Told him he could have three divisions there within 48 hours.</v>

396
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.620
<v Speaker 1>This seemingly fantastical claim was matched with a mixture of laughter.</v>

397
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Then disbelieving stairs,</v>

398
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but pattern.</v>

399
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.991
<v Speaker 1>He was in tiny,</v>

400
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 1>serious hit anticipated Eisenhower's request and just staff were already making</v>

401
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:12.001
<v Speaker 1>preparations.</v>

402
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you disengage the part of the third army in order to wheel it around,</v>

403
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.690
<v Speaker 1>they would then race to the rescue along narrow icy roads.</v>

404
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.950
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of the bulge gave of the allied high commands,</v>

405
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>a shock lets as pattern had predicted is accomplished nothing and cost.</v>

406
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Hitler has lost reserves now.</v>

407
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>The River Rhine was the last significant obstacles that the western allies have</v>

408
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>to tackle.</v>

409
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.160
<v Speaker 1>The main crossing was to be launched Irvine,</v>

410
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.781
<v Speaker 1>Montgomery.</v>

411
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Mattie spent two months planning every last detail of the operation,</v>

412
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 1>which calls for an airborne assault,</v>

413
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 1>a huge artillery bombardments and even the assistance of specialized the US navy</v>

414
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 1>vessels.</v>

415
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Well Gum Murray's crossing was launched on the 23rd of March by which time</v>

416
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.550
<v Speaker 1>pattern had already stolen his thumbs up,</v>

417
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.400
<v Speaker 1>like quietly sneaking a division across under the cover of darkness and</v>

418
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 1>establishing a bridgehead on the other side.</v>

419
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 1>He phones Bradley to let him know what he'd done but don't tell anyone.</v>

420
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 1>He said because the crowds haven't realized yet</v>

421
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 1>with its feeds of Germany and tried and failed to secure a posting to the Far</v>

422
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 1>East in order to play a part in the war against Japan.</v>

423
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

424
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.790
<v Speaker 1>he was appointed as governor of the Varian,</v>

425
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.860
<v Speaker 1>the political posts.</v>

426
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Twitchy was not well suited.</v>

427
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 1>He fell out with the Russians,</v>

428
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 1>refused to remove Nazi personnel from key administrative positions on the basis</v>

429
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 1>that there was nobody else qualified to do the job,</v>

430
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 1>and it's got to tricks by a reporter into agreeing that Nazis joins the party</v>

431
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and more or less the same way as Americans became Democrats or Republicans</v>

432
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:40.861
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>

433
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>political abilities didn't really compare to his military abilities.</v>

434
00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Angie,</v>

435
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.130
<v Speaker 1>once again succeeded in outraging the press.</v>

436
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 1>His subsequent apology was deemed insufficient.</v>

437
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:49.631
<v Speaker 1>Tends.</v>

438
00:19:49.631 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 1>He was removed from his post for the second time,</v>

439
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 1>but at this point,</v>

440
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 1>although he didn't know it,</v>

441
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.190
<v Speaker 1>he had only a few months left to live on December the ninth 1945 pattern was</v>

442
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 1>being driven towards a hunting expedition when the vehicle he was traveling in</v>

443
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 1>was struck by a truck traveling in the opposite direction.</v>

444
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else was hurt.</v>

445
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.850
<v Speaker 1>That's passing,</v>

446
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>was paralyzed from the neck down the injured general.</v>

447
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 1>He was rushed to hospital where he died 11 days later,</v>

448
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.700
<v Speaker 1>he was buried in Europe alongside the fallen soldiers who was beloved Third Army</v>

449
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Patton.</v>

450
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>It always wanted to die in battle,</v>

451
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but instead he lost his life as the result of a low speed collision in</v>

452
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:24.204
<v Speaker 1>peacetime.</v>

453
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.251
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

454
00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:33.940
<v Speaker 1>most everybody accepts the official version of patterns demise and it has been</v>

455
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:37.780
<v Speaker 1>suggested the person may have been assassinated by the Russians,</v>

456
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.270
<v Speaker 1>possibly even in collusion with the u s government.</v>

457
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.960
<v Speaker 1>This would have been as a result of his outspoken opposition to the Soviet Union</v>

458
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.800
<v Speaker 1>when he died,</v>

459
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.910
<v Speaker 1>he was 60 years old,</v>
