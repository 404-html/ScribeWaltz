1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.051
In modern times.

2
00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:04.910
We look back at the Nazis third or I can wonder how on earth anyone could've

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.120
followed out of hello and it was so clearly an evil dictator.
Well,

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.290
this was all thanks to yourself.
Girdles the minister of propaganda.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
He knew exactly how to manipulate the minds of a nation with fake news,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.880
Nazi idealized the books and propaganda films.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.030
Goebbels was single handedly responsible for brainwashing entire populations and

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.780
destroying people who were caught in his web of lies.
Today on biographics,

9
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.760
you're going to learn how one man convinced millions of normal German people to

10
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.310
all become faithful Nazis.

11
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.403
<v 1>Okay,</v>

12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.210
cool.
Oh,

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.950
<v 0>yes.
Of gerbils was born on October the 29th 1897 in a small town outside of</v>

14
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.784
Dusseldorf.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.900
His father Fritz worked in a factory and his mother stayed at home to take care

16
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:05.040
of him and his four other siblings.
His family never had a lot of money,

17
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.710
but they still paid for him to go to a private.
All boys,

18
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.850
rem and Catholic high school girls was born with a disability where the bone

19
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:15.570
marrow of his feet never developed properly and Z had a club foot.

20
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.230
His parents paid for him to have an operation in order to correct the issue,

21
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.500
but even when both of his feet were pointing in the right direction,

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.790
he's still needed to a metal brace on his leg for the rest of his life.

23
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.721
This operation,

24
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.800
it stunted his growth and one leg was permanently shorter than the other causing

25
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.030
him to have a limp.

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.020
He also had chronically inflamed lungs and got sick very often.

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.280
He grew up to be very angry at the wells and he felt that life was unfair.

28
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.480
He decided to focus a lot of his time and energy into reading books and getting

29
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:47.310
good grades.
This disability,

30
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.910
it prevented him from doing military service during World War One he was able to

31
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.210
on an academic scholarship and attended the University of Heidelberg.

32
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.390
He stayed in school for years and earned a phd in philosophy in 1921 at this

33
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.180
point,
he completely rejected the teachings of the Catholic Church.

34
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.140
He wrote about his personal ideas of how he thought the world should be and saw

35
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:11.700
himself as a great philosopher and to think of unfortunately.
Then though,
well,

36
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.020
no one else agreed.

37
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.220
He was very loud and outspoken and was always trying to get noticed.

38
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.121
Even then,

39
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.290
he was very antisemitic and many of his opinions whips so hateful that the

40
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.020
articles and books were rejected for publication.

41
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.320
He decided to create his own publication for his opinions,

42
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:31.980
but very few people actually cared to read it by all accounts.

43
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.970
He was a failed writer,
runs an incredibly damaged,
there's all man.

44
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.900
He made a bit of money being a tutor and finally sold a few articles,

45
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.900
but other than that,
he had this alter,
no money to speak of.

46
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.370
All of this motivated them to join the Nazi party in 1924 at this time,

47
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.300
Germany was going through a tremendous financial depression and the Nazis

48
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:55.440
promised that they would fix the country with the Nazis Goebbels.

49
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.920
He finally found a home and a group of people who were actually willing read as

50
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.760
hateful work.

51
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.840
They thought that he was absolutely great at creating pro Nazi propaganda.

52
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.920
Indeed,
it was good enough to convince new members to join the party.

53
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700
His work indeed helps get out off Hitler elected when he rose to power.

54
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.690
Hitler appointed gobbles as the minister of propaganda since he was unemployed

55
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:20.290
at the time.
This is very literally changed everything overnight.

56
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.240
Suddenly his life had meaning and see,
truly looked up to adult Hitler as well,

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.970
his best friends and indeed his savior.

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.900
[inaudible] gave Goebbels the task of censoring any media that may conflict with

59
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.010
Nazi ideals.

60
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.240
He began to give the order of burning books that were written by certain
authors.

61
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.960
Some of the books that gobbles destroyed middle of a sentence like the socialist

62
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.910
philosophy of Karl Marx.
However,

63
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:47.260
some of the choices of band authors seem to be a bit random and there's no real

64
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.040
logical explanation as to why gobbles would want to raise them from history.

65
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.850
This has led some people to speculate that he wanted to destroy certain authors

66
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:58.750
just out of petty jealousy,
that they were better writers than he was.

67
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.870
This gave him a taste of authority and a taste of control and he loved it.

68
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.000
Aside from censoring the media,

69
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.140
Gobble set out to create new cons ends in order to replace it.

70
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.080
Kind of always knew that one of the most powerful ways to incite emotions in

71
00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:22.920
human beings was three movies,
the largest film studio in Berlin.

72
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:27.480
It's called the universe in film,
Axion,
Gazelle shaft or the Ufa for short.

73
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.470
They were well respected throughout the world for producing beautiful silent

74
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.800
films like metropolis.
In 1927 one of Goebbels,

75
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:39.480
his first orders of business was to forcibly take the studio over on behalf of

76
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.020
the Nazi government.
Both girdles and Hitler were huge movie buffs,

77
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:46.230
but they made the decision to send the American films from the public.

78
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.790
Adult fell.

79
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.440
There's still had all of the new releases from Hollywood in his personal

80
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:53.280
collection,
but no one in the general population was ever allowed to see them.

81
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.030
Yes,
of gerbils set out to make sure that everyone working in the German film

82
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.860
industry was loyal to hit blood.

83
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.450
Any of the actors who refuse to shun any Jewish people from their lives and join

84
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:06.480
the Nazi party were blacklisted from ever working again.

85
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.300
Many of them were even prevented from leaving the country,

86
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:13.710
and some actors even chose to commit suicide.
Actresses from throughout Europe,

87
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.330
auditions for the prestigious Ufa studio had no idea that they were walking into

88
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:18.781
a trap.

89
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:22.830
As many of them signs multiyear contracts before the Nazis came into power.

90
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.780
So while there were some actors who would not see,

91
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:29.160
as many of them were forced to participate in these films against their will go

92
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:33.150
all set out to create German versions of some of the big blockbuster hits in

93
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.320
America.
He also created movies where the only goal was to brainwash people into

94
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:40.830
believing Nazi ideals.
It,
some of them were clearly propaganda,

95
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.680
like one gold Hitler,
youth cracks.
There's other films.

96
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:47.970
What cleverly disguised subtly changing the opinions of Germans to suit the

97
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:49.800
needs of the Nazis.
For example,

98
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:54.570
the 1941 movie I accuse was orchestrated to get the general population to agree

99
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:56.340
with the Axion t four program,

100
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:59.930
which pushed for euthanization of disabled and Tom and Leo people.

101
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.990
The plots of I accuse is about a doctor at the peak of his career.

102
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.120
He gets married to a beautiful young woman.

103
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.240
I need to find out that she has been diagnosed with Ms. Mack.

104
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:12.050
Then the treatment for ms was nothing like it is today and there's no cure for

105
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.640
the disease.
This means that the wife was dying a very slow and painful death.

106
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.900
She begged him to give a lethal injection so she could be put out of our misery.

107
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.160
He struggled with the decision,

108
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:26.450
but ultimately assisted in how suicide much of the movie takes place in a court

109
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:30.200
of law where they are trying to decide if this man should be guilty of murder or

110
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:33.980
if he was doing her a favor by killing her.
Despite being a propaganda film.

111
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.140
It's actually very well written.
Even today.

112
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.410
Anyone who watches the film may find themselves questioning their own morals,

113
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:43.040
which is why it was considered to be one of the most dangerous propaganda films

114
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.874
ever made.

115
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.750
The movie convinced people that assisted suicide was only going to help their

116
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.590
friends and family members who were suffering.
So the [inaudible] program,

117
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.980
it was passed and listen,

118
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.140
people were then taken from their homes and killed in the name of a perfect

119
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:59.450
master race.
The same kind of brainwashing.

120
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.480
It happens over and over again in the movies.

121
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.010
<v 1>And honestly,</v>

122
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.740
<v 0>if I was,
he didn't just help gerbils.
Korea,</v>

123
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.610
it's also helped him get into a relationship after graduating from is all boys

124
00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:17.910
school.
He was not used to speaking to girls at 34 years old.

125
00:07:17.911 --> 00:07:20.850
In 1931 he married a fellow Nazi named Magda.

126
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.970
Henslow was the best man at their wedding in the public eye.

127
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:27.000
They appear to have the perfect German marriage.

128
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.840
They had several children together and they lived on a huge gated compound in

129
00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.720
the woods outside of Berlin.
However,

130
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.060
use of Goebbels had a reputation for objectifying women and since he was

131
00:07:36.061 --> 00:07:38.790
surrounded by beautiful actresses,
he can beat you.

132
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.380
Took advantage of his position.

133
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.140
According to the testimony of a woman named Anneliese Uhlig,

134
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.950
she was given the starring role in one of the movies that was made at the Ufa

135
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:47.630
studio.

136
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.910
Girls asked her if she wants it to go for a drive and talk about the movie,

137
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:53.100
and he drove her straight to his compound.

138
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.650
He offered her a drink and began to force himself on her.

139
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.080
She started kicking and screaming and got free from him.

140
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.240
He said that if she did not meet his demands,

141
00:08:00.241 --> 00:08:03.090
he would make sure that she never had a career in the movies.

142
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.390
She decided to take a chance and ran out of the door bust.

143
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:07.980
When she showed up the next day to work,

144
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.420
there was an announcement that the film was cancels and Uhlig was blacklisted

145
00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:14.820
from ever working in Germany again.
Yes,

146
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:17.010
I've gobbles did this to women on a regular basis,

147
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:20.640
but he did actually fall in love with one woman named leader bar over.

148
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.140
She was one of the few actresses who was truly a faithful Nazi and she even

149
00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:28.680
turned down opportunities to work in Hollywood in favor of moving to Germany.

150
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.630
She moved from Prague to Berlin in 1935 and married an actor named Gustaf

151
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.401
Froelich fro liquid,

152
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:38.240
divorced his Jewish wife in order to continue his successful acting career

153
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.630
according to lead a bar ever.

154
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.380
She felt pressured into being in a relationship with Yosef girdles because she

155
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:46.530
had heard of all of the stories about him ruining other actors' careers.

156
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.910
She knew that if she said no,

157
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:51.540
there was a huge jobs that she and her husband would never work again,

158
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.560
but she must have been a good actress because he became convinced that they run

159
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.370
away together,

160
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.820
gather all stoles his wife Magda about the affair and said that he wanted a

161
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:00.420
divorce.

162
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.170
Magda went straight down off atlas saying that nearby river was seducing him and

163
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:06.360
trying to tend them.
Our Jackpot Gobbles,

164
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.490
begged hitless permission to get a divorce.

165
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.120
He also wanted to move to Japan and give up his position of power.

166
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.400
He was willing to give up everything in order to be with Nida,

167
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.960
but it's even as one of the most powerful Nazis in the Third Reich hosts.

168
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.200
If gerbils was still a prisoner to hit less power,

169
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.750
Hitler refused to let go of those,

170
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.090
quit his job because he was far too valuable to the Nazi cause.

171
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.960
The two men got into a screaming match that was witnessed and heard by dozens of

172
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.960
people.
Hitler RegEd him to give his relationship with Magda.

173
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.560
The second chance he insisted that they give themselves another three months of

174
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:39.990
living together to try and repair the relationship.

175
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.750
If they could not fix their marriage within those three months,

176
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.400
then he could get a divorce.

177
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.850
Hedler Radha lead of our over to leave Germany within 24 hours,

178
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:51.840
giving her a one way ticket to Prague after this incident.
Yes.
If Goebbels,

179
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.060
who is no longer one of Hitler's favorite men,

180
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.360
his wife also hated him and his lover was gone.

181
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.070
He was no longer invited over to dinner at his place and they barely even spoke

182
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.270
the other higher up Nazis.

183
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:06.660
They believe the gulls had become weak and that he was getting insane.

184
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.470
They questioned his loyalty and he was no longer seen as the powerful men that

185
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.590
he wants,
wants.
If he wants it to be back in good graces with Hitler,

186
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.900
he would need to do something extreme.

187
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.460
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

188
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.330
I am.

189
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.510
I am.

190
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.250
<v 0>Doubles was desperate to regain hitless trust.</v>

191
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.140
So 1939 he incited a mob by publishing a fake story in the newspaper that said,

192
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:16.530
a German man had been shot by a Jewish man in Paris.

193
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.850
He spoken the streets claiming that the Jews were trying to destroy society.

194
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.640
He lands an angry mob to burn down a synagogue.

195
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.150
That same year he travelled to Poland's with a documentary film crews or show

196
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:29.310
what life was like inside of a Jewish ghetto.

197
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.870
The people living in the ghetto and sunken faces wore rags and generally dirty

198
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:34.470
and sick.

199
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.130
We now know that this is because the Nazis forced them into inhumane conditions

200
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.540
in the first place.
However,

201
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.360
gerbils took this as an opportunity to compare them to animals,

202
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:45.030
saying that they were choosing to live that way.

203
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.440
He said that they were less human and so that they need it to be exterminated.

204
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.740
This film was called the eternal Jew and it premiered in 1940 in this movie.

205
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:58.350
He tried to say that Jews what all criminals and that if the Nazis,

206
00:11:58.351 --> 00:12:01.120
I haven't lost the war,
then they may take over the world,

207
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:03.250
forcing the German people to live in squalor.

208
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.380
Humanity would sink into a tunnel darkness.

209
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:10.180
It would fall into a dal and primitive state where the Jews to win this war.

210
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.470
They are the incarnation of that destructive force that in these terrible years

211
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:19.450
has guided the enemy war leadership into a fight against all that we see as

212
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:24.280
noble,
beautiful and worth keeping.
For that reason alone,
the Jews hate us.

213
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.320
They despise our culture and learning,

214
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:29.770
which they perceive as towering over there nomadic worldview.

215
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.630
They fear our economic and social standards,
which leave no room for that.

216
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:37.460
Parasitic drives.
This documentary.

217
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:41.260
It genuinely frightened the German people and they felt the concentration camps

218
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.620
were absolutely justified after visiting Auschwitz in person,

219
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.370
Yosef girdles wrote that the death and torture of these prisoners were so

220
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.990
gruesome that he did not even want to write the details and his private journal

221
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.400
he wrote,
it may be barbaric,
but they truly deserve it.

222
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.640
All of his efforts to insight hate against the Jewish people.

223
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.240
They paid off and dad off hit the,
began to trust Joseph Goebbels.
Once again.

224
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.210
Then mutual hates was enough to repair their friendship,

225
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.890
but it was that the cost of millions of lives at this point had blood began to

226
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:15.850
trust Joseph Gurbles with more decisions and the government's since he had even

227
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.290
more power than he did before.

228
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.040
Headless stops making so many public appearances and allowed gobbles to speak on

229
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:24.700
his behalf.
Instead,
he even gave him the authority to declare war.

230
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.370
In 1941 gavels announced over the radio,

231
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:30.100
the Germany would be going to war with the Soviet Union.

232
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.240
Goggles did exactly what he did when he filmed the tunnel in Poland.
He brought,

233
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:35.290
he has another documentary.

234
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:38.560
Film crews are show Soviet prisoners who were living in the mud,

235
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.250
but king Hoff debt.
He claims that this is how Russian people normally lived,

236
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.230
is that the bullshit?

237
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.440
I think policy was controlled by Jews who were trying to take over the world.

238
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.890
He successfully convinced the German public,
but by fighting Russia,

239
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.200
they were fighting for their freedom.

240
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.800
He stood in front of a crowd of thousands of people at a sports stadium in

241
00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:00.670
Berlin saying that there needed to be a total war.

242
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.930
This was met with thunderous applause,
but as you may already know,

243
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:08.530
Germany's invasion of Russia is what led to that downfall.

244
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.610
The Germans could not handle the harsh winters in the United States and joins

245
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:13.570
the allied forces.

246
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.890
Italy switched over to the allies as well as that stronghold in world war two it

247
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:20.200
was suddenly falling like dominoes.

248
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.960
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

249
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.680
<v 0>Now you can probably tell so far in this story that Joseph Goebbels was always a</v>

250
00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:31.610
bit crazy,

251
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:35.420
but also the invasion of the Soviet Union has mental states became more and more

252
00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:36.254
unraveled.

253
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.820
He encouraged elderly men and young boys to sacrifice their lives for the sake

254
00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:45.020
of Germany and Babyface,
child soldiers where even sent off to war.

255
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.820
He said that every man,
woman,

256
00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:49.790
and child needed to be ready to die for the motherlands.

257
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.050
According to Bill Fred hove and a man who works on Yossef,
Gerbils,
his staff,

258
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.860
they were.
That's amazing.
When a bomb was dropped in the garden of his house,

259
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.520
the glass of all the windows shattered while everyone else on the staff doctor

260
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.640
for cover.
Yes.
If gobbles never even flinched.

261
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.360
He just brushed the broken glass off his notes and continued reading his speech

262
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:09.590
as if nothing had happened.

263
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.860
He somehow remained completely composed on the outside.

264
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:17.300
While the panic inside was tearing it apart at the end of the war,

265
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:20.630
hadn't had told gobbles that he knew that they were going to lose the war.

266
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.140
He was preparing to go to his bunker with plans to commit suicide.

267
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.710
He appointed gobbles as the new chancellor of Germany and he wanted him to stay

268
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:30.530
behind and run the government.
Once the allies invaded,

269
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.670
gobbles were so devoted that he simply refused to live without Hitler.

270
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.970
He told his wife and all of his children do clean themselves,

271
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:42.320
put on their Sunday best and goes to the fear as bunker on April the 30th that

272
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:45.560
committed suicide leaving gobbles as Germany's new chancellor.

273
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.590
It's not a position he would hold for long though the following day,

274
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:53.060
Goebbels and Magda poisons their six children before ending their own lives as

275
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:55.580
well.
So I'm not going to ask if you enjoyed that video,
