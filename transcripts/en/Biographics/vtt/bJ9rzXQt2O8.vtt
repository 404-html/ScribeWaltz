00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.800
<v Speaker 1>So Hirohito,</v>

11
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>serving as emperor for 63 years,</v>

12
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>vested with Supreme Power and viewed as a deity bias.</v>

13
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.711
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

14

18
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>not in fact a god,</v>

19
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>but just a fallible man dress like the people in this week,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we go beyond the pump,</v>

22
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>the ceremony to discover the man who was emperor Hirohito.</v>

23
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>By the middle of the 19th century,</v>

24
00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>the emperor of Japan had become a title in name only.</v>

25
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>The emperor was merely a figurehead with no real say in matters of states been</v>

26
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.470
<v Speaker 1>changed with the ascension to the throne.</v>

27
00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>If he 120 seconds,</v>

28
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Emperor Meiji,</v>

29
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Meiji embarked upon a series of political reforms that brought about an era of</v>

30
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>enlightened rule by the time of his grandson,</v>

32
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 1>the cult of the emperor.</v>

33
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>It was already well established.</v>

34
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Laws had been inactive for bidding any criticism of the emperor.</v>

35
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>The birth of Emperor Meiji First Grandson on April the 29th,</v>

36
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>1981 was a time of rejoicing throughout the empire.</v>

37
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>The infant was given the title Prince Michi.</v>

38
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>He was named Hirohito,</v>

39
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 1>which comes from a Chinese saying that roughly translates to when society is</v>

40
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>

41
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>The people are content area.</v>

42
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

43
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 1>His father was the 21 year old Crown Prince Akihito.</v>

44
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>It was slightly built and he was constantly unwell.</v>

45
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>His mother was the 16 year olds princess,</v>

46
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>so docker as was the custom among Japanese royals.</v>

47
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>The child was taken from his parents and raised by a surrogate.</v>

48
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>It was decided by the emperor that his grandson be raised by a retired military</v>

49
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>officer in order to provide the mental toughness and discipline that would be</v>

50
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>needed for his future of role as emperor.</v>

51
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.290
<v Speaker 1>The man that was chosen was counts cower Mara summit,</v>

52
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:20.801
<v Speaker 1>Yoshi,</v>

53
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 1>a retired vice admiral.</v>

54
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>The emperor told tomorrow to raise Hirohito as if he were his own grandson,</v>

55
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.001
<v Speaker 1>Carramar right,</v>

56
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>raised the infants that is mentioned in the hills outside of Tokyo when he was</v>

57
00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>14 months old.</v>

58
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was drawings by his younger brother,</v>

59
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Prince Yasuhito.</v>

60
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Every aspect of the children's lives was carefully overseen including the foods</v>

61
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>they eat and the clothes that they wore,</v>

62
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>but then in November of Nineteen,</v>

63
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:43.571
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

64
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>four calmar had died and suddenly the two boys were reunited with their parents</v>

65
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that the crown princess I Yama Palace.</v>

66
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>The boys were now attended by a series of nurses.</v>

67
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>The main carer,</v>

68
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 1>if Hirohito was a woman named at that sheet Tako,</v>

69
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>who became his surrogate mother.</v>

70
00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito,</v>

71
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>develops into a sedate,</v>

72
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>retiring,</v>

73
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>and insecure Charles as would be expected.</v>

74
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>He was fostered over and pampered from the moments he work each morning.</v>

75
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>This did nothing to develop resilience and independence.</v>

76
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.423
<v Speaker 1>Even in play.</v>

77
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>He was to be shown the Osmos reverence when he ends up the children of the royal</v>

78
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>palace played war games.</v>

79
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>He was always to take the role of the conquering general from the age of four</v>

80
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:22.931
<v Speaker 1>onwards.</v>

81
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito and his brother were indoctrinated into the military heritage of their</v>

82
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>

83
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>They will often taken some military parades and war museums to gaze upon the</v>

84
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>swords of former heroes Hirohito.</v>

85
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>His worldview was builds upon the belief that the entire past,</v>

86
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

87
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and future of the great empire of Japan,</v>

88
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the wisdom of the emperor.</v>

89
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>And so those few advises that he surrounded himself with at the age of seven,</v>

90
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito straining was put in the hands of a hero of the Japanese war named</v>

91
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>General Nogi.</v>

92
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Nogi insisted on strict military discipline,</v>

93
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>refusing to show any deference for the princess position.</v>

94
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Instruction centered on things that were considered essential in a future.</v>

95
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Emperor frugality,</v>

96
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>patients,</v>

97
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>diligence,</v>

98
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>selfcontrol and manliness.</v>

99
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

100
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>he quickly made the young Hirohito come to the realization that he was</v>

101
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.481
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

102
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>we can tap to work hard to develop physical strength.</v>

103
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.451
<v Speaker 1>As instructors,</v>

104
00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:14.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.191
<v Speaker 1>Pierce College,</v>

106
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>we're also told him to give special attention to guiding him in military</v>

107
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

108
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 11,</v>

109
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito had been imbued with a strong sense of reverence for his ancestors.</v>

110
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It was at that age that he officially became a crown prince.</v>

111
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>He was also given the rank of second leftenant in the army a few months later,</v>

112
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and per meg died at the age of 61 and Hirohito.</v>

113
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>His father in Paris had the supreme position in contrast to his own father,</v>

114
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.511
<v Speaker 1>Yoshi.</v>

115
00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>He's proved to be a weak and indecisive emperor.</v>

116
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>As a result of visors came to have more and more sway in the royal court.</v>

117
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Yoshi did not involve himself in state affairs.</v>

118
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>His grandfather's death marks a turning points in the life of the future.</v>

119
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Emperor,</v>

120
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 1>a new phase of his training.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was undertaken with the appointments of a military aid to come to chamberlain</v>

122
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of 13 and 19.</v>

123
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 1>He was given a military and liberal arts education.</v>

124
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a school that had been specially built for him within the confines of</v>

125
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>the tech and now a palace.</v>

126
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It was instructed by the brightest military minds in the lands.</v>

127
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito graduated from the school in Nineteen 21.</v>

128
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.301
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

129
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>he had developed a fascination with biology.</v>

130
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.790
<v Speaker 1>He liked nothing better than collecting seashells and small insects during the</v>

131
00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>school years as teacher of natural history.</v>

132
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a professor Hattori for the next 30 years.</v>

133
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>The story acted as his sermons and all manner of scientific pursuits.</v>

134
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>In 1921 hirohito visited Europe and making him the first Japanese crown prince</v>

141
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.303
<v Speaker 1>He later wrote,</v>

142
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I knew freedom for the first time in England's every move that the young prince</v>

143
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>made while on tour was covered.</v>

144
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Fever initially by the world's press having just returned from his overseas</v>

145
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:55.991
<v Speaker 1>excursion.</v>

146
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was further into the limelight.</v>

147
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>When his father retired his office due to mental illness,</v>

148
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>the future emperor was now the regions he was to retain that this position until</v>

149
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>his father died at the age of 23.</v>

150
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito married his distant cousin,</v>

151
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Princess Aco Cooney.</v>

152
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>He did so against the advice of his advisors who considered her to be an</v>

153
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>unsuitable match for the future.</v>

154
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Emperor two years later,</v>

155
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>with the death of his father,</v>

156
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>his regency ended and he became the emperor</v>

157
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito inherited the throne on December the 25th,</v>

158
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:35.021
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

159
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:35.601
<v Speaker 1>26.</v>

160
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>The 25 year old was now the 124th emperor of Japan.</v>

161
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>This automatically meet him.</v>

162
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>The commander in chief of the armed forces is able to give orders directly</v>

163
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.570
<v Speaker 1>without consulting the cabinets.</v>

164
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>He also became the chief priest of the Shinto Religion,</v>

165
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.760
<v Speaker 1>guiding him in his new political life.</v>

166
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was attended to by a seven member palace entourage of men,</v>

167
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:56.950
<v Speaker 1>much older than himself.</v>

168
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.731
<v Speaker 1>These gathered,</v>

169
00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 1>filtered and disseminated political information to the emperor.</v>

170
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito quickly established a vast network of informants who relayed</v>

171
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 1>information to him on the going ons in every corner of governments,</v>

172
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.220
<v Speaker 1>even has a spy regularly reporting to him on the political activities of his</v>

173
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:12.820
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

174
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Prince Chichibu.</v>

175
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>The new emperor was keen to stamp his footprints on the political landscape is</v>

176
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 1>first acts was to announce a public holiday in remembrance of his grandfather.</v>

177
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Then in an effort to show solidarity with the peasantry during a time of</v>

178
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>agricultural hardship,</v>

179
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>he received at rice plants from all over the empire and staged a ritualistic</v>

180
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:33.730
<v Speaker 1>rice planting events within the palace grounds throughout the year.</v>

181
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.061
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>

182
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:38.710
<v Speaker 1>28 enthronement ceremonies and rituals were carried out in honor of the emperor.</v>

183
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 1>The celebrations climaxed in November and December when hundreds of thousands of</v>

184
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>people participated in banquets and awards ceremonies in the emperor's name.</v>

185
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Millions of men were given to the needy and thousands of prison sentences were</v>

186
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>commuted.</v>

187
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.040
<v Speaker 1>The reign of Herod was designated as show up,</v>

188
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.580
<v Speaker 1>which means enlightened piece from the moments of as ascension.</v>

189
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:00.760
<v Speaker 1>The emperor was no longer to be referred to you by his given name,</v>

190
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>but rather by the title,</v>

191
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.190
<v Speaker 1>His Majesty,</v>

192
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>the Emperor Hirohito came to power during a time of economic hardship.</v>

193
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>The crisis had led to the rise of political power of the military who now had</v>

194
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 1>veto power over his cabinets.</v>

195
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Incidents of political violence were not uncommon.</v>

196
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.090
<v Speaker 1>In 1932,</v>

197
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:19.990
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister in your kit was assassinated and there was an attempt on</v>

198
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito his own life.</v>

199
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 1>In 1932,</v>

200
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 1>this incidence led to a dramatic curtailing of the emperors availability to the</v>

201
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:27.820
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

202
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.670
<v Speaker 1>As Emperor Hirohito followed a disciplines routine.</v>

203
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>He rose at 6:00 every morning to prepare for an English breakfast at seven.</v>

204
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the morning,</v>

205
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.850
<v Speaker 1>he would receive visitors,</v>

206
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.320
<v Speaker 1>enjoy a light lunch at midday,</v>

207
00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:41.350
<v Speaker 1>and then spend the afternoon pouring over and signing documents,</v>

208
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 1>everything to his marriage and the GEICO.</v>

209
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.720
<v Speaker 1>It was a happy one with their only source of anxiety being the failure to</v>

210
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:50.020
<v Speaker 1>produce an APP is advisors urged him to take a concubine,</v>

211
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:51.700
<v Speaker 1>but he resisted this advice,</v>

212
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.400
<v Speaker 1>the couple of ball three daughters before the heir to the throne,</v>

213
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.234
<v Speaker 1>Naca Hito.</v>

214
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>In 1933,</v>

215
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.631
<v Speaker 1>the couple of wind zones,</v>

216
00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 1>you have a total of seven children.</v>

217
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Japan had enjoyed a level of unprecedented growth and prosperity during the 19</v>

218
00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

219
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.131
<v Speaker 1>In essence,</v>

220
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the country existed as a democracy during this period,</v>

221
00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:20.200
<v Speaker 1>which lessens the influence of the military.</v>

222
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 1>This came to an ends with the onset of the depression and during which time the</v>

223
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.610
<v Speaker 1>strong measures advocated by the military leaders began to gain ascendancy.</v>

224
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.440
<v Speaker 1>The unification of neighboring China also fed into the call for a strong</v>

225
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.790
<v Speaker 1>militaristic hands.</v>

226
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.803
<v Speaker 1>In 1931,</v>

227
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the military moved against civilian leaders,</v>

228
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but first they devised a plan to go to war with Manchuria by blowing up a</v>

229
00:09:41.201 --> 00:09:45.160
<v Speaker 1>portion of the south Manchurian railway and they made on the Chinese.</v>

230
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.130
<v Speaker 1>This gave the pretext for an invasion of Manchuria.</v>

231
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.730
<v Speaker 1>The emperor Nazi mentioned the government was completely in the dark about any</v>

232
00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:52.600
<v Speaker 1>of these goings on.</v>

233
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.940
<v Speaker 1>This set the scene for the 19 thirties.</v>

234
00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:58.840
<v Speaker 1>This was a period during which the military pretty much accepts in an arbitrary</v>

235
00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:03.490
<v Speaker 1>fashion when the army began a full scale invasion of China Hirohito orders that</v>

236
00:10:03.491 --> 00:10:04.240
<v Speaker 1>they stop.</v>

237
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.601
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

238
00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>the cabinet managed to persuade the emperor to acquiesce and allow this invasion</v>

239
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.030
<v Speaker 1>to proceed.</v>

240
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito felt powerless to reign in the army,</v>

241
00:10:13.181 --> 00:10:16.090
<v Speaker 1>ever a fearful that doing so would result in his assassination.</v>

242
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.290
<v Speaker 1>In 1932,</v>

243
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.050
<v Speaker 1>he gave the go ahead for the bombing of Shanghai.</v>

244
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.590
<v Speaker 1>The assault was also approved by the Chinese leader Chiang Kai Shek,</v>

245
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>who saw it as an opportunity to put down a rebel group who were based in</v>

246
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.044
<v Speaker 1>Shanghai.</v>

247
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.590
<v Speaker 1>The bombing and subsequent invasion led to tremendous loss of life,</v>

248
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.750
<v Speaker 1>unleashing worldwide condemnation.</v>

249
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was worried that the Americans might respond militarily and told the</v>

250
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.870
<v Speaker 1>army to withdrawal again.</v>

251
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.910
<v Speaker 1>They ignored the commands of their emperor.</v>

252
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.770
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese went onto completely subjugate Shanghai by now mentioned area was</v>

253
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:50.440
<v Speaker 1>completely occupied and had become a Japanese state.</v>

254
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Many Chinese were simply put to death by the occupying force.</v>

255
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.281
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

256
00:10:54.281 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Speaker 1>this broad public condemnation with the League of nations condemning the</v>

257
00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Japanese in response Japan resigned from the League,</v>

258
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.460
<v Speaker 1>despite the emperor is designed to remain within it,</v>

259
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.380
<v Speaker 1>unable to stop the withdrawal.</v>

260
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.460
<v Speaker 1>He insisted that his foreign minister of stress that Japan was determined to</v>

261
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:13.630
<v Speaker 1>work to achieve world peace throughout the 19 thirties spurred by the flexing of</v>

262
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.660
<v Speaker 1>its military muscle.</v>

263
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:18.670
<v Speaker 1>A sense of nationalism grew in Japan that saw a reverence for the Samurai</v>

264
00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:19.181
<v Speaker 1>traditions,</v>

265
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:19.780
<v Speaker 1>volts.</v>

266
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.090
<v Speaker 1>All of this feeds into the worship of the emperor,</v>

267
00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:25.750
<v Speaker 1>which was especially strong among the rank and file of the armed forces.</v>

268
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.310
<v Speaker 1>These soldiers viewed Hirohito as a god and pledged their lives to serve him.</v>

269
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 1>In 1934,</v>

270
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Japan began to enlarge its navy and direct violation of the Washington Naval</v>

271
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Treaty of Nineteen 22 which had restricted it's science to three fifths of the</v>

272
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.403
<v Speaker 1>United States and Great Britain.</v>

273
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

274
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.040
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

275
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was against the move,</v>

276
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 1>but it was not strong enough to stand up to the military.</v>

277
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 1>The flexing of military muscle came to a head in February of 1936 when their</v>

278
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.790
<v Speaker 1>records and uprising led by army officers.</v>

279
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.421
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

280
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito acted decisively.</v>

281
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 1>He ordered the immediate suppression of the revolts along with the execution of</v>

282
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>its instigators,</v>

283
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Aaron.</v>

284
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>He said it was powerless,</v>

285
00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:11.160
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

286
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.620
<v Speaker 1>to stop the growing power of the military.</v>

287
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.880
<v Speaker 1>By 1937,</v>

288
00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:19.440
<v Speaker 1>the situation with China had developed into all out war era who had agreed to a</v>

289
00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Speaker 1>buildup of forces in occupied China in order to stem the tide of communism.</v>

290
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.360
<v Speaker 1>But he soon realized that hostilities were escalating uncontrollably and he</v>

291
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:29.610
<v Speaker 1>insisted that the army pulled back.</v>

292
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.971
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

293
00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>the military bras,</v>

294
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.943
<v Speaker 1>they were not listening.</v>

295
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.160
<v Speaker 1>A full scale attack was made on the Chinese capital of Nan King.</v>

296
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.320
<v Speaker 1>In the wake of the subjugation of Nanking,</v>

297
00:12:37.321 --> 00:12:41.820
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese Army unleashed an orgy of rape and murder that shocked the world</v>

298
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.260
<v Speaker 1>known as the rape of Nanking.</v>

299
00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It resulted in the death of as many as 200,000 Chinese men,</v>

300
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.170
<v Speaker 1>women and children worldwide.</v>

301
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Condemnation for the atrocities of Nan King were heaped upon Japan,</v>

302
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.640
<v Speaker 1>still the armed forces forged on in their attempt to conquer China.</v>

303
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.151
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

304
00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the country was simply too large with the result of the Japanese military was</v>

305
00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:03.450
<v Speaker 1>tied up in a hopeless mission on foreign soil.</v>

306
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.250
<v Speaker 1>For the next four years,</v>

307
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.960
<v Speaker 1>by the outbreak of the Second World War,</v>

308
00:13:06.961 --> 00:13:08.970
<v Speaker 1>the combination of nationalism,</v>

309
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.950
<v Speaker 1>emperor worship and military control had forged a Japan into a nation that was</v>

310
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:16.920
<v Speaker 1>ready and eager to enter hostilities with other nations.</v>

311
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.330
<v Speaker 1>After all going to war was seen as doing the will of the emperor.</v>

312
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.810
<v Speaker 1>The reality was that Hirohito was opposed to the idea of his country going to</v>

313
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:25.230
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

314
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.650
<v Speaker 1>He was a pacifist as heart since was cautious by nature,</v>

315
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.630
<v Speaker 1>but he was simply too weak.</v>

316
00:13:30.631 --> 00:13:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Wills to control the reigns of a military that was chomping at the bit to exert</v>

317
00:13:35.131 --> 00:13:36.870
<v Speaker 1>its controlled throughout the far east.</v>

318
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.730
<v Speaker 1>In September 19,</v>

319
00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:48.061
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

320
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Japan entered into a threeway alliance with Germany and Italy.</v>

321
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.490
<v Speaker 1>This gave the military leaders the confidence do extend its conquests in the Far</v>

322
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:56.550
<v Speaker 1>East.</v>

323
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.720
<v Speaker 1>The first victim would be the French colony of Indochina with the French already</v>

324
00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:02.340
<v Speaker 1>having been beaten by Germany.</v>

325
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It was easy pickings.</v>

326
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.050
<v Speaker 1>The emperor,</v>

327
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:04.411
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

328
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:09.270
<v Speaker 1>was opposed to the move on principle considering it to be like acting as a thief</v>

329
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.313
<v Speaker 1>in a fire.</v>

330
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.280
<v Speaker 1>In 1941,</v>

331
00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Japan signs a nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union.</v>

332
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.780
<v Speaker 1>This gave the military the confidence do extend its occupation into southern</v>

333
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Indochina in response to the United States imposed tough sanctions on the</v>

334
00:14:22.771 --> 00:14:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>

335
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.910
<v Speaker 1>They also put an embargo on all oil exports to Japan.</v>

336
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.020
<v Speaker 1>This move forced Japan's hands with the results that the decision was made to go</v>

337
00:14:31.021 --> 00:14:32.940
<v Speaker 1>to war with the United States.</v>

338
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.601
<v Speaker 1>As usual,</v>

339
00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:34.001
<v Speaker 1>the emperor,</v>

340
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I felt powerless to stop this military juggernaut with the attack on Pearl</v>

341
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Harbor on December seventh,</v>

342
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:40.141
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

343
00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 1>41 war was declared between the United States and Japan Hirohito,</v>

344
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Speaker 1>though not opposing the plan,</v>

345
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 1>the attack has always intended that Japan would declare war before striking.</v>

346
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>You considered the surprise attack on Hawaii as dirty tactics and was extremely</v>

347
00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 1>upset with the military for the manner in which this attack was carried out with</v>

348
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>a much longed for war now upon them all of Japan put their shoulder to the wheel</v>

349
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>in support of victory.</v>

350
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.051
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

351
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>the emperor who had never been an advocate of the war was looked to as the</v>

352
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 1>champion of the Japanese war efforts.</v>

353
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 1>During the first few months of 1942,</v>

354
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Japan won victory after victory.</v>

355
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Malaya Singapore at time,</v>

356
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but then a heavy blue was inflicted when an American bombing raid was unleashed</v>

357
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>upon a number of key Japanese cities.</v>

358
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of midway was the first military defeats and things.</v>

359
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>They simply never recovered.</v>

360
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 1944,</v>

361
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Japan's lost hopes rested with the kamikaze pilots who vowed to die for their</v>

362
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>emperor by crashing their planes into American aircraft carriers,</v>

363
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but this was simply too little,</v>

364
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.480
<v Speaker 1>too late.</v>

365
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was by now eager to see an end star civilities for the first time.</v>

366
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:48.880
<v Speaker 1>He involved himself in the planning of a battle.</v>

367
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.090
<v Speaker 1>If one would force,</v>

368
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>the Americans do propose a peace settlement,</v>

369
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 1>the resulting battle of Okinawa,</v>

370
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.770
<v Speaker 1>so some of the fiercest fighting of the entire war.</v>

371
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

372
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the emperor has planned it backfired.</v>

373
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.490
<v Speaker 1>The American casualties were so high that they despaired that the Japanese would</v>

374
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>ever surrender with American bombs decimating his key cities.</v>

375
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito was ready to put an end to the carnage,</v>

376
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 1>but once again,</v>

377
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 1>he was overridden by his military commanders who vowed to never surrender.</v>

378
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>On August the sixth and ninth,</v>

379
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:19.041
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

380
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:19.850
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>

381
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 1>the Americans dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</v>

382
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Despite the terrible loss of life that resulted,</v>

383
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.470
<v Speaker 1>half of the prime minister's cabinet were opposed to a surrender.</v>

384
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.393
<v Speaker 1>The deadlock.</v>

385
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>It was broken by the emperor.</v>

386
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.530
<v Speaker 1>On August the 15th.</v>

387
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.010
<v Speaker 1>The people of Japan heard the voice of their emperor for the first time.</v>

388
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>He told them that Japan was surrendering to the allies in stating his reasons</v>

389
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.344
<v Speaker 1>for the surrender.</v>

390
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.540
<v Speaker 1>He said with reference to the atomic bomb,</v>

391
00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that a continuation of the struggle would lead to the total extinction of human</v>

392
00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:03.730
<v Speaker 1>civilization before most surrender took place on September.</v>

393
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.800
<v Speaker 1>The second is on board the USS Missouri,</v>

394
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Arizona did not have to suffer.</v>

395
00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:11.530
<v Speaker 1>The indignity of attending Japan was now an occupied country under the</v>

396
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:13.510
<v Speaker 1>management of General Douglas Macarthur.</v>

397
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.110
<v Speaker 1>The emperor expressed a desire to advocate,</v>

398
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but he was persuaded to remain in place by macarthur.</v>

399
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Giving him on the throne would help to provide some semblance of normality.</v>

400
00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:24.550
<v Speaker 1>As Japan emerged from the ashes of war,</v>

401
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.720
<v Speaker 1>the allies drew up a list of 28 top wartime leaders who are culpable of</v>

402
00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:31.120
<v Speaker 1>committing crimes against humanity during the war,</v>

403
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and they put them on trial.</v>

404
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito,</v>

405
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>though it was not among them,</v>

406
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.000
<v Speaker 1>still many pointed the finger at the emperor.</v>

407
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Surely if he was a god,</v>

408
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.810
<v Speaker 1>he could have stopped the atrocities</v>

409
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.070
<v Speaker 1>with announcing pressure.</v>

410
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito spoke to his people for a second time.</v>

411
00:17:54.231 --> 00:17:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Over the radio or Lydia state in 1946 this time,</v>

412
00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.240
<v Speaker 1>what he had to say was even more shocking than his announcement of the</v>

413
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.000
<v Speaker 1>surrender.</v>

414
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.980
<v Speaker 1>He was not a god he told the nation,</v>

415
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.960
<v Speaker 1>but just an imperfect human being just like them in the way of this bombshell</v>

416
00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>announcement.</v>

417
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.940
<v Speaker 1>His title was officially changed from imperial sovereign to constitutional</v>

418
00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:14.600
<v Speaker 1>monarch.</v>

419
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the next few years,</v>

420
00:18:15.651 --> 00:18:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Hirohito made many public appearances.</v>

421
00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:18.200
<v Speaker 1>He taught,</v>

422
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.810
<v Speaker 1>bombed out cities and inspected new factories.</v>

423
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Now he dressed in a suit and tie and looking more like a prime minister from an</v>

424
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.390
<v Speaker 1>emperor Hirohito.</v>

425
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 1>His image was now reshaped into the symbol of the wells to do Japanese middle</v>

426
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.580
<v Speaker 1>class success story.</v>

427
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.660
<v Speaker 1>He was what the ordinary Japanese man could strive to be if you worked hard</v>

428
00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 1>enough free of his imperial duties.</v>

429
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:41.300
<v Speaker 1>The former emperor now had time to indulge his passion for biology.</v>

430
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.590
<v Speaker 1>In the ensuing decades,</v>

431
00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Hito faded into the backgrounds of Japanese significance.</v>

432
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.650
<v Speaker 1>He was increasingly seen as a symbol of the old Japan,</v>

433
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.610
<v Speaker 1>the new Japan.</v>

434
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It was focused on industrialization,</v>

435
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:52.580
<v Speaker 1>consumerism,</v>

436
00:18:52.581 --> 00:18:53.930
<v Speaker 1>and a strong work ethic.</v>

437
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.580
<v Speaker 1>His value was now as a public relations figure who was occasionally wheeled out</v>

438
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.220
<v Speaker 1>and sent around the world on goodwill tours,</v>

439
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.780
<v Speaker 1>still the specs of the passing of the emperor in the mid 19 eighties,</v>

440
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.810
<v Speaker 1>so an outpouring of grief and profound respect among all classes and all ages in</v>

441
00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

442
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but also there was the question of war responsibility,</v>

443
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but the consensus was and remains that Hirohito bore a measure of moral</v>

444
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for the atrocities that were committed in China and through the</v>

445
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Far East in the 19 thirties and forties,</v>

446
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 1>the ends.</v>

447
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.350
<v Speaker 1>It ultimately came on January the seventh,</v>

448
00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:36.651
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

449
00:19:36.651 --> 00:19:37.161
<v Speaker 1>89,</v>

450
00:19:37.161 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 1>the result of God,</v>

451
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.983
<v Speaker 1>no cancer.</v>

452
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.980
<v Speaker 1>The funeral was attended by representatives of 163 nations.</v>

453
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Many have mixed feelings about being bad because of the war responsibility</v>

454
00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:47.780
<v Speaker 1>question great persons.</v>

455
00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Prince Philip later said that he overcame his conscience by not bowing before</v>

456
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:52.551
<v Speaker 1>the emperor.</v>

457
00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:55.250
<v Speaker 1>His casket simply nodding his head slightly,</v>
