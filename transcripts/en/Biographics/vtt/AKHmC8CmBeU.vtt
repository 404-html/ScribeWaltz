00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>When his birthday approached,</v>

144
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>he wrote to his love and his proposed marriage.</v>

145
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Her reply was heartbreaking,</v>

146
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but offered a glimmer of hope.</v>

147
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>She was engaged to another man,</v>

148
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.653
<v Speaker 1>but his latter,</v>

149
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>NATO reconsider.</v>

150
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Edith agreed to meet talking on January the eighth 1913 at the train station in</v>

151
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Shelton.</v>

152
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>They walked and talked for hours and Edith accepted tokens,</v>

153
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>marriage proposal,</v>

154
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>breaking off her prior engagements.</v>

155
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.840
<v Speaker 1>You just converted to Catholicism and the couple married on March the 22nd 1916</v>

156
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was 24 years olds and a few months shy of deploying to the western</v>

157
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 1>front in all.</v>

158
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>That's it to his son,</v>

159
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.671
<v Speaker 1>Michael.</v>

160
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Years later talking expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a</v>

161
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>man with new job.</v>

162
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>There's more money and to know prospects except the likelihood of being killed</v>

163
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>in the great war.</v>

164
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Talking was a true romantic and Edith was his muse.</v>

165
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.333
<v Speaker 1>He wrote to her,</v>

166
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.491
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

167
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>how was raven a skin clear her eyes brighter than you have seen them and she</v>

168
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>could sing and dance talking.</v>

169
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>We're so mad for if he created the fictional power of star crossed lovers based</v>

170
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>on their romance Lithion daughter.</v>

171
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>If the Alvin King of Dory F and Barron a mortal man,</v>

172
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>they fall for each other.</v>

173
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 1>When baron discovers Lithion singing and dancing and a glade.</v>

174
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Yet that love can never be since baron is destined to die.</v>

175
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Alas,</v>

176
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>disapproving father,</v>

177

<v Speaker 1>the King Sends Darren on the task.</v>

178
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>He knows the mat and cannot complete the full story of Leith.</v>

179
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Ian and baron was left unfinished during [inaudible] lifetime,</v>

180
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>but it served an important backstory and the hobbit talking son Christopher</v>

181
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>later published Lithion and baron is a chapter in the saga,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Silmarillion Edith and Toki and enjoyed a long and happy marriage to each</v>

183
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 1>other and they had four children,</v>

184
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>John Francis,</v>

185
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.391
<v Speaker 1>Micheal,</v>

186
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>

187
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.351
<v Speaker 1>Christopher,</v>

188
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

189
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 1>and Priscilla.</v>

190
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Marianne [inaudible] was a devoted father and his loved his children,</v>

191
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>often making up funds for stories for them from 1920 to 1942 at Christmas time,</v>

192
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>talking illustrated letters to his children,</v>

193
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>introducing new characters such as the north polar bear,</v>

194
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 1>snow man and others.</v>

195
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Three years after his death,</v>

196
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>these intimate stories were published as letters from Father Christmas by the</v>

197
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Tolkien estate</v>

198
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>believing he was in his own words,</v>

199
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.710
<v Speaker 1>a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.</v>

200
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Talking did not rush to join the British military when war broke out.</v>

201
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

202
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.440
<v Speaker 1>he returned to Oxford where he had achieved a first class degree in June of 1915</v>

203
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Tolkien was busy working on poems and his invented languages at this time.</v>

204
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.271
<v Speaker 1>Eventually though,</v>

205
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>talking enlisted as a second leftenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers and was sent</v>

206
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.250
<v Speaker 1>to active duty on the western front just in time for the battle of the Somme,</v>

207
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.230
<v Speaker 1>also known as the Somme offensive.</v>

208
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of the Somme remains one of the bloodiest military battles in</v>

209
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:31.120
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

210
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It lasted for long months and on the first day alone,</v>

211
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 1>British troops suffered over 57,000 casualties in total.</v>

212
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Over a million men lost their lives,</v>

213
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:45.220
<v Speaker 1>including 420,000 British soldiers fighting in the great war,</v>

214
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>talking witness the horrors of trench fighting and lived in deplorable and</v>

215
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 1>sanitary conditions.</v>

216
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It was hell on earth for Tolkien and his comrades who stood by as their friends</v>

217
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>suffered and died them.</v>

218
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>They spend their days and nights with little relief and endured infestations of</v>

219
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>lice that feasted on their flash.</v>

220
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

221
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>talking came down with trench fever,</v>

222
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>a major medical problem of world war one so severe with a licensed captain</v>

223
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>staying with talking's units.</v>

224
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Later recalls we dos down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep,</v>

225
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>but it was not to be,</v>

226
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>we no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up,</v>

227
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>so we went round in the medical officer who was also in the dog house with this</v>

228
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 1>equipment and t gave us some ointments which he assured us would keep the little</v>

229
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:25.974
<v Speaker 1>bricks away.</v>

230
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>We anointed it ourselves all over with the stuff and to gain lay down in great</v>

231
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

232
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was not to be because instead of discouraging them,</v>

233
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.540
<v Speaker 1>it seems to act like a kind of hoarder of the little beggars went at their feast</v>

234
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>with renewed vigor,</v>

235
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>sick and is unable to fight.</v>

236
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>He's talking left the battle front to recover in a Birmingham Hospital in</v>

237
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:49.131
<v Speaker 1>November of 1916 through 1917 and 1918 talking had bouts of the illness and he</v>

238
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>spent time in remission doing service at home and at various camps talking most</v>

239
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 1>likely escaped death on the battlefronts precisely because he became ill,</v>

240
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 1>sadly all but one of his close friends,</v>

241
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>including those from the tcbs perished in the war as a writer.</v>

242
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>This tragedy of loss and firsthand experience in battle provided.</v>

243
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Talking with a keen sense of awareness from the unpublished,</v>

244
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the book of loss tails talking,</v>

245
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:17.280
<v Speaker 1>writes in huts full of blasphemy and smart or by candle light and bell tense,</v>

246
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>even some down in dug outs on the shelf in the hobbits,</v>

247
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the five armies.</v>

248
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It's thought to draw upon talkings wartime experiences as well as the dead</v>

249
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>marshes and black gauge of mortar in the Lord of the rings.</v>

250
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>On November the 11th 1918 the armistice was signed,</v>

251
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.970
<v Speaker 1>which marks the end of World War One.</v>

252
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Duncan was appointed assistant lexicographer Ron,</v>

253
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the new English dictionary,</v>

254
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 1>also known as the Oxford English dictionary in 1918 but stayed on the job for</v>

255
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>only a short while.</v>

256
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of 1920 he accepted a post as a reader with the University of</v>

257
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Leeds Leeds.</v>

258
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 1>He taught and collaborated with other authors,</v>

259
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 1>continued writing the book of loss tails,</v>

260
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 1>constructed languages,</v>

261
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>and founded reading and social clubs like the Viking club.</v>

262
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 1>This was an undergraduate club for Stevens who had an affinity for old Norse</v>

263
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Sagas and drinking.</v>

264
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

265
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.320
<v Speaker 1>In 1925 talking that finally received his professorship at Oxford.</v>

266
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 1>The Rawlinson man's Bosworth professorship,</v>

267
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Anglo Saxon talking,</v>

268
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>was right at home in academia and fit in remarkably well with the predominantly</v>

269
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>male culture.</v>

270
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.880
<v Speaker 1>He reveled in the lectures,</v>

271
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 1>research and exchange of ideas with students and fellow professors.</v>

272
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Talking did not publish many scholarly articles yet he was extremely</v>

273
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:29.424
<v Speaker 1>influential.</v>

274
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>One lecture worth mentioning altered the modern study of the old English epic</v>

275
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:33.421
<v Speaker 1>tale,</v>

276
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Baerwolf and twist first delivered in 1936 in Baerwolf,</v>

277
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>the monsters and the critics talking argued the monsters,</v>

278
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:40.861
<v Speaker 1>Grendel,</v>

279
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Grendel's mother and the Dragon,</v>

280
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>or not merely extraneous to the narrative,</v>

281
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but should be a focus of study.</v>

282
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Talking believed critics,</v>

283
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but too much emphasis on the historical elements of the tail.</v>

284
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Instead of looking at it as a work of art as Oxford,</v>

285
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.600
<v Speaker 1>talking to friends and colleagues,</v>

286
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.231
<v Speaker 1>cs Lewis,</v>

287
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>best known for his fantasy series,</v>

288
00:11:58.061 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>the chronicles of Narnia,</v>

289
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 1>the two men bonded over their shared love of mythology and it's began meeting</v>

290
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 1>regularly for a glass,</v>

291
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 1>a joke,</v>

292
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 1>and to criticize each other's poetry.</v>

293
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 1>The meetings were so enjoyable and useful,</v>

294
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>they invited others to join.</v>

295
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>The informal group known as the inklings,</v>

296
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>eventually grew to 19 members and to the mass once a week late at night,</v>

297
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>sometimes not wrapping up until two or three o'clock in the morning as well as</v>

298
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the practice talking shared manuscripts of works in progress with the inklings</v>

299
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 1>and received energetic feedback from the group.</v>

300
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Among other ratings.</v>

301
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Talking brought original poetry sections from the Hobbit,</v>

302
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 1>excerpts from the notion club papers and each new chapter of the Lord of the</v>

303
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:35.650
<v Speaker 1>rings.</v>

304
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>There is little evidence to support the suggestion by some that the men had a</v>

305
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.620
<v Speaker 1>more spiritual purpose to them.</v>

306
00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:41.454
<v Speaker 1>Meetings,</v>

307
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the inklings continued to meet regularly for 19 years.</v>

308
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Together with talking and Louis,</v>

309
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>some of the more distinguished members of the infant's included Neville</v>

310
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:50.861
<v Speaker 1>Cockatiel,</v>

311
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Hugo Dyson,</v>

312
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Owen Barfield and Charles Williams.</v>

313
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.690
<v Speaker 1>In 1945 talking changed as chair at Oxford do the Merton professorship of</v>

314
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 1>English language and literature.</v>

315
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>He held this position until his retirement in 1959</v>

316
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 1>one hot summer day in 1928 professor talking was grading exam papers,</v>

317
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>which he described as soldiers drying.</v>

318
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>He came upon a blank page and without thought wrote down in a hole in the</v>

319
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

320
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They lived a Hobbit,</v>

321
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.561
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

322
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:22.930
<v Speaker 1>what was a hobbit and why did it live in the grounds?</v>

323
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Well talking,</v>

324
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>you need to define the answers to these questions.</v>

325
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.763
<v Speaker 1>He said later,</v>

326
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>names always generate a story.</v>

327
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>In my mind I thought I'd better find out what hobbits were like.</v>

328
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Then injury,</v>

329
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>talking fashion,</v>

330
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the dive headlong into the creative process and concocted a tale to tell his</v>

331
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.170
<v Speaker 1>younger children and share amongst the inklings.</v>

332
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>In 1936 and incomplete copy of the hobbit wound up in Susan diagonals,</v>

333
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 1>hands and employee of the publishing firm,</v>

334
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.891
<v Speaker 1>George Allen,</v>

335
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:49.750
<v Speaker 1>and when recognizing the stories,</v>

336
00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 1>potential dagnall convinced talking to finish it and complete it,</v>

337
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>she presented it to her boss.</v>

338
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 1>He then tested it out on his 10 year old son who gave us a raving review.</v>

339
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Ours was published one year later in 1937 and it was an immediate test.</v>

340
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.270
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

341
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Speaker 1>it was so successful that the publisher asked Toking if he has any similar</v>

342
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 1>stories today.</v>

343
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Since the first publication,</v>

344
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit has sold more than 100 million copies around the wells and has been</v>

345
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 1>translated in over 50 languages.</v>

346
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.091
<v Speaker 1>So you might be wondering,</v>

347
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:19.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

348
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:20.680
<v Speaker 1>what makes the hobbits so endearing?</v>

349
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.311
<v Speaker 1>For one thing,</v>

350
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 1>it lacks female characters and it is not,</v>

351
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 1>nor has it ever been politically correct.</v>

352
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 1>It is also a very long tail with poetry and unlike other children's fiction,</v>

353
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 1>does not have a central child figure for whom young readers can easily identify</v>

354
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

355
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Although the protagonist Bilbo Baggins is only a little hobbit,</v>

356
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>so he does kind of acts like a surrogate child.</v>

357
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Talkings colorful descriptions of middle earth and it's complex characters,</v>

358
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:44.681
<v Speaker 1>goblins,</v>

359
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:45.101
<v Speaker 1>elves,</v>

360
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:45.491
<v Speaker 1>orcs,</v>

361
00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:45.941
<v Speaker 1>wizards,</v>

362
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:46.541
<v Speaker 1>dragons,</v>

363
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>and hobbits of course,</v>

364
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>are richly portrayed and for all the fantasy writers you came after talking</v>

365
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 1>hardly any can say their wells were not,</v>

366
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

367
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 1>influenced by the hobbits.</v>

368
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 1>But what set the story apart is the depth of emotion and moral courage talking</v>

369
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>weaves into his heroic fiction.</v>

370
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>There are examples of this throughout the Hobbit,</v>

371
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>including the death of Dwarf leader,</v>

372
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Thorin,</v>

373
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.703
<v Speaker 1>Okin shields.</v>

374
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 1>There's also build those internal struggle to do what's right,</v>

375
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>betraying his friends while they tried to reclaim the lonely mounds in from</v>

376
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:16.821
<v Speaker 1>Smok,</v>

377
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>the dragon bill by fields and obsessive greed has overtaken Thorin and when</v>

378
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>builder finds the Arkenstone the greatest treasure of all,</v>

379
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>he decides to first hide it and then give it to his friends procedures to be</v>

380
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:30.080
<v Speaker 1>used as a bargaining chip in the ends.</v>

381
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo exposes himself and confesses because after all,</v>

382
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 1>they are friends.</v>

383
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>After talking's publication of the hobbyist,</v>

384
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 1>he presented portions of the Silmarillion including incomplete stories of</v>

385
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Lithion and baron to Stanley and when hoping for a warm reception,</v>

386
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>but his reader Phelps the stories when not commercially publishable,</v>

387
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 1>they simply contains too much poetry.</v>

388
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Talking was disappointed of the news,</v>

389
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>but soon found himself busy writing the sequel to the hobbyist talkings opus.</v>

390
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>What would become the Lord of the rings?</v>

391
00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>This was first published in three parts,</v>

392
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:00.710
<v Speaker 1>the fellowship of the ring,</v>

393
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:01.371
<v Speaker 1>the two towers,</v>

394
00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:06.371
<v Speaker 1>and the return of the king between 1954 and 1955 it took him over a decade to</v>

395
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 1>write these books and wind son who was by now an adult,</v>

396
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 1>was heavily involved in pushing a temperamental talking to finish the books,</v>

397
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 1>thinking it would be a relatively unimpressive release and they lost the from</v>

398
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 1>the publishers grossly underestimated the Lord of the rings.</v>

399
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.523
<v Speaker 1>Public Appeal,</v>

400
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 1>true is had mixed reviews from damning to glowing and everything in between.</v>

401
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>The BBC adapted it into 12 condensed episodes,</v>

402
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 1>elevating its popularity further.</v>

403
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Then in the mid 1960s a pirated paperback version was released,</v>

404
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 1>which caught the attention of American readers,</v>

405
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 1>sort of cults then developed based on the new founds popularity of fantasy</v>

406
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 1>literature and talking was made a rich man.</v>

407
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.910
<v Speaker 1>He was not entirely happy though,</v>

408
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.080
<v Speaker 1>even if he was flatus,</v>

409
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 1>partly because rumors circulators of party going culture readers ingesting LSD</v>

410
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and reading the Lord of the rings and indeed some overzealous fans who talking</v>

411
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>referred to as lunatics.</v>

412
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.250
<v Speaker 1>We're calling his home and demanding to know if Frodo has succeeded as his</v>

413
00:16:59.251 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>quest,</v>

414
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 1>the hobbies and the Lord of the rings certainly receive all the glory,</v>

415
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but talking authored a number of other articles and essays during his lifetime,</v>

416
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:09.530
<v Speaker 1>including the monsters and the critics and other essays.</v>

417
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>One middle earth related work,</v>

418
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 1>the adventures of Tom Bombadil editions and translations of Middle English works</v>

419
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.450
<v Speaker 1>such as the [inaudible],</v>
