00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.210
<v Speaker 1>During the Holocaust.</v>

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It was a cock lived in the book and wild concentration camp with our husbands.</v>

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.100
<v Speaker 1>She would order the deaths of prisoners at a will and even enjoyed watching</v>

4
00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:13.000
<v Speaker 1>people being tortured and kills her home was filled with momentos,</v>

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>made from human skin and it was a call come had been responsible for more deaths</v>

6
00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>than your average serial killer.</v>

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.521
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

8
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>she is considered to be one of the most evil women that ever lived</v>

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>bone with a maiden name.</v>

10
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Margaret also color her life,</v>

11
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>had humble beginnings in Dresden,</v>

12
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Germany as the trials.</v>

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>No one could have ever guessed that she would grow up to be such an evil person.</v>

14
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Neighbor say that she was a friendly,</v>

15
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>happy girl and she was popular in school.</v>

16
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Her father was a laborer and her mother was a housewife just like on the German</v>

17
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:53.601
<v Speaker 1>girl Zillow.</v>

18
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Zillow would have known to cook and clean and take care of a household.</v>

19
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>She left school to start working at a cigarette factory fulltime when she was 15</v>

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>she began taking classes in accounting.</v>

21
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a local college and and bookkeeping position.</v>

22
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It also joined the Nazi party very early on,</v>

23
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>most likely because she came from a poor family.</v>

24
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis promise the lower class that they could help bring Germany out of the</v>

25
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>economic depression that they were experiencing off to world war one.</v>

26
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>For people who are poor and an educated fascism seems like a solution to the</v>

27
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>country's problems.</v>

28
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>I said began to believe in the ideals of an area in master race and Shannon that</v>

29
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>feelings of antisemitism.</v>

30
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>She mentioned like minded men who would become a future husbands call a cock.</v>

31
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>He was nine years older than El Sarah and had already gone through a divorce</v>

32
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>from his first wife who disagreed with his Nazi philosophies.</v>

33
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>He had a criminal record for theft and he and his brother grew up working as</v>

34
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>informants for the police.</v>

35
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>There's life of grime was actually something that builds the thought was quite</v>

36
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>attractive and they were married in 1936 often Hitler came to power.</v>

37
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>The couple were rewarded for being early adopters of Nazi-ism went from being a</v>

38
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>petty criminal to being handed a position as a high ranking ss officer.</v>

39
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>The two of them that have a up with any sort of wealth and they suddenly had the</v>

40
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to become rich and powerful,</v>

41
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>and so they took advantage of it to its fullest extent.</v>

42
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Before he was put in charge of a concentration camp,</v>

43
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Carl Koch was the warden of a prison in Berlin.</v>

44
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>He would force prisoners deep stuff themselves into dog houses and eat out of</v>

45
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>bowls.</v>

46
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>They were supposed to kneel and Bach when coke was around.</v>

47
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>If they refuse,</v>

48
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>they will be soon.</v>

49
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>If a man did something wrong,</v>

50
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>hot tar was shoved up his backside.</v>

51
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>This sadistic torture was noted by the Nazis and they thought his unique skill</v>

52
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>

53
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it could be useful of running a camp filled with the enemies of the Third Reich.</v>

54
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.521
<v Speaker 1>It was a cock,</v>

55
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>wasn't turned off by the brutal reputation that her husband had.</v>

56
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

57
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>she loved us and she wants it to be a part of the process as much as her husband</v>

58
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

59
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>When she found out they were going to be running a concentration camp together.</v>

60
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>She even got some practice where I get to prison camp,</v>

61
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.880
<v Speaker 1>cold Sachsenhausen Call Elsa Coq.</v>

62
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>One interesting charge of managing the book involves concentration camp.</v>

63
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>They were there during the construction of it,</v>

64
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>the gate to the camp red yet m dust sign,</v>

65
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>which means to each his own.</v>

66
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>What they meant by this was that everyone gets what's coming to them.</v>

67
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>This was their own personal touch to rabbit into the faces of those people who</v>

68
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>they truly believed.</v>

69
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Does it have to be treated less than human beings?</v>

70
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Book involved was the largest of all the Nazi concentration camps and yet there</v>

71
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>were no gas chambers for killing people quickly and efficiently.</v>

72
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>This camp was mainly there to use the prisoners as slave labor,</v>

73
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>making things that were useful to the Third Reich.</v>

74
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Prisoners in book involves were kept alive for years,</v>

75
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>which was a lot longer than it.</v>

76
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Other concentration camps in Auschwitz.</v>

77
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:43.661
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

78
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>the average lifespan was Amea three to four months while they were building the</v>

79
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>camp bills and request the family must live in a mansion which was built on the</v>

80
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>same property as the concentration camp in Nazi Germany.</v>

81
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Men and women were given set roles to play in society.</v>

82
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>The perfect gentleman woman was supposed to be happy to do housework.</v>

83
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>She was supposed to stay strong in the face of adversity and always loyal to her</v>

84
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>husband's high ranking leaders in the Nazi policy.</v>

85
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>We're expected to be a good example of this.</v>

86
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Wives of SNS offices were not expected to do the work as much as a common German</v>

87
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

88
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but it also Cochran Kritika new life of luxury to the next level.</v>

89
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>She aims to have a life where she never had to do any housework.</v>

90
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>She decided that the prisoners from the concentration camps would be how slaves.</v>

91
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>She forced everyone to address Sarah as Kinetica Frau,</v>

92
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 1>which is an old fashioned to,</v>

93
00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually reserved for ladies of nobility.</v>

94
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Elsa never lifted a finger to do anything herself,</v>

95
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>which may to grow bored with her life.</v>

96
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>She decided that the prisoners should build out a huge indoor sports arena.</v>

97
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>They looked worthy of an Olympic event.</v>

98
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>This was used just so she could practice a hobby of horseback riding.</v>

99
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It costs over 200,000 Reichsmarks to bills today.</v>

100
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>That would be about the equivalent of $1 million,</v>

101
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but all of this back riding,</v>

102
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't enough to satisfy a boredom.</v>

103
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a rule in the camp that if any prisoner even looked at the commander's</v>

104
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>wife,</v>

105
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they would be shot on the spot.</v>

106
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Knowing this Elsa Cochran,</v>

107
00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>again dressing provocatively on purpose,</v>

108
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>she wore tight clothing and reveal to our cleavage on a daily basis.</v>

109
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Most wives of the SS officers and the other concentration can never go to</v>

110
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>involved with the prisoners and where most likely in some sorts of denial about</v>

111
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>what was going on,</v>

112
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.373
<v Speaker 1>but it was the cock.</v>

113
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to get involved and she relished in the fact that people were</v>

114
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>starving and dying all around time.</v>

115
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Elsa was about some reds hatch.</v>

116
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>He thought a lot of ourself witnesses say that when her husband was away,</v>

117
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>it'll sokak would come on to the officers to bring out a group of male soldiers</v>

118
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>and forced them to undress until they were completely naked.</v>

119
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>She would all say stripped down to our lingerie and loud in front of a yard of</v>

120
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>sec staff to male prisoners.</v>

121
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>If any of them even glanced at her about eur uncontrollably became aroused.</v>

122
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>He was immediately taken by the gods and shot in the hat.</v>

123
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>She specifically requested to have teenage boys working in our home.</v>

124
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Seven so you lived in house say that she was holding them to bring her breakfast</v>

125
00:05:59.121 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>in bed.</v>

126
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>She would be laying in bed wearing nothing but a nightie,</v>

127
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.140
<v Speaker 1>just like the men in the yards.</v>

128
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 1>If they even dads look at that body.</v>

129
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It was grounds for them being killed considering they were well,</v>

130
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>teenage boys,</v>

131
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible that some of them simply couldn't help get aroused.</v>

132
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Even if they hated our guts.</v>

133
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Based on these stories,</v>

134
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>we can make the assumption that she was a sexual sadist who is aroused by the</v>

135
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>idea of inflicting pain upon other people.</v>

136
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.841
<v Speaker 1>One of the households,</v>

137
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.411
<v Speaker 1>sevens,</v>

138
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Eric Hush was just 15 years old at the time that he works,</v>

139
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>that he said that the coc dimension was on the edge of the camp,</v>

140
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>so he was able to look out the window and see free people beyond the fence</v>

141
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>watching people go about their lives.</v>

142
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It felt like looking at some kind of fantasy and t often fails envious and sad.</v>

143
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Wondering why he wasn't so lucky.</v>

144
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Elsa cock allowed him to each two boiled potatoes every Sunday.</v>

145
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He would carry them back to the barracks where the other prisoners were staying.</v>

146
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like eating potato skins so it would peel them off and throw them on</v>

147
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:53.541
<v Speaker 1>the grounds,</v>

148
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:54.374
<v Speaker 1>but once he did that,</v>

149
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.910
<v Speaker 1>several other prisoners jumped on the pills because they were so desperate for</v>

150
00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:58.110
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

151
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.943
<v Speaker 2>figures.</v>

152
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.150
<v Speaker 1>All Nazi concentration camps had some form of human experimentation going on and</v>

153
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>work involved was no exception.</v>

154
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Doctors at the camp were poisoning people with deadly chemicals in order to find</v>

155
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>potential antidotes and they were injecting homosexuals with concoctions that</v>

156
00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:21.120
<v Speaker 1>were believed to turn them straight.</v>

157
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

158
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.910
<v Speaker 1>teasing then was not enough to satiate hills is boredom and she wanted to watch</v>

159
00:07:26.911 --> 00:07:28.830
<v Speaker 1>the doctor's conduct these experiments.</v>

160
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.830
<v Speaker 1>She saw this as an opportunity to have a new hobby.</v>

161
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.740
<v Speaker 1>She wrote a story through the camp and notice that some of the prisoners had</v>

162
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.390
<v Speaker 1>really interesting tattoos.</v>

163
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.130
<v Speaker 1>She approached one of the camp doctors,</v>

164
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:38.911
<v Speaker 1>Eric Wagner,</v>

165
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:42.570
<v Speaker 1>and suggested that he should conduct a study to see if tattoos had any</v>

166
00:07:42.571 --> 00:07:44.130
<v Speaker 1>correlation to criminal behavior.</v>

167
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>

168
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Wagner should have never said yes because it was against protocol,</v>

169
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but he agreed to do it.</v>

170
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>During these tests,</v>

171
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 1>people were killed and their bodies were taken away to be dissected so that Elsa</v>

172
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.610
<v Speaker 1>could keep this skin.</v>

173
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Also began writing a whole surround the camp commodity men to stop what they</v>

174
00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:01.320
<v Speaker 1>were doing and strip.</v>

175
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.420
<v Speaker 1>She would walk through the lines of naked men,</v>

176
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>sizing them up and examining their bodies.</v>

177
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 1>But the ones with what she regarded as the best tattoos were selected for the</v>

178
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:10.620
<v Speaker 1>medical trial and they were killed.</v>

179
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Their skin was used to cover a lampshades knife sheaths and book covers.</v>

180
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 1>She saw this as an opportunity to come up with some original Christmas gifts and</v>

181
00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 1>commands and a group of Jewish prisoners to do the work of creating huge</v>

182
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:25.410
<v Speaker 1>quantities of these trinkets made from human leather during the holidays.</v>

183
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:28.710
<v Speaker 1>She would send them to ss officers who were in charge of the other concentration</v>

184
00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:29.310
<v Speaker 1>camps.</v>

185
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>One Room even says that she used human body parts all over our house,</v>

186
00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:35.820
<v Speaker 1>like using thumbs as light switches.</v>

187
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.980
<v Speaker 1>According to prisoners who worked in our house,</v>

188
00:08:37.981 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Elsa was having affairs with both Dr Waldemar Hoeven and deputy commandant,</v>

189
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

190
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.590
<v Speaker 1>and floor statue one call.</v>

191
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Cock was asked to leave.</v>

192
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:47.400
<v Speaker 1>The comfort is Nazi duties.</v>

193
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.070
<v Speaker 1>She would reportedly stay overnight to doctor Hovind's home.</v>

194
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.100
<v Speaker 1>He was known for conducting medical experiments on human beings.</v>

195
00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:58.101
<v Speaker 1>So it was just a type when cold cock contracted civil se or did the execution of</v>

196
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the orderly who gave him his diagnosis.</v>

197
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>He did not want anyone to know the embarrassing truth about this marriage.</v>

198
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Some believe that they had an open relationship</v>

199
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>in 1942 both Carl and Elsa Kakoa taken to courts misappropriating the funds of</v>

200
00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>the book involved camp and for the over the top methods of torture if we're</v>

201
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:22.811
<v Speaker 1>being honest.</v>

202
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's surprising that it took that long for the Nazis to ask where the money came</v>

203
00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:30.070
<v Speaker 1>from to build else's whole stadium and for the lavish lifestyle that she</v>

204
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>demanded.</v>

205
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Many of the human experiments going on at Buka and roles were often made up on a</v>

206
00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:35.500
<v Speaker 1>whim by the Cox.</v>

207
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.490
<v Speaker 1>This was not allowed in the audit to begin a scientific trial would have to have</v>

208
00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 1>come from higher up in the Nazi party.</v>

209
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Medical experiments using human subjects usually has an actual goal that would</v>

210
00:09:45.761 --> 00:09:46.331
<v Speaker 1>help the Fed.</v>

211
00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

212
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.441
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

213
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:51.790
<v Speaker 1>the experiments usually prove that areas where the master race or the disabled</v>

214
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:55.600
<v Speaker 1>people who are somehow subhuman the party wants to experiments that helps to</v>

215
00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:57.760
<v Speaker 1>justify the genocide that they were conducting,</v>

216
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the torturing and killing prisoners just to look at their tattoos could ever be</v>

217
00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:03.790
<v Speaker 1>justified from by the Nazis.</v>

218
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it also was the one who convinced the Dr. Wagner to disobey</v>

219
00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:09.670
<v Speaker 1>protocol shows just how manipulative she was.</v>

220
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.630
<v Speaker 1>She has every man in her life wrapped around her finger and she seemed to take</v>

221
00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:17.320
<v Speaker 1>no issue with ruining that career is if it meant getting the things she wanted</v>

222
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>often being removed from that post.</v>

223
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:20.890
<v Speaker 1>A man named Herman Pisco took over.</v>

224
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Book Involves Elsa,</v>

225
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.051
<v Speaker 1>has been called,</v>

226
00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:27.700
<v Speaker 1>was put in jail awaiting their trial in 1944 the cock sweat finally taken to</v>

227
00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

228
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>The Nazi judge concluded that no matter how manipulative Elsa may have been that</v>

229
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.820
<v Speaker 1>responsibility nade on Carl.</v>

230
00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:34.660
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

231
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.890
<v Speaker 1>he was the Kimono or off roll and he should've had the final say and both the</v>

232
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.220
<v Speaker 1>manner of killing and the campus well as the use of funds.</v>

233
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.460
<v Speaker 1>The judge suspended the charges against still syringe set.</v>

234
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:46.420
<v Speaker 1>A free call,</v>

235
00:10:46.421 --> 00:10:46.840
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

236
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.890
<v Speaker 1>was not so lucky.</v>

237
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.090
<v Speaker 1>He was sentenced to death for his crimes and in 1945 he was shot by firing</v>

238
00:10:52.091 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>squad.</v>

239
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Elsa was free to go even though her demands it directly contributed to our</v>

240
00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:58.000
<v Speaker 1>husband's death.</v>

241
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.900
<v Speaker 1>She seemed to show no remorse and she was even able to go back to living a</v>

242
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:02.531
<v Speaker 1>normal life.</v>

243
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>In Germany with our three children that same year,</v>

244
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.330
<v Speaker 1>American troops freed the prisoners of bouquet involves,</v>

245
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>they invited German people in Weimar to come inside so that they could witness</v>

246
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:12.670
<v Speaker 1>what had been going on in the camp.</v>

247
00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:13.504
<v Speaker 1>Right next door,</v>

248
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 1>they saw 80,000 people crammed into a space meant to house 8,000 corpses lying</v>

249
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:23.380
<v Speaker 1>around in front of the crematory and American soldiers discovered a horrifying</v>

250
00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 1>collection of human body parts including several human organs displayed inside</v>

251
00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:28.180
<v Speaker 1>of gloss cases.</v>

252
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.780
<v Speaker 1>There was shrunken heads and they found household items that were covered in</v>

253
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:32.614
<v Speaker 1>human skin.</v>

254
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.480
<v Speaker 1>The allies took testimonies from prisoners who had lived in Bougainville</v>

255
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:36.340
<v Speaker 1>involved for years,</v>

256
00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:38.890
<v Speaker 1>and when they heard the stories of Elsa Cock,</v>

257
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.200
<v Speaker 1>she was arrested for crimes against humanity.</v>

258
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>At the trial,</v>

259
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it'll sir insisted that all of the objects were made from goatskin,</v>

260
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.173
<v Speaker 1>not humans,</v>

261
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:46.681
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

262
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:48.820
<v Speaker 1>that many of them really did have tattoos on them.</v>

263
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.331
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

264
00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:52.840
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole crew of Jewish prisoners who testified that the entire,</v>

265
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>they worked at the camp.</v>

266
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>It was their job to butcher human bodies and skin and make them into these</v>

267
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 1>trinkets upon else's request.</v>

268
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Even though there were tons of photographs proving there's all of these objects</v>

269
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>truly did exist.</v>

270
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 1>There was no proof that Elsa cock or did these objects to be made.</v>

271
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>There was only the testimony of witnesses and that was considered heresay while</v>

272
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:13.331
<v Speaker 1>she was in jail.</v>

273
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:17.070
<v Speaker 1>In 1947 she became pregnant after having an affair with a fellow jam and</v>

274
00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>prisoner.</v>

275
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth to our son and was forced to give him away after he was born.</v>

276
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>In the video footage of the trial.</v>

277
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.440
<v Speaker 1>She looks indignant and angry without showing a single ounce of remorse for hot</v>

278
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>pot in the Holocaust.</v>

279
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>The United States military governor named General Lucius d clay believed that</v>

280
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't enough physical evidence to sentence her to death and he could only</v>

281
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>give her four years of hard labor instead,</v>

282
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 1>and she served her time.</v>

283
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.640
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

284
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 1>West Germany was not done with her.</v>

285
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

286
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.240
<v Speaker 1>as soon as she was out of prison,</v>

287
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 1>she went on trial for our crimes,</v>

288
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 1>a third and final time,</v>

289
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>and she was given a life sentence.</v>

290
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 1>There was a particular witness,</v>

291
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:53.081
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Morgan,</v>

292
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 1>who testified at all three of Elsa Cox trials.</v>

293
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>He later told the New York Times that she was a Hussy.</v>

294
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 1>He rode horseback and sexy underwear in front of the prisoners and the noted</v>

295
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 1>down for punishment.</v>

296
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>The numbers of those who looked at at Sheila rounds in our garden in front of</v>

297
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>

298
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>simply primitive,</v>

299
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>but she had nothing to do with the lampshade business and she did not deserve</v>

300
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 1>such a draconian punishments.</v>

301
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>She was a victim of horror stories.</v>

302
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Keep in mind to that that was the person who was supposed to be defending our</v>

303
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 1>character Ilsa call cad for children during her lifetime.</v>

304
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Her two daughters and one of our sons was raised in the camp.</v>

305
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:26.411
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

306
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>they were far too young to understand the situation as a child.</v>

307
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.900
<v Speaker 1>When a son odd fin grew older and learned just how much the world hated the Cox</v>

308
00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

309
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>He felt he couldn't escape the guilt and shame and so he killed himself a</v>

310
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:38.951
<v Speaker 1>daughters.</v>

311
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 1>They were able to get married,</v>

312
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>change their names and try to move on with their lives.</v>

313
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.410
<v Speaker 1>There's another she was forced to give away,</v>

314
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:45.610
<v Speaker 1>was named Ooh column.</v>

315
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>He spends his entire life being passed around to different foster homes and</v>

316
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>never got to experience having a real family.</v>

317
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>When he was 19 he was working as an insurance salesman and decides that he wants</v>

318
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you to know his parents where he got ahold of his birth certificate.</v>

319
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He figured out who his mother was and read about how tron and the newspapers</v>

320
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>after building up the courage he visited and I are in prison.</v>

321
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 1>She was very happy to see him.</v>

322
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>She rarely if ever,</v>

323
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>received any visitors since,</v>

324
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

325
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.370
<v Speaker 1>oldest son was dead and to do daughters at a strange themselves.</v>

326
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It also told to the,</v>

327
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 1>to everything bad said about it was a complete lie.</v>

328
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>He knew that since she had helped run a concentration camp,</v>

329
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't be completely innocent,</v>

330
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 1>but he still desperately wanted a relationship with his mother and he loves her</v>

331
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:25.684
<v Speaker 1>unconditionally.</v>

332
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>He began visiting a once a month,</v>

333
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.930
<v Speaker 1>uconn.</v>

334
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I've never pushed his mother to talk very much about world war two and just</v>

335
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get to know her as a person.</v>

336
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.420
<v Speaker 1>After a few of these visits,</v>

337
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>he became convinced that his mother could not possibly have committed such</v>

338
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 1>horrific crimes.</v>

339
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>She tried to convince him to get a lawyer to set her free,</v>

340
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.000
<v Speaker 1>but it could not be done.</v>

341
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>It was 1967 when she was 61 years old.</v>

342
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>She realized that it was our last hope to manipulate one more person to get what</v>

343
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>she wants it and she failed.</v>

344
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So she tied her bed sheets together and a jail cell and she hung herself in 1971</v>

345
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.531
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

346
00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Cola approached the New York Times.</v>

347
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you tell his mother's version of her own story?</v>

348
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And also that told him that those damn liberal American courts were the only</v>

349
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 1>ones who did not give her a fair trial.</v>

350
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times was eager to demystify the lies that Elsa had told you.</v>

351
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Kona,</v>

352
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>as we mentioned earlier,</v>

353
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 1>the Americans actually did dismiss the claims because of his essay,</v>

354
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.670
<v Speaker 1>and it was the Germans who committed to that,</v>

355
00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:19.504
<v Speaker 1>to life in prison.</v>

356
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Despite all his attempts to publish our lives and exonerate his mother,</v>

357
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.620
<v Speaker 1>no one was buying it.</v>

358
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.011
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

359
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 1>truly was the final victim of how manipulation.</v>
