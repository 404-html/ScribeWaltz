<v Speaker 1>Maximilian Robespierre promised you Asha,</v>

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>a fairer,</v>

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>more representative form of government to the French people.</v>

4
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>What they got instead was a reign of terror that saw thousands facing the horror</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.323
<v Speaker 1>of the guillotine.</v>

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Among his victims were the king and Queen of France.</v>

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>When justice finally came,</v>

8
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it was a swift as the slice of a blade in this week,</v>

9
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:21.601
<v Speaker 1>spire graphics.</v>

10
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.601
<v Speaker 1>We Wade into the terror with a biography of Maximilian Robespierre Maximilian</v>

11
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre</v>

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 1>ends of the world on May the sixth 1758 he was born and harass froms.</v>

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Historians have suspected for centuries that is family originated from Ireland.</v>

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>By the time the Max was born,</v>

15
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>though they had been at French citizens for many generations.</v>

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>The child was conceived out of wedlock,</v>

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>but by the time he was born,</v>

18
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>his parents had gotten married like his own father before him.</v>

19
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:04.451
<v Speaker 1>Max.</v>

20
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>His father was a lawyer,</v>

21
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>but not for a very successful one.</v>

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>This left the family with a constant desks hanging over their heads.</v>

23
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Things didn't get any easier for the rubber SBE as when Max,</v>

24
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:16.361
<v Speaker 1>his mother died,</v>

25
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>giving birth to a sibling when he was only six years old.</v>

26
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Looking after four children was too much for Robert sps seniors,</v>

27
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>so his offspring were divided among his relatives.</v>

28
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>His mother's death had a profound impact upon the young Max.</v>

29
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.910
<v Speaker 1>No longer was he the carefree child of old.</v>

30
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>He was Sullen and he was serious.</v>

32
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He also applied himself diligently to his schooling as if he was drowning his</v>

33
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>grief with his studies.</v>

34
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>When he was 11 years of age,</v>

35
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>young Robespierre was awarded a scholarship to the least see Louie la grounds in</v>

36
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

37
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>He would continue studying there for the next 12 years emerging at age 23 with a</v>

38
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>law degree as well as law.</v>

39
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He also studied literature or rhetoric and the classics life at the prestigious</v>

40
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

41
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It was very structured,</v>

42
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 1>formerly a Jesuit institution.</v>

43
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>There was now under the control of the University of Paris.</v>

44
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>The day began and ended with formal prayers and Bible study.</v>

45
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The school also has an excellent library,</v>

46
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>which Robespierre made liberal use of the most well known incidents arising from</v>

47
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre is time at the school of cards when he was 17 his excellence oratory</v>

48
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>skills led them to being selected to give a speech before King Louis the 16th</v>

49
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 1>and Queen Marie Antoinette.</v>

50
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>He perfected his wording and practices delivery only to be snubbed by the role</v>

51
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>couple who never even bothered to get out of the carriage.</v>

52
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a personal violation and one that he would never forget during his time</v>

53
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:41.671
<v Speaker 1>of the light.</v>

54
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Sear Robespierre was also exposed to enlightenment philosophy,</v>

55
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 1>especially the works of Jacques Rousseau.</v>

56
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Rousseau was powerful advocates for a more democratic form of government coupled</v>

57
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>with social empowerment's.</v>

58
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.030
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

59
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Maximilian was not able to read Rousseau in the library of the school.</v>

60
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>His works were considered to be dangerous and so copies of his famous discourse</v>

61
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>published 20 years earlier had to be smuggled in in his later life.</v>

62
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre would label his later years of the lacy as a nursery for</v>

63
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>republicanism.</v>

64
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>By the time he had reached his early twenties Robespierre was a vocal advocate</v>

65
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.530
<v Speaker 1>for natural rights.</v>

66
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>He champions the rights of the underprivileged speaking as every opportunity.</v>

67
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.091
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

68
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>he was such an enthusiastic champion of basic human rights that he became</v>

69
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>physically exhausted to the point of collapse.</v>

70
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre proved to be an unstoppable force of nature.</v>

71
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>This led to him becoming a familiar as well known figure in and around his</v>

72
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.324
<v Speaker 1>hometown.</v>

73
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>In the mid seventies and eighties he joined the academy a verace.</v>

74
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>His first speech before the academy was part of a competition and Sean a</v>

75
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>spotlight upon the lack of morality and politics.</v>

76
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>It didn't win first prize,</v>

77
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but he was rewarded with a large cash prize.</v>

78
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>This wet his appetites and over the next few years he ended a number of essay</v>

79
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and poetry competitions.</v>

80
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>He also joins and elites literary society known as the Receiver Year Club.</v>

81
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Since his graduation with a degree in law,</v>

82
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre had established a moderate practice from the very start.</v>

83
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>He began taking on cases that were controversial in 1789 he took on the state in</v>

84
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:21.451
<v Speaker 1>a case that directly challenged the notion of lead tray to cache or imprisonment</v>

85
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>without trial.</v>

86
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.371
<v Speaker 1>During the trial.</v>

87
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:29.371
<v Speaker 1>He actually wrote to the king and personally requested his assistance in getting</v>

88
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>rid of this abuse.</v>

89
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 1>By the seventies and eighties France was desperately running out of money.</v>

90
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>They had spent a lot of money and assisting the Americans in the previous</v>

91
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

92
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>This was compounded by a lavish amount of spending on the part of the monarchy,</v>

93
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>VA appointments of a succession of finance.</v>

94
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Ministers do try and turn arounds.</v>

95
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>The country's economy has little effects.</v>

96
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the decade,</v>

97
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>there was a growing call for a meeting of the estates general representing the</v>

98
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>clergy,</v>

99
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>the inability and the people.</v>

100
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.651
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

101
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>the king unilaterally enacted a series of laws to fill the royal coffers.</v>

102
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>This included the raising of taxes and the cutting of spending on essential</v>

103
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.244
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

104
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.941
<v Speaker 1>The following day,</v>

105
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the French parliament condemns the king's actions labeling the raising of taxes</v>

106
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>as illegal.</v>

107
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>The king's response where stu simply exile the parliaments.</v>

108
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

109
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>as you might expect to lead,</v>

110
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>do growing protests in Paris.</v>

111
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 1>In response to this desperate situation,</v>

112
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>a new finance minister was put in place.</v>

113
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.821
<v Speaker 1>This minister,</v>

114
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>it was [inaudible].</v>

115
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He proposed a new five year plan,</v>

116
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>which was designed to restore French credit as well as presenting a full</v>

117
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>accounting of the French government's finances to whoever wanted to see it.</v>

118
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>He called for the return of the Parisians parliaments after their normal autumn</v>

119
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

120
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.630
<v Speaker 1>The parliaments reconvenes November the 17th 1787 in the rare presence of the</v>

121
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>

122
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>After an eight hour debates,</v>

123
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>the parliament failed to authorize brands five year plan.</v>

124
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>However it King Louis the 16th went ahead and authorize the loans that were</v>

125
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>needed to restore credit.</v>

126
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

127
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>the king left the chamber,</v>

128
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but the debate continued.</v>

129
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It was resolved that the parliament would officially condemn the king's actions.</v>

130
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.581
<v Speaker 1>The following day.</v>

131
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>The leading members of parliaments were exiled by the king and response to this</v>

132
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>provincial parliaments across the country began to refuse to register laws as a</v>

133
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>protest to the apparently does spotting actions if the king on May the third</v>

134
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.420
<v Speaker 1>1788 the parliaments of Paris issued a declaration on the fundamental laws of</v>

135
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>the realm is included.</v>

136
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>The rise of parliaments who registered new laws,</v>

137
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the role of the estates General Lens,</v>

138
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of all subjects from arbitrary arrest.</v>

139
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>

140
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of the parliaments,</v>

141
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>they were taken into custody and lead the following day.</v>

142
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 1>A few days later,</v>

143
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>the king issued a series of judicial reforms which were designed to to cement</v>

144
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>his absolute power.</v>

145
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>The reforms effectively neutralized the parliaments of Paris in response to this</v>

146
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>outrage prevents your parliaments around the country refuse to uphold any of the</v>

147
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 1>government's laws.</v>

148
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>France was now operating without any formal justice system.</v>

149
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>The country was approaching widespread public revolts and then attempts to</v>

150
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>control the damage.</v>

151
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Finance Minister Brianne calls for a sitting of the estates general on May the</v>

152
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 1>first 1789 meanwhile,</v>

153
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>the French government was complete the bankrupt with no ideas to get the country</v>

154
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>out of the red.</v>

155
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Brianne was forced to resign and former finance minister Jack Neck was put back</v>

156
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>in office and the general confidence of the people and managed to recall the</v>

157
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>parliaments around the country.</v>

158
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>The Paris parliaments announced that the estates general would meet according to</v>

159
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 1>the historic precedent where the representation of the people,</v>

160
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the third estate would be numerically less than that of the clergy and the</v>

161
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:04.664
<v Speaker 1>nobility.</v>

162
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>This was something that was met with widespread public disapproval,</v>

163
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>three long negotiations with the king.</v>

164
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I was able to announce in December of 1788 that the representation of the third</v>

166
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:17.750
<v Speaker 1>estate would be doubled and the estates general.</v>

167
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

168
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of pamphlets had been appearing around Paris with titles such as what</v>

169
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 1>is the third estate rather than being comprised of peasants,</v>

170
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>workers or artisans.</v>

171
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>The third estate was made up of lawyers and office holders,</v>

172
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>the well to do who had enough time to engage in the Slo process involved.</v>

173
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>The pamphlet is strongly criticized the power of the clergy and the nobility and</v>

174
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>the lack of representation of the masses.</v>

175
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Several leaders arose among the third estate and that included Maximilian</v>

176
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre.</v>

177
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>By 1788 Robespierre was positioning himself to play a key role in the coming</v>

178
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

179
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>He participated a series of debates regarding the makeup of the third estate and</v>

180
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>the ratio of the three components of the estates general.</v>

181
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>He published a pamphlet which address local issues and arrest with the view of</v>

182
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>getting himself elected onto the third estate and the pamphlets.</v>

183
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>He strongly stressed.</v>

184
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Two key ideas,</v>

185
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the importance of elected representation and they concern for the poor.</v>

186
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.091
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

187
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Robert [inaudible] has a clearly defined notion of who the enemy was and that</v>

188
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>was the clergy and the nobility.</v>

189
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 1>In March of 1789 he was elected as a representative from our ass to the third</v>

190
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>

191
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 1>He was chosen to participate in the drafting of a list of grievances.</v>

192
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

193
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>he pushed for new incentives that would give the lower classes access to the</v>

194
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>political system.</v>

195
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre is seconds.</v>

196
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Pamphlet was a foretaste of things to come.</v>

197
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It was called the enemies of the country on masked</v>

198
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.581
<v Speaker 1>the estates.</v>

199
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.440
<v Speaker 1>General mats on the 5th of May,</v>

200
00:10:00.441 --> 00:10:02.360
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 1789 at first sight,</v>

201
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.010
<v Speaker 1>30 year old robbers spear was one of eight representatives from a wraps and the</v>

202
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:08.690
<v Speaker 1>formal opening of proceedings.</v>

203
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.770
<v Speaker 1>He and his fellow third estate members refused to now before the king.</v>

204
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.780
<v Speaker 1>That first day Robespierre,</v>

205
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.890
<v Speaker 1>he began to stand out.</v>

206
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.990
<v Speaker 1>He was not an imposing physical figure and his voice was less than inspiring,</v>

207
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:25.991
<v Speaker 1>but he dressed impeccably and had an amazing ability to recall details.</v>

208
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.700
<v Speaker 1>He customarily wore a powdered wig and they formal waistcoat.</v>

209
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.370
<v Speaker 1>In the first week of the assembly,</v>

210
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>he forms a breakaway group known as the Breton Club,</v>

211
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.020
<v Speaker 1>which held their own meetings to discuss the abolition of the privileges of the</v>

212
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>clergy and the nobility.</v>

213
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.020
<v Speaker 1>On June the seventh Robespierre gave a passionate speech criticizing the</v>

214
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>excesses of the clergy.</v>

215
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.460
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the major motivators for the establishment of the National</v>

216
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Assembly.</v>

217
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Three days later on [inaudible],</v>

218
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.710
<v Speaker 1>the third estate sent messages to the clergy and nobility requesting that they</v>

219
00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>agree to common verification by headcounts are receiving no response.</v>

220
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.560
<v Speaker 1>They declared themselves the only legitimate representative body renaming</v>

221
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.030
<v Speaker 1>themselves the comments.</v>

222
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>The public received this news with great enthusiasm.</v>

223
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Eventually the clergy under much public pressure joins the National Assembly on</v>

224
00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 1>the morning of June the 20th at the National Assembly turns up to their meeting</v>

225
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:19.761
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

226
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Of a sign to find the gate's locked sins.</v>

227
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.360
<v Speaker 1>The entrance man's by guards.</v>

228
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>They quickly retreated to a nearby tennis courts on the grounds of a side.</v>

229
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.330
<v Speaker 1>The members were enraged at the desk.</v>

230
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Pot isn't of the king and shutting out the National Assembly.</v>

231
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 1>They unanimously asserted what has become known as the tennis court oath.</v>

232
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They vowed to remain in session until the constitution of the realm and public</v>

233
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>regeneration are established and assured.</v>

234
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.570
<v Speaker 1>On June the 17th the king opens the role session.</v>

235
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.930
<v Speaker 1>His first move was to declare the National Assembly and valid.</v>

236
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 1>He then put forward a 35 point plan for reform.</v>

237
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>His final move was to announce this.</v>

238
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that the estates general did was valid without his personal consent.</v>

239
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

240
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Once the king had dismissed the assembly,</v>

241
00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the nobility and clerics filed out,</v>

242
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.780
<v Speaker 1>but the members of the National Assembly comprising the third estate and the</v>

243
00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:20.580
<v Speaker 1>clergy remained where they were.</v>

244
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It was declared that they would only leave at the end of bear nets with the</v>

245
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:27.750
<v Speaker 1>entire country in support of the National Assembly.</v>

246
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.470
<v Speaker 1>The king,</v>

247
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.303
<v Speaker 1>he backed down.</v>

248
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.570
<v Speaker 1>He owns it the first and second to states to join the National Assembly.</v>

249
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Still the riots.</v>

250
00:12:34.951 --> 00:12:38.850
<v Speaker 1>They did not end Louis send troops to surrounds the city of Paris,</v>

251
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the National Assembly,</v>

252
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and now I've got to work and hammered out a list of demands to be the king.</v>

253
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre was one of those who presented them with the first one being that he</v>

254
00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:48.570
<v Speaker 1>removed the trips,</v>

255
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the king.</v>

256
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.460
<v Speaker 1>He ignored the demands.</v>

257
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.990
<v Speaker 1>By the beginning of July,</v>

258
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:54.960
<v Speaker 1>there were 20,000 soldiers around the city.</v>

259
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre responded by making a public statement.</v>

260
00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.490
<v Speaker 1>No one loves the arms missionaries.</v>

261
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.800
<v Speaker 1>The first lesson of nature and it's prudence,</v>

262
00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:03.900
<v Speaker 1>is to repulse them as necessary.</v>

263
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And so it proved to be on July the 11th the king dismissed finance minister neck</v>

264
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>out who was still publicly popular.</v>

265
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.470
<v Speaker 1>This led to rage among the people.</v>

266
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.430
<v Speaker 1>A few days later,</v>

267
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.290
<v Speaker 1>rumors spread like wildfire that the French army was a bouncer launch from</v>

268
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 1>attack on the people and mobs of citizens reacted to the impending days by</v>

269
00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:26.060
<v Speaker 1>seizing at 28,000 rifles from a veteran's hospital.</v>

270
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.990
<v Speaker 1>They now needed gunpowder to use them,</v>

271
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.890
<v Speaker 1>and as they found it,</v>

272
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>it's an unused prison in the city called the bass steel.</v>

273
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.720
<v Speaker 1>The guards tried to hold off the crowds,</v>

274
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:38.721
<v Speaker 1>but then fired into the hundreds of people fell down debt the now out of control</v>

275
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:42.380
<v Speaker 1>and mob overpowered and killed the guards and then gained access to the gun</v>

276
00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:43.050
<v Speaker 1>powder.</v>

277
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.940
<v Speaker 1>When the king sent soldiers to bring order,</v>

278
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.550
<v Speaker 1>they switched loyalties and they've joined the people.</v>

279
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Louie now new particular trust.</v>

280
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

281
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.230
<v Speaker 1>not even it's protective army.</v>

282
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

283
00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:53.970
<v Speaker 1>the National Assembly,</v>

284
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>they remained in session in a desperate attempt to restore order the king</v>

285
00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.950
<v Speaker 1>reappointed neck out,</v>

286
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.030
<v Speaker 1>but the finance minister refuse to work with the National Assembly and was</v>

287
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:05.340
<v Speaker 1>unable to stem the flow of rebellion.</v>

288
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm July the 19th he king road through Paris and a carriage along with key</v>

289
00:14:09.271 --> 00:14:12.270
<v Speaker 1>members of the national assembly including Robert Spi APP.</v>

290
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Rather than crying hours long live the king,</v>

291
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.540
<v Speaker 1>the people called out long live liberty long live the nation.</v>

292
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Let me try to play,</v>

293
00:14:19.521 --> 00:14:23.700
<v Speaker 1>keep the crowns by telling them that he had ordered the troops to withdraw the</v>

294
00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:27.270
<v Speaker 1>$150,000 citizens who flooded the streets,</v>

295
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.580
<v Speaker 1>took it as too little too late.</v>

296
00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Though across the country,</v>

297
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.620
<v Speaker 1>armed mobs were taking to the streets with many of them seizing control of their</v>

298
00:14:34.621 --> 00:14:35.520
<v Speaker 1>city governments.</v>

299
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Starving people broke into grand juries and the estates of their landlords</v>

300
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.490
<v Speaker 1>helping themselves to food and provisions while other members of the National</v>

301
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Assembly express concern that the growing chaos Robespierre saw insurrection as</v>

302
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:49.820
<v Speaker 1>the national expression of the People's.</v>

303
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

304
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 1>it was those who opposed revolution who are actually the real threat.</v>

305
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.800
<v Speaker 1>He became fanatical in his results.</v>

306
00:14:56.801 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

307
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>we doubt any and all who shaped dissent to the apparent well of the people.</v>

308
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

309
00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:15.960
<v Speaker 1>the National Assembly began working on a new constitution,</v>

310
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the declaration of the rights of man and the citizen was voted on August the</v>

311
00:15:20.131 --> 00:15:24.090
<v Speaker 1>26th the king didn't respond to the declaration in till October,</v>

312
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.390
<v Speaker 1>by which time the riots in the streets were still ongoing.</v>

313
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.140
<v Speaker 1>He expressed concerns at a number of the articles in the declaration.</v>

314
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.123
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

315
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.860
<v Speaker 1>he called the Alif Flanders Regimen to society,</v>

316
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.540
<v Speaker 1>provide extra protection.</v>

317
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:40.200
<v Speaker 1>On the morning of October the fifth a large group of market women marched on</v>

318
00:15:40.201 --> 00:15:40.801
<v Speaker 1>velocity,</v>

319
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:42.120
<v Speaker 1>demand flour and grain.</v>

320
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.140
<v Speaker 1>They were met at the gates by Robert's pm who while showing empathy for their</v>

321
00:15:46.141 --> 00:15:46.974
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

322
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.270
<v Speaker 1>advised caution.</v>

323
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.910
<v Speaker 1>He managed to negotiate for a single woman to meet the king lear.</v>

324
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.140
<v Speaker 1>We agreed to allow the release of two stores of grain,</v>

325
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.310
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

326
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.860
<v Speaker 1>for Louis it was too little too late.</v>

327
00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.820
<v Speaker 1>By evening,</v>

328
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.100
<v Speaker 1>a massive crowd had gathered at Versailles.</v>

329
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Many of the moms,</v>

330
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.560
<v Speaker 1>they lingered throughout the night.</v>

331
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.371
<v Speaker 1>Then early on,</v>

332
00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:08.850
<v Speaker 1>the morning of October the sixth a group of them managed to break in to the</v>

333
00:16:08.851 --> 00:16:09.720
<v Speaker 1>queen's bedroom.</v>

334
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Meridian managed to escape,</v>

335
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but to have her gods were killed,</v>

336
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.560
<v Speaker 1>but there were a couple were forced to leave the palace and seek refuge in an</v>

337
00:16:16.561 --> 00:16:17.880
<v Speaker 1>unused palace in Paris,</v>

338
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.870
<v Speaker 1>the Erie,</v>

339
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.170
<v Speaker 1>they will follow that by a crowd of 60,000 people.</v>

340
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.310
<v Speaker 1>The king and queen spend the next few months as virtual prisoners in the palace</v>

341
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.210
<v Speaker 1>power rested with the National Assembly among Ridge Rubbers.</v>

342
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 1>P has influence with having more prominence over the next year.</v>

343
00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:35.730
<v Speaker 1>The assembly works towards a constitutional monarchy.</v>

344
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.870
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1791 the king had had enough along with his wife.</v>

345
00:16:39.871 --> 00:16:42.930
<v Speaker 1>He disguised himself as a servant and fledge in the carriage.</v>

346
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.890
<v Speaker 1>He left behind the documents which clearly denounced the national assembly.</v>

347
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.000
<v Speaker 1>The carriage journey got 160 miles outside of Paris and then they were taken</v>

348
00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:52.200
<v Speaker 1>back to the palace.</v>

349
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

350
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.750
<v Speaker 1>The night after the king's attempts to flee the country,</v>

351
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre gave an impassioned speech in which he stated that the deadliest</v>

352
00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:11.560
<v Speaker 1>enemies of the French when the Austrians,</v>

353
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:16.590
<v Speaker 1>he threatened war but counter revolutionary forces within France itself.</v>

354
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>He also said that the king should be counted as one of those enemies of the</v>

355
00:17:21.011 --> 00:17:21.730
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>

356
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.563
<v Speaker 1>This speech,</v>

357
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.270
<v Speaker 1>it broke the assembly into on the one side,</v>

358
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:29.080
<v Speaker 1>there were those who clung to the idea of a constitutional monarchy.</v>

359
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

360
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.420
<v Speaker 1>those who sided with Robespierre,</v>

361
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.370
<v Speaker 1>we're in favor of republicanism.</v>

362
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre.</v>

363
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.420
<v Speaker 1>He began to call for the public trial of the king on July.</v>

364
00:17:37.421 --> 00:17:41.620
<v Speaker 1>The 17th or group of petitioners who supported the call were confronted by the</v>

365
00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:45.190
<v Speaker 1>national guardsmen and the melee that followed 50 of them were killed.</v>

366
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 1>The French constitution was completed in September of 1791 effectively putting</v>

367
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:52.530
<v Speaker 1>an end to the work of the assembly.</v>

368
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre resent to harass where he was welcomed as a hero of the people.</v>

369
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.691
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

370
00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:59.730
<v Speaker 1>the king had declared war on Austria.</v>

371
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre spoke out against the war stating that it was not in the interests</v>

372
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:07.860
<v Speaker 1>of the people and he feared that it would galvanize them around the king and</v>

373
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 1>thus destroy the revolution.</v>

374
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.780
<v Speaker 1>During the spring of 1792 there were vocal calls for the creation of a French</v>

375
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:15.630
<v Speaker 1>republic.</v>

376
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre,</v>

377
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

378
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 1>had changed his tune and was now in favor of a constitutional monarchy.</v>

379
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.031
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

380
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>when a large protest outside between early on,</v>

381
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>the third anniversary of the tennis court,</v>

382
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>oath turns nasty.</v>

383
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 1>He found himself in a standoff with the kings key enforcer,</v>

384
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 1>General Lafayette,</v>

385
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.190
<v Speaker 1>who stood ready to put down the marches with force protests at the tweeter.</v>

386
00:18:36.191 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>He continued culminating in the king and queen being forced to flee and seek</v>

387
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:41.370
<v Speaker 1>protection from the National Assembly.</v>

388
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 1>More than a thousand people were killed that night and it's way the monarchy was</v>

389
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>officially dissolved in the royal family were taken into custody as prisoners of</v>

390
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:51.384
<v Speaker 1>the state.</v>

391
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Following these events,</v>

392
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Robert's be app was elected to the insurrection commune,</v>

393
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:09.240
<v Speaker 1>which was the governing body which now kept order in Paris.</v>

394
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.070
<v Speaker 1>He oversaw a period of interrogation of royalists for a raft of suspected crimes</v>

395
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:14.904
<v Speaker 1>against the state.</v>

396
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Many of these royalists prisoners were pulled from their prison cells by mobs</v>

397
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 1>and simply massacred.</v>

398
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 1>This is where I'm simply handed to eventual mob is after mock trials in the</v>

399
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:26.040
<v Speaker 1>first week of September,</v>

400
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 1>1970 to around 1,400 people were killed by these mobs.</v>

401
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre insisted the commune also investigate counter revolutionary</v>

402
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:38.670
<v Speaker 1>activities so it would condemned 28 people to death by the heading.</v>

403
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 1>In the midst of this carnage,</v>

404
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 1>elections were held for a new constitutional assembly.</v>

405
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Rubber spear was elected as a first deputy.</v>

406
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Still there where those within the assemblies that's rejected to his violent</v>

407
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 1>methods of enforcements through force or arguments here sidelines than winning</v>

408
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the day with his conviction that the ends justified the means,</v>

409
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 1>no matter how violent the means may be the trial of the king.</v>

410
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll have again on December the 26th 1792 three weeks later,</v>

411
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 1>he was found unanimously guilty.</v>

412
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre himself sums up the will of the Times.</v>

413
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>It is where the regrets that I must pronounce the fatal truth that King must die</v>

414
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.590
<v Speaker 1>so that the country may live.</v>

415
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 1>France executed it's king.</v>

416
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:26.450
<v Speaker 1>On January the 21st 1793 Robespierre he did not attend to the occasion.</v>

417
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 1>On July the 20th 1793 Robespierre was elected to the committee of public safety,</v>

418
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 1>which had been established just a few months earlier.</v>

419
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 1>The committee began to take action against federalist revolutionists.</v>

420
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Mass executions were ordered in Leo,</v>

421
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 1>which was a hotbed of royalists sympathy.</v>

422
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Revolts were breaking out all over leading the convention to declare terror.</v>

423
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 1>The order of the day on September the 17th they pass laws,</v>

424
00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to put to death.</v>

425
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who was implicated as a supporter of tyranny caught up in the net of the</v>

426
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:09.610
<v Speaker 1>reign of terror was Marie Antoinette's.</v>

427
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>After a sham trial,</v>

428
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:15.570
<v Speaker 1>she was sent to the guillotine on October the 16th 1793 Robespierre.</v>

429
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>He now set his sights on his former National Assembly,</v>

430
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 1>opposes the girder nests.</v>

431
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>They were do you need tried and found guilty and sent to the Guillotine?</v>

432
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Controlling all of these executions was rubbers Pierre,</v>

433
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 1>who famously declared to punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency to</v>

434
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>forgive them is barbarity.</v>

435
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Those who were opposed Robespierre in the assembly found themselves facing the</v>

436
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 1>guillotine.</v>

437
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Before long he had absolute power within the committee.</v>

438
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.880
<v Speaker 1>He had become a virtual dictator literally with the power of life and death in</v>

439
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:50.970
<v Speaker 1>his hands along with his immense power.</v>

440
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre grew increasingly paranoid.</v>

441
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Then there was an attempt on his life in May of 1793 the following month he was</v>

442
00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>elected president of the convention.</v>

443
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He immediately enacted changes to allow him to condemn even more people to</v>

444
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:04.110
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

445
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] were reduced to mere condemnations and all accused were denied legal</v>

446
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

447
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.380
<v Speaker 1>He even created a new category of criminal gold enemy of the people.</v>

448
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 1>This blanket term could cover anything from serving sour wine.</v>

449
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Do sending a letter to England.</v>

450
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:19.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

451
00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 1>it's the punishments.</v>

452
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>It was always the same death by guillotine.</v>

453
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.070
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

454
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre had gone too far.</v>

455
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.290
<v Speaker 1>The people were beginning to reject his despotic rule of terror.</v>

456
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.060
<v Speaker 1>His political enemies orchestrator,</v>

457
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:43.230
<v Speaker 1>they falsified lesser,</v>

458
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:46.350
<v Speaker 1>which appeared to implicate Robespierre and an attempted coup to Tom.</v>

459
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 1>He defended himself against charges of dictatorship in a two hour speech.</v>

460
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.181
<v Speaker 1>In this speech,</v>

461
00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:54.510
<v Speaker 1>she warned of a conspiracy that was being hatched against the republic,</v>

462
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.340
<v Speaker 1>but it was all to no avail.</v>

463
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.320
<v Speaker 1>The next day he was arrested or needs to be freed.</v>

464
00:22:58.321 --> 00:22:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

465
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.900
<v Speaker 1>like trips from the Paris commune,</v>

466
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Robert's Vn and his defenders found themselves hold up at the Hotel de Ville.</v>

467
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.410
<v Speaker 1>They were declared outlaws by the convention,</v>

468
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.980
<v Speaker 1>which means that when course they could be put to death immediately when the</v>

469
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:14.180
<v Speaker 1>convention forces closed in on the hotel rather SBM,</v>

470
00:23:14.181 --> 00:23:16.920
<v Speaker 1>and as those who were with him all tried to commit suicide,</v>

471
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>some of them succeeded,</v>

472
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:19.980
<v Speaker 1>but Robespierre has attempts to blow out.</v>

473
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.630
<v Speaker 1>His brain's only managed to shatter his lower jaw with blondes pouring from his</v>

474
00:23:24.631 --> 00:23:25.110
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

475
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Robespierre was laid on the table in the room of the committee for public safety</v>

476
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.950
<v Speaker 1>before being transferred to the cell that is housed Maria,</v>

477
00:23:31.951 --> 00:23:34.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to ask prior to her date with a guillotine,</v>

478
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the end game for Robespierre on July the 28th 1794 when he became the final</v>

479
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:41.190
<v Speaker 1>victim of his reign of terror,</v>

480
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.750
<v Speaker 1>seconds before the blade fell,</v>

481
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 1>the executioner ripped off the bandage that keeping his jaw together,</v>

482
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>causing him to let out an all mighty scream.</v>

483
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It was soon silenced by the deadly blade.</v>

484
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Finally ending the carnage that Robespierre has warped view of justice had</v>

485
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.350
<v Speaker 1>wrought.</v>
