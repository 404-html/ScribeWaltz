1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.140
For 11 years.
He hosted one of the most popular art shows on television,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.490
transforming a blank canvas to a finished painting in a remarkably short,

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.324
30 minutes.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.380
He captivated audiences with is mesmerizing voice and is relaxed demeanor.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.580
And of course his signature palm nearly 25 years after his death.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.900
The painter of happy little trees is immortalized through Internet memes,

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
inspirational quotes,
say thriving business in his name and reruns of the show,

8
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:30.690
the joy of painting his famous a pop culture icon shows no sign of diminishing.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
Yes,
so little is known about his life today on biographics,

10
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.300
we pieced together the world of Bob Ross beyond the canvas.

11
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
Wilbur Ross was fiercely privates and never reveal details of his personal life.

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.380
He gave very few interviews claiming no one bothered to ask him.

13
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.130
Looking for answers is especially difficult considering that no official

14
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.990
biography of his life exists from primary sources,
the ones documentary,
Bob Ross,

15
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:08.070
the happy there can only be obtained by pledging money to PBS or getting a hold

16
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:10.830
of a DVD.
Copy the book happy clowns,
happy trees.

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.390
The Bob Ross phenomenon admitted that their text is about an understanding.

18
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.640
We have of Bob Ross and his life.

19
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
If we had wanted to write an accurate biographical book on Bob Ross,

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.230
that goal would be difficult to to accomplish adding to the elusive Ross.

21
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.580
He was said to have very few friends and they out of respect,

22
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.820
I only ever conducted interviews for the Afa mentioned documentary that is not

23
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.590
readily or widely available.

24
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.400
Facts are hard to come by and nearly impossible to verify.

25
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.210
Still some specifics are known and so far remain undisputed.

26
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.770
So here's what we know.

27
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.890
Robert Bob Norman Ross was born on October the 29th of 1942 in Daytona Beach,

28
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:53.780
Florida to Jack a builder and competency alia waitress when Ross was just a year

29
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.550
and a half folds his parents divorced and Ross moved to Orlando.

30
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.460
Not much is known of Ross's childhoods in Orlando.

31
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.030
Save for two defining moments as a freshman in high school,

32
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:06.870
Ross wanted to drop out in order to work as a carpenter alongside his father.

33
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.100
Around this same time,

34
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.450
Ross suffered an accident losing the tip of his left index finger on a saw
blade.

35
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.840
Ross must've been self conscious about his deformed hands for the rest of his

36
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:20.100
life on his hit television show.
The joy of painting Ross carefully disguised it,

37
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.830
holding his pains,
pallets so that it remains shielded from view.

38
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:23.760
Most of the time,

39
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.900
Ross was known to be an animal lover his entire life as a youngster.

40
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.480
This may have been passed on from his mother as a teenager.

41
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.070
Ross allegedly kept exotic paths including armadillos and alligators later on in

42
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:35.610
his life.

43
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.210
His pet gray squirrel sometimes made an appearance on his television show.

44
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.000
Ros One said,
if we're going to have animals around,

45
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.060
we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.

46
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.330
Bob Ross married twice during his life and had three sons.

47
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.160
He married his first wife,
Linda Brown,

48
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
early on in his military career and they divorced in 1981 the couple had two

49
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:56.130
sons,
Bob junior and Steven.

50
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.490
Steven would follow in his father's footsteps and became a certified Bob Ross

51
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:04.570
painting instructor Ross,
his second wife,
Jane,
was a civilian in Alaska.

52
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.160
They had one son,
Morgan,
who would also become an accomplished artist.
Sadly,

53
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.000
Jane died from cancer in 1993 and Ross did not remarry

54
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.520
long before his time on public television.

55
00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:23.630
Ross was in the military at the age of 18 Ross joins the United States air force

56
00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:27.380
and within a few years he was uprooted from his native Florida and sent to an

57
00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.900
entirely unfamiliar place.
Fab Banks,

58
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.370
Alaska Ross spent the next 20 years of his life in Alaska working,

59
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.600
raising a family and developing a love of painting amidst the majestic
mountains,

60
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.550
towering pines and crystal clear waters examining Ross's paintings over his

61
00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:47.660
lifetime.
One can see without question,
the trees,
peaks,
valleys,

62
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:51.080
and streams are distinctly Alaskan.
Eventually,

63
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.440
Russ rose through the air force ranks do master sergeants after holding

64
00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:59.090
positions as a medical records technician and first sergeants of the clinic at

65
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.170
Nielsen Force space,
these positions required him to be in his own words,

66
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.460
tough and mean.
He was the guy who makes you scrub the latrine,

67
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.440
the going who makes you make your bed.

68
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.080
The guy who screams at you for the English to work,

69
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.180
Ross gains a reputation for being hardened.

70
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.360
His subordinates who nicknamed him bust them up.
Bobby.

71
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.620
For anyone who has watched Ross on the dry of painting the image of him as this

72
00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:23.270
authoritarian military figure.

73
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:25.910
It couldn't be further from his television personality.

74
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.740
Apparently Ross yelled so much during his military career he never wanted to

75
00:04:30.741 --> 00:04:33.020
raise his voice again and after he left the Afro

76
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.030
<v 1>right crosses</v>

77
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.980
<v 0>first brush with painting or curves as an asset class of the Anchorage Uso club,</v>

78
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.880
but he clashed with his abstracts of loving instructors.
According to Ross,

79
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.740
they failed to teach him the practical techniques of how to paint the telling

80
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:53.470
you what makes the tree,
but they wouldn't tell you how to paint a tree.

81
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.070
Fortunately,
the experienced and turn him away from painting altogether.

82
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.630
Ross soon found a more suitable painting instructor on public television.
Ross,

83
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:05.260
his predecessor,
was an older German pains and names Bell Alexander.

84
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.070
He hosts today at half hour instructional painting show that magic of oil

85
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.380
painting on a PBS.
Watching the show,

86
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.410
Ross learns how to paint in the other prima style.

87
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.000
This is Italian for fast attempts,
also known in the art world as wet on wet.

88
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.870
Ross perfected the technique which allows him to complete a finished work and

89
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.540
these single session.
Unlike other painting methods,

90
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:27.310
when an artist uses our premed,

91
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.300
he or she can add wet pains in layers without waiting for the paints to fully

92
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:34.470
dry.
Alexander got falsely claims to have invented the starboard.

93
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.450
It actually dates back to the 15th century in Flanders,

94
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.920
which is Modern Day Belgium.

95
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.700
I looked pretty much was popular with many famous artists throughout history,

96
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.200
but enjoyed great fanfare among the impressionist painters in the 19th century.

97
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.860
Notably,
it was a favorite technique of artists,

98
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.300
Claude Monet and John Singer Sargent [inaudible].

99
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.950
After further honing his skills,

100
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.530
Ross decided to supplement his air force pay by selling landscapes painted on

101
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.320
the inside of gold prospecting pans to tourists.

102
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.240
It was a lucrative and ans when his earnings from painting,

103
00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:07.640
so pastors military salary,
he resigned to become a full time artist.

104
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.980
Upon leaving the air force roster tend to Florida and sought out bill Alexander

105
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.350
in order to perfect his painting skills.
By that time,

106
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.980
Alexander taught art classes in his spare time and happily took on the IGA.

107
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.790
Ross Alexander didn't realize that Ross would later take everything he got from

108
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:30.290
these lessons,
make his own show and rise to the level of superstardom he did.

109
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.250
This actually eventually led to the two men falling out during the early

110
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.090
meetings.
Alexander was impressed with Ross.

111
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:40.610
Cindy hired him as a traveling tutor for the Alexander Magic art supplies

112
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:44.990
company.
At the same time,
900 miles away from Alexander's Studio in Clearwater,

113
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.850
Florida.
A woman named Anne Ness.

114
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:51.851
Kowalski was experiencing a debilitating depression after losing her oldest son

115
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.980
and a traffic accidents unable to get up.
She,

116
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.370
they didn't bed all day watching television episodes of the magic of oil

117
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.280
painting desperate and hoping to chair his wife up.

118
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.940
What was it going while ski signed an Asop for a five day pains in class with

119
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.770
Alexander or so she thought before and that's arrival.

120
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.830
Alexandra had passed on his classes to an unknown instructor known simply as
Bob,

121
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.610
and that was incredibly disappointed when she heard Alexander was no longer

122
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:21.560
instructing,
but Walter insisted that she go anyway saying,
get in the car.

123
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.340
We're going.
Over the course of the five day painting class,

124
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.870
whatever misgivings and that fast had about Ross completely disappeared.
In fact,

125
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.770
taking that class,

126
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:35.330
she realized that was something very special about him looking back years later

127
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:37.550
and it said,
I was so mesmerized by Bob.

128
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.890
Somehow he lifted me out of that depression.

129
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.420
I just think that Bob knew how to woo people were willing people.

130
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:48.230
That was kind of Ross's calling cards and that was onto something and she saw in

131
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:51.380
Ross and opportunity to put it in a bottle and sell it.

132
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.620
She believed Ross was capable of making a fortune and she wanted in after the

133
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:57.740
class and Athens,

134
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.610
our husbands took Ross out to dinner and broken a business deal from that point

135
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.450
on and that's became Ross's manager thinking her entire life savings into the

136
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:06.230
partnership.

137
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.070
Ross and his wife ponied up a similar amounts of capital as a manager.

138
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.960
Then at focused on taking out ads in the local papers and setting up painting

139
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.930
seminars and various malls.
She even established a toll free telephone hotline,

140
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.310
1-800-BOB-ROSS.

141
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.270
That's for people to really connect and to experience the Alere of Bob Ross.

142
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.360
She needed to get him in front of as many people as possible.

143
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.350
They filmed to commercial.

144
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.760
Then it's possibly a pilot television show in order to sell it to PBS
executives.

145
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.510
Eventually,

146
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.960
all the hard work and hustle paid off and Ross landed his own show on the

147
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:37.610
network for joy of painting.

148
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.730
The first episode adds on January the 11th 1983 the joy of painting enjoyed an

149
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.280
11 year run on PBS from 1983 to 1994 filming for 103 episodes in total.

150
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.930
During the 30 minutes of our time for each show,
Ross,

151
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:56.760
it stood in a dark room with a blank canvas and it's painted and imaginary

152
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:00.420
landscape scene.
There were two cameras for the program she wants in real time,

153
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.800
a medium shot of Ross and his canvas and take close up shots of the canvas or

154
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:05.580
the Palette.

155
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.330
Ross faithfully instructed oil painting to viewers at home in the other premise

156
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:09.930
style,

157
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.730
the same technique he previously learned from Bill Alexander with there's a more

158
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
than smudges blockages and scrapes from his palace and Ros created masterpieces

159
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.880
to keep the lessons in expensive for people.

160
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.960
The tools and his color selection was limited though he surely had the technique

161
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.920
down.
Ross is real draw for audiences was his calming presence,

162
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.300
slower paced speech,

163
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.930
warm voice and words of encouragement sprinkled in while instructing.

164
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.600
In this way,
Ross is often compared to Fred Rogers,

165
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.690
the iconic children's show host of Mr. RogersRogers' neighborhood.

166
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.910
On the drive painting,
there was no pressure from Ross.

167
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.240
He believed everyone could paint almighty pictures and there are no mistakes or

168
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.550
only happy accidents.

169
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.780
The joy of painting proved to be an immediate success for the PDS network for

170
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:55.620
some of you is it was a reprieve from the harsh realities of life or the

171
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:59.730
doldrums of other television programs.
When asked about his concerning approach,

172
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.780
Ross said,
I got a letter from somebody here a while back and they said,
Bob,

173
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.590
everything in your world seems to be happy.
That's for sure.
That's why I paint.

174
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.550
It's because I can create the kind of world that I want and I can make.

175
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.410
This world is happy as I want.
It shoots.
If you want bad stuff,
watch the news.

176
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.640
The joy of painting was like a personal arts lesson described by his manager,

177
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.860
a nes as liquid tranquilizer.
Yes.
Amazingly,

178
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.340
only about 10% of viewers painted along with Ross,
the other 90% tune den.

179
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:31.770
Do you simply watch him?
Ros worked quickly to create his masterpieces,

180
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.490
swirling the pains around dabbing is here and there and grabbing for his two

181
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:39.270
inch brush every now and then and saying,
now let's get crazy.

182
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.480
He made the whole process of painting look completely effortless.

183
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.740
The truth is that Ross was meticulous and does manage it and that referred to

184
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:50.270
him as a tyrant.
Ross was not mean or nasty according to a nats,

185
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.190
but he was every bit as much a businessman as he wants a painter.

186
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.230
He wants it everything on the show to be perfect and done his way.

187
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.790
Before filming each episode,

188
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:03.660
Ross would lay awake at night planning and rehearsing exactly what he would say.

189
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.400
No one watching whatever.
No.

190
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.840
Ross always appeared to be calm and free form on camera is planning extended to

191
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:12.930
more than the words he said though for each episode of the dry of painting,

192
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.150
Ross didn't complete just one painting.

193
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.590
He always finished three ros pains had one while filming the one everyone saw

194
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.210
and other was done before in Santa,

195
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:24.660
just off camera for roster use as a reference and the final painting.

196
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.890
A more detailed work was completed after the show and was photographed for use

197
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:30.300
in Ross's instruction books.

198
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.630
Ross was never actually paid for appearing in any of the shows on PBS.

199
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.240
Instead he used it to remote is teaching business.

200
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.330
This worked spectacularly and interest in that expanded.

201
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.860
After just the first episode,

202
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.640
the Business Bob Rossing eventually grew to include paint supplies branded by

203
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:48.300
Bob Ross and the company and Ross wrecked in millions of dollars to further

204
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:49.740
bring his brand into the spotlight.

205
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.100
Ross occasionally appeared on talk shows and appeared in promotion or gigs.

206
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.730
Some of these includers MTV,

207
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:58.720
the Joan Rivers show Phil Donahue and as a guest to say Hank Snow Country Music

208
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:00.700
concert.
The final joy of painting show.

209
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.290
And on May the 17th 1994 after Ross was diagnosed with cancer,

210
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.440
Ross's son,
Steven,
who made regular appearances on the show,

211
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.180
apparently with his father on the set,

212
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.320
most of Ross,
his image was intentionally created except for his trademark Afro,

213
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.260
believe it on obs.
His hair wasn't even naturally curly.

214
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.160
It was straight before we officially had made us.
Ross ditched his shorts.

215
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.940
Military crew cuts for a longer style and palm as a way to save money.

216
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.580
Once his sperm was a hallmark of the Bob Ross brands,

217
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.000
he couldn't bring himself to change this,
even though he grew to dislike it.

218
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.550
Later after Ross got sick from lymphoma,
cancer ruins,

219
00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:40.160
lost all his hair to chemotherapy treatments.
He wore a wig on.

220
00:12:40.161 --> 00:12:43.910
It's showed to keep up as a parents Rossi's outfits where another Catholic

221
00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:47.630
crafted elements off his look on the joy of painting Roswell or casual blue

222
00:12:47.631 --> 00:12:50.450
jeans with a button up shirts.
The top buttons were left.

223
00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:52.190
Undones reveal a bit of chest APP.

224
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.660
This timeless look was intended to appear currents.

225
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.040
When PBS add reruns of the show later on,

226
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.770
a private man Rawson does manager and that's told the back story of a life that

227
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:04.880
was light on biographical details.
The story emphasized modest beginnings,

228
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.080
a love of nature and animals,

229
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.220
and it's a philosophy that every person matters is caring personality extended

230
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:14.090
to his view as students and injured animals that he took in and cash for.

231
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.110
This narrative continues to be pushed today by the business.
Bob Ross Inc.

232
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.790
In 1994 raw Swiss dealt a devastating blow with his diagnosis of lymphoma.

233
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.330
A rat died of cancer.
Lymphoma is in a group of blood cancers.

234
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.920
It attacks the lymphatic system.

235
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.400
The lymph nodes and glands along with a network of vessels are an important part

236
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:38.970
of the body.
Circulatory functions that age in a person's immune system.

237
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.230
Many people with lymphoma never have or display symptoms and it isn't known how

238
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.940
much Ross suffered from his disease.

239
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.000
Ross kept his cancer diagnosis out of the public eye.

240
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.310
I need telling his closest friends and relatives.

241
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.300
He apparently painted right up things all the ends and died in 1995 at the age

242
00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:57.660
of 52 that his grave at Woodlands Memorial Park in Florida.

243
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.110
Simple stone market reads Bob Ross television artist

244
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.620
Wilbur Ross was a prolific artist purportedly competing at 30,000 paintings

245
00:14:09.621 --> 00:14:13.010
during his lifetime.
With so many Ross paintings out there in the world,

246
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.850
it would seem relatively easy to find one and bias in order to hang it above the

247
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:20.960
living room couch.
But this is not true anyone wanting to purchase one today,

248
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.180
it would be hard pressed to find an original.

249
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.140
The reason for this is because there are so many copycats and 40 live versions

250
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:28.910
that have flooded the marketplace.
Further,

251
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:32.600
virtually all of Ross's paintings made on the joy of painting had been donated

252
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:37.250
to PBS fundraisers to raise money for other public broadcasting programs.
Today,

253
00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:37.701
the company,

254
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:41.870
Bob Ross Inc is still going strong and is still managed by Annette and Walter

255
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.470
Kowalski.
The company that sells a variety of paints,
brushes,
art kits,
easels,

256
00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:48.620
canvases,
instructional DVDs and books on their website.

257
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.550
One kind of fines and order.
Bob Ross branded apparel,
including socks,

258
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:56.810
t shirts and baby bibs that are an array of accessories and wacky gifts

259
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.590
including coffee mugs,
glasses,
even a certified Bob Ross.

260
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.880
She had passed beyond owns the official merchandise.

261
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:05.840
So I'm going to find just about anything with the Bob Ross image.

262
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.040
A quick Google search even pretends of Brac handle named forceint Bob Ross.

263
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.090
Bob Ross is company.

264
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:14.300
It's still trains and certifies painting instructors who designed to work,

265
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.850
teach and promote themselves in the spirit of the artist.

266
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.660
Most recently Netflix is licensed shows adding Bob Ross's series.

267
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.830
Beauty is everywhere and just the joy of painting to its lineup in pop culture.

268
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.580
References to Bob Ross and his aphorisms everywhere has likened the

269
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.460
inspirational quotes live on through as an ad to memes.

270
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.050
Google celebrated Ross for what would have been his 70th birthday in 2012 with a

271
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:39.950
Google doodle and image of Ross painting the lesser g with a landscape in the

272
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:40.640
background.

273
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.880
He has been mentioned in many popular television shows such as family guy in the

274
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:48.290
boondocks.
Target stores even carry a Bob Ross board game called Bob Ross.

275
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.870
The Art of chill.
If all of this wasn't enough,

276
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:54.920
the Lego company has created a Bob Ross Lego figure completes with a paintbrush

277
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:59.720
and the Palette is icon.
Status today shows absolutely no signs of diminishing.

278
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.070
It seems Ross's legacy isn't ever going to die and just fans will continue to

279
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.130
honor and celebrate the man for years to come.
Ros One said,

280
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.760
didn't you know you had that much power?
You can move mountains,

281
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.570
you can do anything he showed us,
he could create a better place,

282
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.980
a world filled with happy little trees that was free of judgments where everyone

283
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:22.700
was an artist and every landscape was full of majestic wonder.

284
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.540
So I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.
