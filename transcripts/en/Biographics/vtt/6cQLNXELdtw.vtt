13
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>military as a career.</v>

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Obvious three siblings that live to adulthood.</v>

15
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:43.471

19
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.901
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

20
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>he's even been described as frail,</v>

21
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>but he hit his stride and his early teens discovering sports and becoming a</v>

22
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>leader among his peers.</v>

23
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Around this same time,</v>

24
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>he also discovered his love of mathematics and engineering.</v>

25
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>He built his own glider and was known to spend his free time taking apart</v>

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>machinery and putting it back together again,</v>

<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

30
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>but his grades,</v>

31
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>they didn't reflect it without good grades.</v>

32
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Rommel couldn't continue his education at university with his talent for</v>

33
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>machinery.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He considered working at a factory near his childhood home,</v>

35
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>but his father didn't want him working that.</v>

36
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.961
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

37
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>his father pushed grumble into military service.</v>

38
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 18 Rommel began studying it.</v>

44
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>He showed his military talent early on.</v>

45
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.910
<v Speaker 1>He was still a young men and it's no surprise the rumble has more going on in</v>

46
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>his life than just his military service.</v>

47
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Rommel had met a young woman by the name of Walburga stenner while he was posted</v>

48
00:01:59.121 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>in wine.</v>

49

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>You promised that they would marry and live in a house and be a family before</v>

52
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:08.841
<v Speaker 1>they could marry.</v>

53
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Very wild dog gave birth to her daughter that she named to Gertrude.</v>

54
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Months later,</v>

55
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Rommel stationed away from Weingarten sent well bag or a letter the contained</v>

56
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>far different news than what she expected.</v>

57
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>The lesser broke the news that he couldn't marry her.</v>

58
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't from the right class to be an officer's wife and was Korea was his</v>

59
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:26.294
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

60
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Then there was the fact that he was also in love with another woman.</v>

61
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>The other woman was at Lucy Mollin.</v>

62
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.203
<v Speaker 1>She and Matt,</v>

63
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>while he was in cadet school,</v>

64
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>though they did not marry until 1916 rumbles a clear commitment to Lucy did not</v>

65
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>stop Walberg out from loving him,</v>

66
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>though she stayed devoted to him for years,</v>

67
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>believing that as long as he never had children with another woman,</v>

68
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>that was a chance that he would return to her,</v>

69
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>but he never did.</v>

70
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>In 1928 Walburga lands that Lucy was pregnant with Rommel's trials,</v>

71
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.110
<v Speaker 1>unable to deal with the news.</v>

72
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.130
<v Speaker 1>She killed herself.</v>

73
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Rommel and Lucy were supportive of Gertrude both financially and emotionally.</v>

74
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>They welcome time into their home.</v>

75
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>They did introduce her as their niece when Lawler was fighting in Africa.</v>

76
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>The scarf that he wore was knitted for him by Gertrude Rommel and Lucy's own</v>

77
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:08.561
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>

78
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:08.821
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

79
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Fred was born in 1928 and even went on to become mayor of Stuttgart for 20</v>

80
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.194
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

81
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.850
<v Speaker 1>That's almost family life was taking shape,</v>

82
00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>so was his military career months after his illegitimate daughter was born in</v>

85
00:03:25.221 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>began his war service as a platoon commander in Verdun where he soon established</v>

86
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the fearlessness that he became known for only a month into the war.</v>

87
00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:35.330
<v Speaker 1>He'd charge degree for French soldiers with a banner ads on his own.</v>

88
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>He had no ammunition but the French troops did rumble.</v>

89
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It was shot in the leg,</v>

90
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>but this was only to be the first of many injuries that he sustained during his</v>

91
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 1>military service.</v>

92
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Rommel was so well known for charging.</v>

93
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>It had an ending up in the thick of this,</v>

94
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 1>this his trips used to see where Rommel is there as the front [inaudible] served</v>

95
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:52.431
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>

96
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:52.821
<v Speaker 1>Romania,</v>

97
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:54.290
<v Speaker 1>and SLE during World War One.</v>

98
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.570
<v Speaker 1>He was not only respected for his courage,</v>

99
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 1>for his leadership and implementing new strategies and maneuvers for warfare.</v>

100
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 1>One of rumbles,</v>

101
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.570
<v Speaker 1>most exceptional victories came as he led troops in the mountainous region of</v>

102
00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Kappa rata in Italy.</v>

103
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Rommel streets where polyphasic conditions were horrific,</v>

104
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.560
<v Speaker 1>but with the use of new infiltration tactics.</v>

105
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.670
<v Speaker 1>The German Nan Austro-hungarian troops had a decisive victory over the Italian</v>

106
00:04:16.671 --> 00:04:17.330
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

107
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.470
<v Speaker 1>9,000 Italian men were captured 150 of them offices,</v>

108
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Rommel.</v>

109
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It didn't achieve this by following orders.</v>

110
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.201
<v Speaker 1>It's quite the contrary.</v>

111
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:24.830
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

112
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 1>when he was told to stand down,</v>

113
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.860
<v Speaker 1>he moved forward and attacked.</v>

114
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>He also used a strategy you have coming out the attacks from surprising</v>

115
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>directions and creating confusion and disorder among the Italian trips for his</v>

116
00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Speaker 1>role in the battle,</v>

117
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Rommel received the Paul and Mary.</v>

118
00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a prestigious German Order of merit.</v>

119
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Even before his achievements of the Battle of Cup Hereso Rommel has earns the</v>

120
00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:48.050
<v Speaker 1>iron cross and had been promoted to first lieutenant.</v>

121
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>In 1918 he received another promotion to captain when World War One ended.</v>

122
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Rommel stayed in the military,</v>

123
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>leaving the 30th infantry regiment and still got most of the work involved</v>

124
00:04:58.461 --> 00:04:59.780
<v Speaker 1>dealing with civil unrest,</v>

125
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but Rommel didn't use the same aggressive tactics he was known for in the</v>

126
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.770
<v Speaker 1>battlefields.</v>

127
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.320
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

128
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>the avoided using force as much as he could and negotiations took the place of</v>

129
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 1>action in the town of Lindau rather than attack the communists,</v>

130
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.590
<v Speaker 1>he was staging an uprising and the town rumble used to diplomacy to get the</v>

131
00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 1>cities governments back under control recognized for his leadership</v>

132
00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:20.031
<v Speaker 1>capabilities.</v>

133
00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Rommel was sooner pointed to two teeth Shanthi Dresden infantry school.</v>

134
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Among the advice a Lawford future military leaders is this advice that he</v>

135
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>followed in his own military career.</v>

136
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Be an example to your men and your duty hand in your private life.</v>

137
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Never spare yourself and let the troops see that you don't in your endurance and</v>

138
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>fatigue and privation.</v>

139
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Always be tactful and well mannered and teach your subordinates to do the same.</v>

140
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Avoid excessive sharpness or harshness of voice,</v>

141
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.580
<v Speaker 1>which usually indicates the man who has shortcomings of his own to hide during</v>

142
00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 1>this time at Rommel also said to work putting his military strategies on paper.</v>

143
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.110
<v Speaker 1>In 1934 Rommel Oseberg on infantry training was published.</v>

144
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>He was no longer teaching having left that role in 1933 but he was leading</v>

145
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>troops in gossip.</v>

146
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It was in Gossler that he encountered at off it and for the first time Hitler</v>

147
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>was chancellor and he was in Gosselaar to inspect troops.</v>

148
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>By 1937 Hitler was well aware of Ronald Man,</v>

149
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:12.434
<v Speaker 1>his reputation.</v>

150
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.393
<v Speaker 1>He names Rommel,</v>

151
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>the war ministry liaison for the Hitler youth,</v>

152
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but Rommel was not a member of the Nazi party.</v>

153
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>He ends another hit.</v>

154
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>The youth leader disagreed about tactics and organization for the group and in</v>

155
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:23.451
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

156
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>rumble lost his role in 1938 even though Rommel wasn't a member of the Nazi</v>

157
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

158
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>he was still a supporter of Hitler during his rise to power.</v>

159
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>He did agree with Hitler's efforts to re militarize and do unify Germany and</v>

160
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Hitler still wanted Rommel in the upper echelons of the military.</v>

161
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.051
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

162
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>he made a direct request that rubble will be part of the units that traveled</v>

163
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:43.060
<v Speaker 1>with Hitler.</v>

164
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>The assignment not only gave Rommel access to the fear,</v>

165
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>but it also gave him more free time for his hobbies and interests than he had</v>

166
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>ever had before.</v>

167
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>He wants again,</v>

168
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>started focusing on math and engineering and even took time away to go skiing,</v>

169
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but this wasn't a loss because war,</v>

170
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>it was just around the corner.</v>

171
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>1939 was a watershed year for Europe and it's the wells under Hitler's orders.</v>

172
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Germany invaded Poland on September the first 1939 as part of the preparation</v>

173
00:07:13.201 --> 00:07:14.011
<v Speaker 1>for the invasion,</v>

174
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Rommel had been promoted to major general and was entrusted with protecting</v>

175
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Hitler as war erupts says.</v>

176
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1940 Ronald was put in charge of the seventh Panzer Division,</v>

177
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.920
<v Speaker 1>the Panzer divisions made up of armored tanks.</v>

178
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>an ideal opportunity for rumble to put his particular strategic skill set on</v>

180
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.810
<v Speaker 1>display.</v>

181
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Initially plans were for rum olds who heads up a mountain division first.</v>

182
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.840
<v Speaker 1>With the support Rommel was able to land at the head of the division.</v>

183
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>He wants it in addition to armored tanks.</v>

184
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Rommel was also leading rifle regiments,</v>

185
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 1>a motorcycle battalion as an engineer.</v>

186
00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:44.560
<v Speaker 1>The Talia,</v>

187
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Andy was doing this out of the usual order of military protocol when Hitler made</v>

188
00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Romola General.</v>

189
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.680
<v Speaker 1>He bypassed other more experienced military men to do so.</v>

190
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.680
<v Speaker 1>This started some grumblings within the German military,</v>

191
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.860
<v Speaker 1>but Rommel assume proved himself to be worthy off the rank.</v>

192
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 1>He puts his division through their training pieces for months and in May they</v>

193
00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:04.290
<v Speaker 1>sat off for battle and France.</v>

194
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:04.951
<v Speaker 1>The battle,</v>

195
00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it didn't start out well for ramen and an air strips.</v>

196
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Bridges were out where they needed to cross a river and it's the French were</v>

197
00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:11.011
<v Speaker 1>firing,</v>

198
00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>stopping the German troops from making attempts to cross,</v>

199
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 1>but Rommel outsmarted them.</v>

200
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.050
<v Speaker 1>He's our building's on fire creating a wall of smoke that gave it strips the</v>

201
00:08:19.051 --> 00:08:22.500
<v Speaker 1>cover they needed as they fired her back across the river at the French.</v>

202
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.890
<v Speaker 1>They then got in rubber boots and made their way across the water using</v>

203
00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:27.750
<v Speaker 1>materials from another panzer division.</v>

204
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 1>They built a bridge and the full division moved across Rommel.</v>

205
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.300
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't standing back and giving orders.</v>

206
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:33.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

207
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.710
<v Speaker 1>The general was actually in the thick of the action firing a machine gun and</v>

208
00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:40.320
<v Speaker 1>even wading into the water to put the bridge together.</v>

209
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

210
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Ramos Division made quick progress.</v>

211
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Within days they captured 10,000 French soldiers and only lost three doesn't</v>

212
00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:48.384
<v Speaker 1>have their own men.</v>

213
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.433
<v Speaker 1>For this victory,</v>

214
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Rommel was awarded the Knight's cross.</v>

215
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.381
<v Speaker 1>In the coming weeks.</v>

216
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Rommel continues has advanced across France.</v>

217
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>He announced success is to had learned a telegram containing only four words.</v>

218
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the coast.</v>

219
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the seventh panzer divisions move across France.</v>

220
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Rumble moved his trips so quickly in surreptitiously that even the German high</v>

221
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>command couldn't keep track of them.</v>

222
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>This led them to debates the ghost division off to the gentleman's march through</v>

223
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:13.681
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

224
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>the stories a Roosevelt,</v>

225
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.421
<v Speaker 1>Rommel shooting,</v>

226
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>an unarmed French prison off and not following orders.</v>

227
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>He's also been accused of involvement in the massacre of French African soldiers</v>

228
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>from Senegal and men under his command were involved in the killing of dozens of</v>

229
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>men who are surrendering and therefore posed no threat to the German soldiers.</v>

230
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>While some of his troops were very likely involved in such a trustee's,</v>

231
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 1>historians believe rumble would not have given commands for such brutal attacks.</v>

232
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>According to historian Rafael Shack,</v>

233
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>although there is no evidence incriminating,</v>

234
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Rama themself is unit did find in areas where German massacres of black French</v>

235
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>prisoners of war were extremely common.</v>

236
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>In June,</v>

237
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>1940 after the gym Taiko for France,</v>

238
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>the plan it was at first for Ronald's to had to Britain.</v>

239
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>That would be the next nation the Germany would take over.</v>

240
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>But it was decided that the German air force wasn't strong enough to do what</v>

241
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 1>needed to be done in order to take over England's and instead Rommel was sent to</v>

242
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:04.344
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

243
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>The Afrika Korps was a newly created division of the German military and General</v>

244
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Rummel was the man who led it to victories.</v>

245
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 1>The Italians had been suffering crushing losses in northern Africa and Hitler</v>

246
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>wanted the Germans there to beat back.</v>

247
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 1>The British royal arrived in the in 1941 and he was supposed to answer to the</v>

248
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Italian commanding military officer,</v>

249
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but he disagreed with the Italians tactics.</v>

250
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>They wanted the Italian and German troops to use a defensive strategy.</v>

251
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Rommel wanted to advance and take on with the British directly.</v>

252
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Hedler agreed with Rommel man's Rommel began planning an offensive.</v>

253
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.031
<v Speaker 1>The British,</v>

254
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

255
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.010
<v Speaker 1>had no idea that was the plan.</v>

256
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>The only intelligence was the rumbles orders,</v>

257
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 1>where to stay put.</v>

258
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.590
<v Speaker 1>When Romo moved districts forward,</v>

259
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.860
<v Speaker 1>they were caught a well off guard,</v>

260
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>rumbles slimer nuvaring.</v>

261
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>It's proved fruitful for him once again,</v>

262
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 1>but even with success,</v>

263
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the Italian lead a Garibaldi was not happy.</v>

264
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.151
<v Speaker 1>Rommel,</v>

265
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 1>her disobeyed orders and then matter the outcome.</v>

266
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>That was not the way the military was supposed to work.</v>

267
00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.380
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

268
00:10:59.380 --> 00:10:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Rommel,</v>

269
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>he had a response for Garibaldi value.</v>

270
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.401
<v Speaker 1>One can often,</v>

271
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:06.180
<v Speaker 1>they're two unique opportunities to sit by for the sake of trifles outside of</v>

272
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

273
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Rummel was capturing the attention of world leaders.</v>

274
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill was 90 water.</v>

275
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 1>What else matters?</v>

276
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 1>But beating him,</v>

277
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.470
<v Speaker 1>but the nickname he owns it.</v>

278
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 1>His clandestine maneuverings in Africa is what a stuck through the decades of</v>

279
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

280
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>and I would be the Desert Fox,</v>

281
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>but its successes.</v>

282
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 1>They came to an ends.</v>

283
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.220
<v Speaker 1>The British recaptured,</v>

284
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the city of Tobruk and rumbles games had been lost.</v>

285
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Then rumble was part of a crucial meeting with Hitler Ins and other German</v>

286
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:31.960
<v Speaker 1>military leader elders,</v>

287
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Castle ring,</v>

288
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 1>the two field marshals.</v>

289
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 1>They disagreed and how the Germans should move forward.</v>

290
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Initially they presented their arguments and Hitler agreed with castle ring.</v>

291
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Gasser ring took over and Rommel was moved to do need the troops on the coast of</v>

292
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

293
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 1>By the time Romo was reassigned to France,</v>

294
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>he was starting to be more and more skeptical of Hitler.</v>

295
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>His strategies and his goals are almost,</v>

296
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>didn't support the brutal actions,</v>

297
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the SS,</v>

298
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 1>and eventually you came to believe that Germany would be better off negotiating</v>

299
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 1>an end to the war instead of continuing the carnage and all the death,</v>

300
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't alone in his beliefs.</v>

301
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>A group of men who agreed with Rommel,</v>

302
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>even suggested that he should become Geminis new leader.</v>

303
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Though Rommel didn't act on that suggestion,</v>

304
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the mere fact of the suggestion ultimately helped seal rumbles face from the</v>

305
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>time he was in charge of coastal forces.</v>

306
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>In 1943 Rommel spent his time and strategy building up coastal defenses.</v>

307
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.710
<v Speaker 1>He says mine's built barbed wire obstructions and even had troops flood areas of</v>

308
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 1>the coast to make it harder for trips to pass.</v>

309
00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Three he also wanted to bring more tanks closer to the coast,</v>

310
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.270
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

311
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 1>No one else agreed with them that that was necessary.</v>

312
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.250
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of 1944 it would turn out to there's Rommel,</v>

313
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

314
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 1>he was riced wants to move more tanks to the coast.</v>

315
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Speaker 1>On June the fifth 1944 Rummel left France.</v>

316
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>He headed home to Germany so that he could be with his wife on her birthday.</v>

317
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Speaker 1>June the sixth when he left France,</v>

318
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.520
<v Speaker 1>he and the rest of the German military thought the weather would be bad and they</v>

319
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to worry about any allied movements on the coast and they also</v>

320
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>thought that if any trouble was to come,</v>

321
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:57.670
<v Speaker 1>it would be a Kelly,</v>

322
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 1>but the allies had used the German military is weak intelligence system to get</v>

323
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 1>them to think that the attack would come at Cali.</v>

324
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 1>While he was a time celebrating his wife's birthday,</v>

325
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Rommel received a phone call that shocked him.</v>

326
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>The allies had landed at Normandy on June the SEC.</v>

327
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 1>The weather had cleared and the trips were storming.</v>

328
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 1>The beaches rumbled left Germany immediately to hand to the front.</v>

329
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>He and other leaders establish to counter attack plan,</v>

330
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.610
<v Speaker 1>but I live fire was too strong and needed troops when table to arrive.</v>

331
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Rommel himself was injured badly by allied air strikes and the ends 155,000</v>

332
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.360
<v Speaker 1>allied troops landed during the d day invasion growing to 1 million after the</v>

333
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.194
<v Speaker 1>initial push,</v>

334
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>the fourth stormed through German defenses during the summer of 1944 it's a</v>

335
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 1>rumble.</v>

336
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that jam and he couldn't overcome the losses and so you continued</v>

337
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 1>forward march of the allies.</v>

338
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 1>He broke the news of his assessment to hit not telling him the tape political</v>

339
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 1>solution was likely the best way forward.</v>

340
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:53.734
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

341
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.250
<v Speaker 1>the fear,</v>

342
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 1>though he did not agree this meeting would ultimately be the lost between the</v>

343
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>two men as victory for Germany was looking less and less likely,</v>

344
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 1>opposition to Hitler was growing in Germany.</v>

345
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>High ranking military officials,</v>

346
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 1>including those close to Rommel where it's starting to make plans to get rid of</v>

347
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 1>the Fiera assassination was among the many options they contemplated.</v>

348
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Knowing Rommel disagreed with Hitler.</v>

349
00:14:14.001 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Runs was growing increasingly upset with the fear of the men plotting to</v>

350
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:17.561
<v Speaker 1>overthrow.</v>

351
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Hitler tried to bring him into the fault.</v>

352
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

353
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.921
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear ref.</v>

354
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Rommel was actually involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler on us,</v>

355
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and if he was,</v>

356
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.890
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear just how much he knew.</v>

357
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 1>His widow later said,</v>

358
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Rommel only wanted Hitler to be brought to court and it's nothing more.</v>

359
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're a though he fought to,</v>

360
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:33.701
<v Speaker 1>there's a rumble,</v>

361
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>wanted him dead and in the end that's what matters.</v>

362
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm July 20th,</v>

363
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.800
<v Speaker 1>1944 a group of conspirators smuggled a bomb inside the briefcase into a meeting</v>

364
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 1>at Hitler's headquarters that was supposed to be two bombs,</v>

365
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 1>but there was only time to prepare one and two when it exploded.</v>

366
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 1>The survived instead of a successful key with the conspirators found themselves</v>

367
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>facing treason charges and the death penalty and Rommel was among those</v>

368
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:55.754
<v Speaker 1>indicators.</v>

369
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>In October,</v>

370
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 1>1944 two or fitness generals confronted rumble as ss troops surrounded the area.</v>

371
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>The generals told Rommel that he had three options and you could go to speak to</v>

372
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Hitler directly and explain himself and he could go to court or he could commit</v>

373
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>suicide there.</v>

374
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:13.710
<v Speaker 1>And then Rommel,</v>

375
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Molly opted for suicide in his final communication with his wife.</v>

376
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>He explains why in view of my services in Africa,</v>

377
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I have the chance of dying by poison.</v>

378
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Two generals have brought it with them.</v>

379
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>It is fatal in three seconds.</v>

380
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 1>If I take the poison,</v>

381
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>none of the usual steps will be taken against my family.</v>

382
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 1>That is against you.</v>

383
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 1>They will also leave my staff alone.</v>

384
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Having explained to his family what was to happen,</v>

385
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Ron more got into an ss car.</v>

386
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 1>He took the Sinai Capsi,</v>

387
00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>all that Hitler's general had brought and he died.</v>

388
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 1>He was wearing his Africa corps jacket and carrying his field marshal's baton.</v>

389
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>The world was told he died of wounds he had sustained from allied air attacks in</v>

390
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 1>the wake of d day,</v>

391
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.150
<v Speaker 1>and he was buried with full military honors only after the war did the truth</v>

392
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:53.960
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

393
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Rommel was not maps with the same disdain from world leaders.</v>

394
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:59.060
<v Speaker 1>There's other Germans were in the wake of World War II.</v>

395
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Even Winston Churchill spoke highly of him.</v>

396
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>He also deserves our respect because although a loyal German soldier,</v>

397
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 1>he came to hate him and all his works and took part in the conspiracy to rescue</v>

398
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Germany by displacing the maniac and tyrants for this,</v>

399
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you paid the forfeit of his life,</v>

400
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:15.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

401
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.970
<v Speaker 1>when Rommel was a talented leader,</v>

402
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.200
<v Speaker 1>but his military duty survey regime that had terrible intentions and committed</v>

403
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 1>horrific atrocities were almost life and death were intertwines with a watershed</v>

404
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 1>era in human history.</v>

405
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 1>An era upon which he left his mark.</v>
