1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.080
Auto was the 27 16 to 45 the small town of berries and Edmonds.

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:09.081
England's set a grizzly record that day 18 men and women were hangs together as

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:09.780
witches.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
There was the single biggest mass execution for witchcraft in English history

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.670
and it was all the work of one man.
Matthew Hopkins was many things.

6
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.670
It's having owner,
a former lawyer,
the dedicated puritan,

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.470
but to the people of various and Edmonds.

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.540
He had only one title worth knowing and that was which find a general.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.440
The son of a minister,

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.910
Hopkins began applying as gruesome trade in 1645 at the height of the first

11
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.570
English civil war together with as associate John,

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.960
he was personally responsible for the torture and execution of more women than

13
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.950
every single English which find in the previous century,
but Hopkins,

14
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.710
his tail is more than just a catalog of atrocity.

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.840
It's a tale of what can happen when an entire nation to comes to fear and mass

16
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:52.920
hysteria.
Today,

17
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:57.540
we're going to examine how one zealous man managed to corrupt England's sole

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.320
when Matthew Hopkins was born in when I'm Suffolk,

19
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:17.090
probably in 1620 it was into a world that was alive with superstition.

20
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.860
A king was on the throne,
King James the first.
He didn't just believe in witches,

21
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.320
but had literally written the book on them called demonology,

22
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.450
Britain's fastest growing religious movement.

23
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:30.800
Puritanism took it for granted that Satan himself walks to the byways and the

24
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.020
country lanes of England's Hopkins.

25
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:37.250
This meant a childhood that was practically drowning and superstition is father

26
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:42.251
John was a puritan minister who preached fire and Brimstone as was his uncle and

27
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.340
his one of his brothers.

28
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.060
It's likely they even had a copy of demonology lying around the house.

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.140
We say likely here because there's a lot we actually don't know about Matthew

30
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.070
Hopkins.
His early life,

31
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.700
while centuries of legends claimed that he did this all that the historical

32
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.210
record is actually pretty sparse.
Take his education.

33
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.390
There's some evidence that he may have gone to Holland to finish his schooling

34
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.360
just as the some evidence.
He may have trained as a lawyer,

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.630
but we're going to be honest with you and simply say that we just don't know.

36
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.390
Maybe all of that is true,
but maybe none of it is.

37
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.130
What is true is that is harder passed away at some point.

38
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:19.131
It's likely around 1635 come 1614 Matthew moved 10 miles down the road to

39
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.320
manningtree in Essex,
local law hazard that he purchased the Thorn in,

40
00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:27.020
in nearby mislead,
but really that's just another gas,

41
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.960
but it's here that the guesswork finally ends.

42
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.370
We know that Hopkins was in manning tree by the end of 1640 we also know that he

43
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:36.260
was around in 19 or 20 years old,

44
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.550
and that's important because 1640 was the year that the peaceful England of

45
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.600
Hopkins is.
Youth finally fractured into a billion jagged pieces.

46
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.420
It was time for the first English civil war.

47
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.520
If you've watched our video on Oliver Cromwell and modesty aside,

48
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:59.410
it does make a useful crib sheet for this entire period.

49
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.940
You'll know that 1640 ended with a Scottish army occupying the north of England

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.600
and King Charles the first to being forced to call the new parliaments to raise

51
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.380
taxes.
Okay.
Now the INS and outs of this don't really matter for today's story,

52
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.200
but the upshot is that this led to something called the long parliament,

53
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.190
which led to some of the gold,

54
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:20.110
the grounds remonstrance switch in 1642 led to Charles' deciding to crush

55
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.390
parliaments in a war.
And look,

56
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.530
I know we're really missing out a lot of stuff here.

57
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:26.710
Don't have too much of a go at me in the comments.

58
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:30.430
This is really just a super condensed timeline in order to give you just some

59
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:31.990
background information.
Now,

60
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:36.160
the wall was really housing England as civil wars tend to be local courts were

61
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:40.570
suspended in many regions and law and order.
It kind of broke down into usable.

62
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.170
This came famine,
fuel shortages and biting poverty.

63
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.810
Places like the eastern England's where Hopkins lived,

64
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:51.070
where particularly hard hit much of the east with staunchly Puritan and pro

65
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:51.610
parliament,

66
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.710
which was a huge problem when nearby Oxford was the base of the king's NTP and

67
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.170
army.
To use a crude analogy,

68
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.210
living in Essex during the dog days of the war would have been like living in

69
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:06.100
Poland shortly after Annex Czechoslovakia.
You know,
the hammer is going to fall.

70
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.130
You just don't know when ends that waiting could send men mavs men like Sir

71
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.540
Hospital grimstone that can 1640 the livestock on.
So grins,

72
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.950
Don's vast estate and estate that included Hopkins.

73
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:22.860
His new home had begun to be plagued by mysterious illnesses as the ongoing wild

74
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.770
west and the situation the local peasantry turned to superstition in order to do

75
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:28.300
explain things before long,

76
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.180
they were certain that it has to be the work of a witch.

77
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.260
And in 1645 they finally identify top.

78
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.530
Elizabeth Clark was an elderly widow living on so grim lands them on Shay Lynch

79
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.130
mob.
A villages presented her to sa Grimson as the source of all his woes,

80
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.050
like the good Christian.
He was.

81
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.620
So Grinstein recommended Elizabeth Clark for trial.

82
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.281
All right,

83
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:00.880
so at this point we do need to take a quickly back in time because I want to

84
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.390
give you some background information on which trials in England's because a,

85
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.550
it's super interesting and B,

86
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.110
because it will help you understand how terrifyingly unique Hopkins was prior to

87
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.100
the era we're talking about,

88
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:15.640
which ones haven't really been a thing in England's been the medieval period,

89
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:19.390
which is actually seen as healers and pillars of their communities.

90
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.880
It wasn't until 1563 I'm sorry,
Elizabeth.

91
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.660
The first that the bill against conjugation ends witchcraft and sorcery and

92
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:30.130
enchantments made witchcraft illegal.
Even then it was barely illegal eagle,

93
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.740
the first major,
which trial in 1566 pounds.

94
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:37.120
All three defendants guilty and sentence them to just a single year in prison.

95
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.770
That's right.
No torture,
no burning at the stake,
just 12 months in the neck.

96
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.730
Now we need to be clear that English women were executed for witchcraft in this

97
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.840
period.
Unlike on the consonant,
though their deaths were closer to lynchings.

98
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.170
Local magistrates would get caught up in a panic and sign the death warrants.

99
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:55.420
I need to be later punished by their superiors.

100
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.870
For the incredulous fools executions weren't government policy and less the

101
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.160
which was using how supposed powers to commit other capital crimes like murder.

102
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.491
Now,

103
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:09.110
that all changed when James the first ascended to the throne on March the 24th

104
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:13.910
at 1603 Elizabeth first to breathed her last in the chili rooms of Richmond

105
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.850
palace badly was she called before,
has success of James.

106
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:20.330
The first was ramming anti,
which legislation through parliaments.

107
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.950
James the first was obsessed with witchcraft in 1589 had been on a boat that

108
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.730
nearly sank in a storm that was blamed on witches and the experience sent him

109
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:29.690
just the little cookies.

110
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.120
In 1597 he published demonology the which finding book that James Hopkins had

111
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.720
kept lying around Matthew's childhood home in 1604 James.

112
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.630
The first terms of this personal obsession into legal reality,

113
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.410
parliament passed the witchcraft statute which made the very active using

114
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:48.710
witchcraft rather than the spells affects a capital offense.

115
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.590
If that sounds like splitting has the results suggest otherwise.

116
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.880
Eight years after the bill passed,
10 women were hanged in Pencil.
For witchcraft.

117
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.880
Four years later,
another nine was sent to the gallows and less stuck.

118
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.130
By the time you get to Elizabeth Clark's trial in 1645 which stalls had become a

119
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.370
fact of life in England,

120
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.030
the only remarkable thing about them was how comparatively restrains they were.

121
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.950
I remember this was the era of the worst Berg,

122
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:14.870
which draws went up to 600 witches were burned alive in Germany against such

123
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.310
mass slaughter nine or 10 being hanged was pretty mild.
Unfortunately though,

124
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.960
things wouldn't be modeled for much longer.

125
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.760
Back in Mannington 1645 and Matthew Hopkins had gotten wind of and bending

126
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.050
trial.
For whatever reason,

127
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.110
something about this news lit a fire in his solve burns like the fires of hell.

128
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.820
Despite having no training and no legal standing,

129
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:38.810
Hopkins decided it was his duty to get involved with Clark's prosecution.

130
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.810
It was a decision that would very soon lead to the bloodiest,

131
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:43.730
which panic in English history.

132
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.823
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

133
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.850
<v 0>In is 1647 Berg.
The discovery of witches,</v>

134
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.530
Matthew Hopkins would claim is which one's in career began in 1644 however,

135
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:02.531
all evidence suggests it was here with Elizabeth Clark in March of 1645 that he

136
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:06.890
really got into which finding no one is sure of the exact timeline,

137
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.500
but it seems the Hopkins was approached by a man 10 years.

138
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:13.310
His senior names John Stern,
originally from Lowe's in Suffolk.

139
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.740
How exactly they got talking is unknown,

140
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.200
but it's student transpired that stern shed.

141
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:20.900
Hopkins is sharply defined view of good and evil.

142
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.230
Together they agreed to make clock confess to our sins.

143
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.840
At this point in English history torture.

144
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.270
It was illegal to it as it's a confession suspected,

145
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:33.260
which is would be monitored by watches to see if they summoned any familiars or

146
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.280
started zooming around on broomsticks or something like of that.

147
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.210
Clock had been watched for several days now and so far nothing had happened.

148
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.470
That wasn't until Hopkins and stone showed up despite having no legal authority

149
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:46.160
to do so.

150
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.910
Hopkins and stone convinced the watchers to turn Clark's interrogation over to

151
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:54.050
them.
They took her to the born in and what happens next is shrouded in mystery.

152
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.690
Hopkins would laser claimed that they witnessed car call her familiars amps in

153
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:59.160
the animal form to the end,

154
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.760
including a demonic bunny rabbit named just sugar and friends.
No,

155
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:06.750
we're not making this up.
More likely,
Hopkins and Stan,

156
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.670
they tortured the poor old women.
Either way,

157
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:12.750
the result was the same cock confess to being a witch and she started naming

158
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.890
other witches as well.

159
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.610
Armed with these new names done in Hopkins approach the out of Hardwick who was

160
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:20.970
presiding over clocks trial impressed by the young men's initiative,

161
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.350
Holloway gave stunned and official warrants to find more witches in Mannington

162
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.670
Hopkins.
He was made as a systems.

163
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.640
It wouldn't be long before their roles were reversed.
Though.

164
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.030
Over the next few weeks,
Hopkins and Stan conducted their inquiries.

165
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.310
The five women named by Clark were all taken in and interrogated and Zillow Vitu

166
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.160
confessed and gave up more names.
Within no time,

167
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:41.610
it's all the witch finders of jails.

168
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:46.611
23 women and Mannington was in the grip of a full blown which panic pure in and

169
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.620
Nahum Maya Wellington recorded the whole thing,

170
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:53.910
including the lurid testimony of Rebecca West who'd been jailed by Hopkins

171
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:55.960
alongside her mother Ran West plains,

172
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.410
that she had been forced to have sex with the devil and that Oni am mother's

173
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.680
death could save half from Satan's spell.

174
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.940
The jury obliged by having an hanged.
By the end of the Essex trials,

175
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.590
18 women had been hanged,

176
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:11.220
including Elizabeth clock further for more had died in jail.

177
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.360
I knew Rebecca West Dude sacrificed her own mother was finally set free.

178
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.120
It was the deadliest which panic to of Efa hit England's,

179
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.430
even if Hopkins and Stern had never tried another,

180
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.530
which the Essex trials would still be famous boy into by his success in manning

181
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:24.841
tree,

182
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.830
perhaps enjoying the new found celebrity Hopkins bestowed upon himself the title

183
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.530
of which find general oms with Hardwick Suarez.

184
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.460
Ian's done headed east following in the wake of the shocking news of Clark's

185
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:36.294
execution.

186
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.260
It was this news that became the spark that would turn the east of England's

187
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.730
into an inferno.

188
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.490
And December,
1643 the provost marshal of the parliamentarian,

189
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.630
Eastern Association,

190
00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:57.500
conditioned William Dousing to destroy all non puritan icons in Suffolk dousing

191
00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.970
took to the job like an extremist Dr Water Way.

192
00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:04.960
In 1645 he rampage across the east burning churches,

193
00:11:04.961 --> 00:11:08.510
vandalizing icons and encouraging puritan extremism.

194
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.880
Eventually dousing zealotry got so frightening that Oliver Cromwell personally

195
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:16.060
stripped him of his commission.
By then the damage it was done,

196
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.380
dozens of towns across Suffolk had been reduced to rex that populations either

197
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.500
cowed or swept up and religious fervor.

198
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.000
It was these people who two years later would call upon the which find a general

199
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.870
as they left behind the debt of manningtree tree ans ventured into Suffolk in

200
00:11:31.871 --> 00:11:36.490
1645 Hopkins and Stan charted a course that took them to many of the towns

201
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:38.560
dowsing had previously swept through.

202
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.320
It's a move it straight from the modern extremist playbook.

203
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.860
Identify a person or community already damaged by extremism,

204
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:49.270
like dowsing smashing of icons and push them even further into madness.

205
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.120
Just as isis did on the water and plans of Iraq.

206
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.990
Hopkins and Susan found an audience in dancing's ruined villages.
The pads,

207
00:11:56.991 --> 00:12:00.340
the modus operandi,
it was simple as they traveled the witch finders,

208
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:02.830
which led to villages know that they were in the area.

209
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.360
The villagers responded by inviting the men.
Yup.

210
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.460
They really did invite them like a pair of misogynistic vampires.

211
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.530
Hopkins and Stan never ends it.
A victim's home without an invite.

212
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.581
In normal times,

213
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:16.540
this would have ensured that crackpot adventure and did as soon as it had began

214
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.140
about,
well,
these were no more times.
People were afraid,

215
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.150
afraid that the king's army would kill them,

216
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.530
that that children would staff and that they would freeze to death in the winds

217
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:27.820
up in another historical contacts,
not,
yeah,

218
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:31.510
it might have been timed on Jews or illegal immigrants or bending of the

219
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.410
outsider group.
In England's of 1645 it was turned on.

220
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:39.760
Women once invited into a village,
Hopkins and Stan sent to work on suspected,

221
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:43.170
which is unlike the thumbscrew happy sadists in Europe,
Hopkins,

222
00:12:43.171 --> 00:12:47.650
his interrogation methods wouldn't sort of looks out of place in a CIA handbook.

223
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.180
Victims were made to sit absolutely still without sleep for days on end.

224
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.930
Others were logged in isolation and denied food or anything but water.

225
00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.520
The others were made to exercise for hours and hours every day until they were

226
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:04.420
ready to drop at the ends of all this psychological torture,
the accused,

227
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.780
they nearly always confessed.
Hopkins then forced them to name more,

228
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:11.890
which is in the village who would intend confess and so on and so forth.

229
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.980
That's not to say that the stories you've heard about Hopkins aren't true.

230
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.730
He really did test if some women were witches buying,

231
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:20.770
tying them up and throwing them into rivers,
those that drowns.

232
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.230
They were innocent and there's that.

233
00:13:22.231 --> 00:13:26.170
Fluted has magic powers and they were executed for all this bloodshed,

234
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.130
Hopkins and Stan,

235
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:31.420
and anywhere between six pounds and 23 pounds per village at the high ends.

236
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:36.421
That's roughly equivalent to 5,000 pounds or $6,500 today it said the Hopkins

237
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:40.960
made a thousand pounds during his career as a witch finder at a time when the

238
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:45.250
average labor is wage was a mere six pence per day death.

239
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.520
In short,
it made Matthew Hopkins filthy rich.

240
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.430
Not The hands done actually hung around for the death boss.
That confessional.

241
00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:56.050
Let's do the witch finder general and his assistant would vanish into the night,

242
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.190
leaving the accused to their fates and what fates.
These were.

243
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.020
In August of 1645 and 80 year old minister called John Loughs was forced to run

244
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:08.080
on the spot without sleep until he collapsed from exhaustion.

245
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.640
On the 27th of the month,

246
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.750
18 women and men were hanged together outside berries and Edmonds,

247
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.660
the West mass execution of any English,
which scat and yet that's right.

248
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.301
Men were killed,

249
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:21.370
just which is to Hopkins was responsible for the execution of between 17 and 20

250
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.990
men for witchcraft during his career,

251
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.650
including three husbands who were killed alongside their wives.

252
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.880
But let's not kid ourselves.

253
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.480
Gender was an important factor in determining if you survived a meeting with

254
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:34.470
Matthew Hopkins.
In that same space of time when he killed 20 men,

255
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.480
Hopkins sends an estimated 200 women to the guys in September of 1645 the witch

256
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:44.710
finder general committed is most notorious acts as the doc and I drew in Hopkins

257
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:49.120
and Stern arrived in Ipswich that they tried and convicted Mary Lakeland's in a

258
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.770
shocking break with tradition rather than hanging out.

259
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.450
They decided to burn her alive as the black smoke coiled into the sky over

260
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.690
Rashmir Heath Hopkins pocketed his fee and left.

261
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.780
Perhaps he had married Lakeland screams and felt sorry for her,

262
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.850
but perhaps they made him feel good.

263
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.880
This was the Fallis Day in the history of English,

264
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:10.970
which I'm saying thankfully it would also be one of the lost

265
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.503
cause.

266
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.890
I mean it's something you might not have expected during this whole Gyn aside

267
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:23.210
thing.

268
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.440
Hopkins and Stan hadn't exactly been hiding from the authorities that EDC has

269
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:27.861
reported.

270
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:31.190
The Hopkins may have been paid for his work by official government sources.

271
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.210
Whether that's true and also there's no denying the which finding general soon

272
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:39.120
came to the attention of parliaments back in August of 1945 Hopkins,

273
00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:40.700
his conviction of John Lowe's,

274
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:43.730
that old guy that he forced to run up and down until he collapsed,

275
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.440
had resulted in a which panic and berries and Edmonds that eventually saw a

276
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.990
hundred people.
Jails had,
Hopkins had his way,

277
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:53.060
all 100 of them would have been executed,

278
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.150
but word of the gigantic which trial leaked to parliament.

279
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.340
It was simply too big to be credible.

280
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:03.170
So parliament said that own people out to retry,
everyone convicted by Hopkins.

281
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.670
This time the trials would be more careful.
They would be less tainted by bias,

282
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.380
which is why on August the 27th only 18 which were hanged,

283
00:16:11.381 --> 00:16:16.250
it buries and Edmonds rather than the 100 that Hopkins had hoped for.
Of course,

284
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:20.570
hanging 18 people for made up magic is still deranged.
But here's the thing.

285
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.141
Parliaments,

286
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:25.730
which homes is a model of sanity compared to Hopkins and it's done in light of

287
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:27.080
the near mess are berries into Edmonds.

288
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:30.590
Many mps began to wonder if Hopkins was actually a bigger danger than the

289
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:31.970
witches that he was finding.

290
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.130
It helps this by fall of 1645 the conditions that had allowed mass hysteria to

291
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:38.540
flourish,
they were on the wane.

292
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.410
The Battle of navy in June that year had seen the remaining royalist forces,

293
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:47.120
mostly crushed.
The wall was now winding down and with,
it's the famine,
hunger,

294
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:52.070
and fear that had driven the which panic swells as well as 1646 dawn's the tide

295
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:55.310
of public opinion has decisively turned against the witch finders.

296
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.660
The purex and Minister John Gold published a pamphlet that attacks Hopkins in no

297
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:02.510
uncertain terms for the slaughter that he was inflicting on.

298
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:05.990
The countryside goal was someone who actually believed in witches,

299
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:09.860
but even he could see that the witch finder general was Zadek in patrol.

300
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.710
Hopkins tried to find back.
He wrote ghoul a chilling.

301
00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:15.100
Nathan has something to come look for,
which is in his area.

302
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.570
If goal ever criticized him again,
he and Stan,

303
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:20.210
they stepped up their visits to villages,
but the game,

304
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.650
it was already up on April the 27 1646 Charles the fast was forced to flee

305
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:26.960
Oxford after it fell to parliamentary forces.

306
00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.840
Although the king would escape being taken into custody for some weeks.

307
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.900
The first English civil war,
it was either no long offset.

308
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:36.860
Parliaments Summon Tompkins and Stan accusing them of the illegal use of
torture.

309
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.040
Hopkins was now famous but not as a savior of the purists and faith rather as a

310
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.780
likely Charlotte and who'd sent countless women to their deaths.
By August,

311
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.280
1646 Hopkins has credibility with public.
It was shot.

312
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.300
Villages no longer sought him out.
The powerful no longer defended his work,

313
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.910
possibly scad parliaments,
mice,
try him in turn,

314
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:00.840
the witch finder general discounted this phony title and retired back to manning

315
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:05.610
treat his entire,
which I was in Korea I took,
lasted less than 18 months.
Still.

316
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:09.360
Hopkins had his blood money and he was respected by some of the most zealous

317
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.480
puritans,
thanks to his reputation,
and he was able to publish his book,

318
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.650
the discovery of witches in 1647 when the first edition has reached New

319
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:16.660
England's,

320
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.190
they smart off a series of which panics that would culminate in the infamous

321
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.570
1692 Salem witch trials.
Well,

322
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.850
the Hopkins would live to see the last grizzly fulfillment of his legacy in

323
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:31.851
August of 1647 at the age of just 26 or 27 Matthew Hopkins killed over and

324
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:33.810
manning tree and died.

325
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.960
While legend says that he was tried as a witch using his own methods and

326
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.340
executed,
the mundane reality appears to be this tuberculosis carried them off.

327
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.960
Yes.
Even as Hopkins died,
the whales,
he helped create.
It was already feeding.

328
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

329
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.300
<v 0>By the end of 1648 the vast majority of English women accused of witchcraft web</v>

330
00:18:56.301 --> 00:19:00.170
being acquitted,
even when the second and third English civil wars blew up,

331
00:19:00.171 --> 00:19:02.900
followed by Oliver Cromwell's puritan dictatorship.

332
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:08.050
Nothing like the which panics of 1645 took hold again 40 years later in March of

333
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:12.350
60 and 84 Alicia Marlin's became the last person to be put to death for

334
00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:13.850
witchcraft in English history.

335
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.800
That would be more trials including an infamous one in 1717 but never again

336
00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:21.860
would they result in a verdict of execution.
Now,

337
00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:26.861
let's flash forward to 1735 of full 90 years after Matthew Hopkins as Ghoulish

338
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.970
Specter,
last rooms,
the English countryside.

339
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.300
The greatest Robert Walpole was the prime minister and the superstitions of the

340
00:19:32.301 --> 00:19:36.740
17th century had given way to the scientific curiosity of the 18th that year

341
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.510
parliament passed the witchcraft act.

342
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.530
It repealed all previous which laws and all punishments for witchcraft.

343
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.370
Instead of penalize,
pretending to be a witch for profit or to influence others.

344
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.680
Think about that for a second.
Within Living Memory,

345
00:19:48.681 --> 00:19:52.580
Matthew Hopkins had slaughtered more than 200 women for being witches.

346
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.130
Now the law stated that such a thing was impossible.

347
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.760
The witchcraft was nothing more than a pretense,
a humbug.

348
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.840
We like to think that that new sent Matthew Hopkins Rolling in his grave.

349
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.390
Finally on June the 13th 1782 Swiss execution has dragged on a Goldie outdoor

350
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.710
fields and lopped off her hat.
The bloods,

351
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.070
that pattern down onto the grass would be the last blood that would ever be

352
00:20:13.071 --> 00:20:16.340
spilled in Europe.
Switch hunts over the previous three centuries,

353
00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:19.520
over 200,000 women had perished at the hands of the consonants.

354
00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:24.521
Inquisitors 300 years of misogynistic murder had finally come to an end,

355
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.671
but the story,

356
00:20:25.671 --> 00:20:29.840
it doesn't quite stop there in 1921 garden is we're doing some work on a house

357
00:20:29.841 --> 00:20:31.850
in the villages since Osa.
Then assets.

358
00:20:31.851 --> 00:20:35.030
When did they found a pair of female skeletons dating from the error of the

359
00:20:35.031 --> 00:20:35.331
English,

360
00:20:35.331 --> 00:20:39.380
which draws the two unknown women had iron reverts driven through their joints

361
00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:41.390
to stop rising from the grave.

362
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.980
It was a chilling of visceral reminder of Hopkins and his methods transported

363
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:50.020
forward to the 20th either now traces of his superstitious,
well,

364
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:54.100
if you still linger over the countryside and local hills and forgotten heath

365
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.890
named for the tortures that he inflicted there,

366
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.700
or the helpless women who died under them,
Hopkins may be gone,

367
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:04.630
but his legacy lives on the next time you hear spooky tales of which drowse

368
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.450
oases.
Someone dressed as a witch for Halloween.
I remember that.

369
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:11.740
Just spare a thought for all of the women who died at the hands of England's,

370
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:15.820
which find a general.
