6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.800
Jeremy Bentham was a man ahead of his time,
though not a philosopher.

7
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:25.680
He developed a utilitarian philosophy based on the doing of good to oneself and

8
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.310
to others.

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
He used it to proposed fundamental reforms to assist in that he saw as grossly

10
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:35.661
unjust is ideas of reverberated down through the ages do affect the worlds that

11
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.980
we live in today.
In the biographics video today,

12
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.970
we delve into the life and the teachings of Jeremy Bentham.

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.690
Jeremy Bentham was born on the 15th of February,
1748 and houndsditch London.

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.260
The Bentham's.

15
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.430
We're a family of wealth and income was derived from an extremely successful

16
00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:00.940
pawnbroking enterprise from generations past his parents,

17
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:04.360
James Nalla spend their time and social and intellectual pursuits.

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.440
Young Bentham was a child prodigy with his extraordinary abilities becoming

19
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.870
evidence very early on by the age of three.

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.500
He was reading fluently on one occasion when he had just turned three,

21
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:17.920
he was walking in the woods with his parents and some other adults.

22
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.730
The became bored with the adult conversation and decided to return home as the

23
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.620
adults who are absorbed in their conversation.

24
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:26.230
They didn't notice his departure when they returned to him.

25
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:28.120
The adults found him sitting at a reading desk,

26
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.560
absorbed and reading a book on the history of England's Jeremy's classical

27
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.950
studies again of the age of four,
the monkey journals of his father.

28
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.440
There exists a piece of paper with the following eyes.

29
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.440
The line pasted herein was risen by my son,

30
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:45.670
Jeremy Bentham on the 4th of December,
1753 at the age of five years,

31
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.430
nine months and 19 days.
The lining question,

32
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.680
but it was a long phrase in Latin.

33
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.650
This document shows not only the amazing talents of the child,

34
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:57.460
but it's also the obvious prides that the father had in his son's intellectual

35
00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:58.480
gifts.
In fact,

36
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:03.040
James was constantly bragging about the genius that lay within us by that age,

37
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:07.030
for Jeremy was learning both the Greek and the Latin languages.
James employed,

38
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.601
uh,
Clark.

39
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:11.660
And this man was given the duty of teaching young James to write as well as to

40
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.410
read music and play the violin.
By the age of six,

41
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:18.010
a regular music tutor had been employed and James with his miniature fiddle

42
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:22.960
became an adaptive violinist.
James wanted for his son to excel at everything.

43
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.500
When Jeremy was seven he was given dancing lessons and it was something that he

44
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:27.970
absolutely detested.

45
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.690
The boy was so weak that he wasn't able to support himself on his tip toes.
Yup.

46
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.740
His father repeatedly forced him to go through the exercises becoming more

47
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:38.260
exasperated with every failed attempt.

48
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.420
We're not absorbed in his studies with his father.

49
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:43.710
Jeremy loved nothing better than to spend time at the country estates of it's

50
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.970
two grandmothers at Browning Hill and barking.

51
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.140
He was a lover of nature and would spend hours exploring the flowers and the

52
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:52.000
trees on the family's grounds.

53
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.040
Why Young James was mentally superior to

54
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.210
<v 2>his peers physically,</v>

55
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.440
hey was anything but he was much shorter than other children of his age and was

56
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.290
extremely thin and weak.
When he was seven years of age,

57
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.540
he began attending Westminster School in London.

58
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.490
He immediately hated the experience.

59
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.790
It being a far contrast to the one on one instruction that had been receiving

60
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.930
all my senses.
Beth.

61
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.350
He later wrote Westminster was a wretched place for instruction.

62
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.840
I was the least boy in the school.
Then to the bigger boys,

63
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:25.450
took pleasure in pissing us one against another.

64
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.990
Bentham was entered into the upper second form due to his obvious advanced

65
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:29.620
intellects.

66
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.950
He seemed to reputation is that digital philosopher as a result of his ability

67
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.900
to reason and consider every matter.

68
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.050
His skills in Latin and Greek made him a valuable boys and no ones,

69
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.190
any of the other boys leaned on him to provide homework answers soon became a

70
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:43.960
target for bullies at the school.
However,

71
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.240
there was one boy who was just a protector for him.

72
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.950
If it wasn't for this companionship,

73
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.700
he would have been the subject of daily humiliations and his older years.

74
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.260
He spoke with disgust fagging system by which younger boys were subjected to all

75
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.610
manner of intolerant treatment.

76
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.030
He was just as dismissive of the teaching that was offered at the school,

77
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:05.590
saying that he was taught a few useful and many useless things.

78
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.260
Bentham observed that the higher the rank of the professor,

79
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.300
the less efficient the man was.

80
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.610
<v 0>Bentham persevered with the agony and is boredom of Westminster for five years.</v>

81
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.001
Finally,

82
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.450
the age of 12 he graduated and just father enrolled him at Queens College in

83
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:27.850
Oxford.
It was a remarkable achievement for such a young man to be enrolled in

84
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.590
university.

85
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.160
The fact that Bentham was extremely short for a 12 year old me didn't and even

86
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.640
greater curiosity than usual,
and he was standouts wherever he went.

87
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.000
In addition to developing an extraordinary intellectual body of knowledge,

88
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:40.200
by the time he was a teenager,

89
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.490
Bentham had also built for himself a strong moral code.
He recalls,

90
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.220
I never told a lie.
I never in my remembrance,

91
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.320
did what I knew to be a dishonest thing.

92
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.550
His father placed him under the care of a personal tutor by the name of Jacob

93
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.610
Jefferson.

94
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.900
He was a morose and gloomy past and you saw it as his duty to prevent Jeremy

95
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:01.710
from having anything that even remotely resembled fun.

96
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.070
The only thing that run basically approached one in Jeremy's life was to play at

97
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.860
shuttlecock very irregularly.
Yes.

98
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.440
Even this was unacceptable to Jefferson and d would interrupted the game and

99
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.150
Ashton the boy back to his books.

100
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.810
He instilled in Bentham's psyche that any activity that did not involve

101
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:19.890
educational advancement was a waste of time.
While at Oxford Bentham,

102
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.080
Oni received a modest allowance from his father.

103
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.630
This meant that he was forced to incur debt.

104
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.920
His father was also concerned that the boy was too timid and too shy.

105
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.600
On one occasion while visiting Oxford,

106
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.690
James took his sons the grand total at Christ church.
At the time,

107
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.940
the students there were all the sampling for dinner.

108
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.960
James instructed to sun to walk up and down the aisles and see if he could find

109
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:44.310
any of the boys that he knew.
For Jeremy.
This was a hellish assignments.

110
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.250
With each succeeding step,
he fell place it to fainting.

111
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.420
By the time he had finished,

112
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:52.890
he was red with embarrassment and it's had no acquaintances to report his father

113
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:56.880
though thought this was an excellent strategy for his son to get noticed further

114
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.170
to goal.
He bought a silk,

115
00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:01.310
a gown for journey while the other boys were playing gallons.

116
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.360
Bentham found the instruction doc so it almost is pointless and uninspiring as

117
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.040
he found the instruction at Westminster.

118
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.910
He managed at times to escape the monotony of his routine with fishing which she

119
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.380
was not particularly fond of.

120
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.860
He founds no pleasure in the company you have any other students considering the

121
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.510
vast majority of them to be in a chair.

122
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.170
Morons when he was 16 and Jeremy's father took him on a tour of France.

123
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.040
He was fascinated by the beauty and the architecture of Paris being especially

124
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.100
impressed by the one does have the palace of Versailles.
Surely.
Thereafter,

125
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.340
his father remarried January step.
Mother,

126
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.370
former Mrs Abbott's had a strange relationship with Bentham and he also spoke

127
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:35.540
with her with the lack of affection.

128
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.290
In 1766 Ben took his master's degree at Oxford with a major in law to celebrate

129
00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:43.820
his graduation.
His father gave him the gift of 20 pounds.
The following.
Yeah,

130
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.920
he left Oxford in his own estimation.

131
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:49.760
Is Education at the college had not benefits stim Jane's had intended the Jeremy

132
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.580
would use the opportunities that the college do.

133
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:55.370
You establish contacts that he would be able to exploit upon graduation in order

134
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.540
to make his way up in the wells,

135
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.680
but the boy had been unable to shake his natural timidity and he didn't build

136
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:04.370
any meaningful relationships with people who are going to help him in the
future.

137
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.370
Bentham was admitted to the bar in 1769 though he never ended up practicing law.

138
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.220
He became greatly disappointed with the English legal code,

139
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:21.520
which she considered it to be overly cumbersome and rather complex.

140
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.930
His disillusionments was compounded upon after hearing a series of lectures by

141
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:28.810
the leading legal authority of the time Sir William Blackstone.

142
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.310
After listening to Blackstone,

143
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.400
he decided that he no longer wanted to practice law.
Instead Z,

144
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.630
it was going to write about it.

145
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.590
He would spend his energy is critiquing the existing door and proposing ways

146
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.980
that it could be improved and then took another tour of France with his father

147
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:46.981
and stepmother and the latter half of 1769 in 1717 Bentham stops it upon his

148
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:50.080
extensive writing career.
His first published work,
sweat,

149
00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:54.490
two letters sent to the London Gazeta when he was 23 one of these letters,

150
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.540
he later said it was a portrait of my character and my love of Fatness,

151
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.220
Lord Mansfield had been attacked.

152
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.680
I showed that there was no evidence for the story.

153
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.160
Bentham spends an inordinate amount of time perfecting every words that he

154
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:06.994
committed it to.
Paper.

155
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.140
Everything had to be precise is that the writing's often contain the seeds of

156
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:14.920
the ideas that were fully flashed out and his more famous later works.

157
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.980
In July of 1776 the American colonies issued that declaration of independence.

158
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.460
The British government did not lower themselves to issue an official response.

159
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.240
However,
a London based pamphleteer was commissions to publish a rebuttal.

160
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.380
The man who was charged with writing this piece a lot of course was Jeremy

161
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.410
Bentham.
However,
the response was not published under Bentham's name.

162
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:43.430
That was rather the final chapter of John Lynn's onset to the declaration of

163
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:47.210
independence.
Bentham was a good friend of Len's was living at his house.

164
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:48.950
When Lynn's was commissioned to the job.

165
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.440
He was delighted to take on the Americans in print.

166
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.560
You proceeded to pull apart the declaration ruthlessly exposing its points.

167
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.520
He sets the tone in his introduction declaring the opinions of the modern

168
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.150
Americans on governments like those of their good ancestors on witchcraft would

169
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:08.130
be too ridiculous to deserve any notice if like them to contemptible and

170
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.540
extravagant as they be.

171
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.400
They had an auto lead to the most serious evils among as many critiques.

172
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:16.380
Bentham ridiculed the idea of all men being created equal,

173
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:20.400
stating that it gives equal status to the newborn baby and the magistrate.

174
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.300
He also claims that the use of the government to ensure the attainments of life,

175
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:28.350
liberty,
and pursuit of happiness is an oxymoron as the exercise of any form of

176
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.550
government well alienated,
at least one of those inalienable rights.

177
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.270
Bentham dismisses the framers of the Declaration of independence is nothing more

178
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:40.140
than a mob of radicals worse even than the German Anabaptists.

179
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.000
He concludes with sincere wishes that these ungrateful and rebellious people be

180
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.740
forced back into line.

181
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.580
I think now is the perfect time to tell you about today's sponsor brilliance.

182
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.660
These long videos,
they are made possible because of sponsors like brilliant,

183
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.410
so it would mean a lot to me if you took a moment when you're finished with this

184
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.810
video to go and check them out.

185
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.530
You're doing that really does allow us to keep doing what we do here at

186
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.660
biographics and bringing you these longer videos.

187
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.110
So Brilliance Ra science learning platform that allow you to learn through

188
00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:10.801
active learning,

189
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:13.260
which summed up is basically the opposite of that feeling of reading through

190
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:17.670
some really complex page about some principal and just having no idea what's

191
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:20.160
going on because you've never put it into practice.

192
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.730
Brilliant cover everything from the very basics,
do the very complex,

193
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:25.980
but they make it all very,
very manageable.

194
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.540
Now you've heard me talk a bunch about brilliance.

195
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:31.590
If you are a regular viewer and it's a perfect fit for this channel because hey,

196
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:35.580
if you're watching a 20 minute video on youtube that's educational,

197
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.290
you're probably like learning,

198
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:40.410
so you're probably going to be into brilliant as well.
Reasonably Brilliance.

199
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:43.410
I've made an important update to their mobile app so that courses can now be

200
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:46.560
accessed offline so you don't have to worry about having a solid internet

201
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:49.620
connection to learn things through their platform.
Also,

202
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:51.540
they've got something called daily challenges,

203
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.450
which is where every day you have a problem to solve as a great way to spend

204
00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:57.750
maybe five minutes saying like I say it on your commute and getting to grips

205
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:01.620
with a subject.
So like I say,
brilliant makes even complex concepts,

206
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.410
easy to understand.
So they give you something super short to read,

207
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.370
it's very easy to grasp and then you immediately applied to a problem or rinse

208
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:09.210
and repeat and suddenly,

209
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:12.030
or understanding very complex stuff that you didn't think you would be.

210
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.530
All courses are totally interactive,

211
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:18.531
so you can understand probability by playing blackjack of those sorts of things.

212
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.650
So if you want to support biographics that would be awesome and get access to

213
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.740
all of brilliance in depth maths and science courses.

214
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.550

216
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:37.530
into his most famous ideas and all the weird thing that happened after he died.

217
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.920
Having dismissed the American's Bentham set is focus on writing about social and

218
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:49.750
legal reforms in his beloved England's,

219
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.620
one of his pet projects was a design for an improved prison called the

220
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.454
panopticon,

221
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.910
the design of the structure and now every prisoner in the facility to be able to

222
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.630
be watched by a single God without them knowing whether or not they were under

223
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.464
observation.

224
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.380
Bentham was well aware that there was a new way that a single watchmen can

225
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.510
actually keep an eye on everyone at the same time,

226
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.450
but the fact that prisoners didn't know if they were being watched words

227
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.900
according to Bentham forced them to regulate their own behavior.
The panel.

228
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:17.500
What's gone was a second a building with a watch house in the center where a God

229
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:18.940
could monitor all of the inmates.

230
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.230
Bentham describe the design as a mill for grinding rogues.
Honest,

231
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.950
in 1791 Bentham published a book on his pan optic on plants.

232
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.430
He fully intended for the prison to be built and even plans to govern the

233
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:31.420
facility himself.

234
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.010
In 1794 he was able to interest the government of William pet in the idea he was

235
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.230
paid 2000 pounds for his plans.

236
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.280
After a number of frustrating holdups Bentham ended up buying a plot of lands on

237
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:45.790
behalf of the crowd and 1799 from his perspective,

238
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.750
the site was far from ideal when he requested more funds to go and buy lands.

239
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:52.690
He was told to simply build a smaller prison from this.

240
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:55.420
He discerned that there was no real commitment to penal reform on the parts of

241
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.170
the governments.

242
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.830
When William Pitt resigned from parliament in 1801 enthusiasm for the project

243
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:03.370
waned two years later,
it was shut down completely Benson.

244
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.780
He was crushed by the closing down of his pet project stating they have murdered

245
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.220
my best days.

246
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.310
Bentham's political philosophy is summed up in the concept of utilitarianism.

247
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.150
It is based on the principle that an action is right only if it promotes

248
00:13:23.151 --> 00:13:26.450
happiness and wrong if it does not promote happiness.

249
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.620
That happiness relates not only to the instigator of an action but to the rest

250
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:33.260
of society as well.
Bentham's answer to the question,

251
00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:37.910
what should a person do is that a person should do only that which produces the

252
00:13:37.911 --> 00:13:39.680
best consequences.
Benson,

253
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.860
he was not a professional philosopher as a critic and shaper of the law.

254
00:13:42.861 --> 00:13:46.970
He believed that his utilitarian principal should be the practical guide by

255
00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:50.720
which all people,
including the law makers in governments,
make decisions.

256
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.500
There's underlying principle was summed up by his contemporary Joseph Priestley

257
00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:57.530
as the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

258
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.250
His greatest wish was that the more makers of society would use this principle

259
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:05.660
in order to remake a more equitable and logical legal framework for society.

260
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.410
He wrote.

261
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.890
If anything could be identified as the fundamental motivation behind the

262
00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.020
developments of classical utilitarianism,

263
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:17.230
it would be the desire to see useless cropped laws and social practices changed

264
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.090
in determining what was good and what was bad.

265
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:23.690
Bentham believed that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain with the

266
00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:26.630
deciding factors,
he held it as a given that pleasure.

267
00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:30.170
It was good and that pain was bad.
The fact that a person is rich or poor,

268
00:14:30.171 --> 00:14:33.020
black or white.
Now female intelligence or dimwitted should,

269
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.370
he believes I have absolutely no bearing on their right to enjoy the same level

270
00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:41.750
of pleasure and avoid the same measure of pain as anyone else in the class

271
00:14:41.751 --> 00:14:45.650
defined society that was England at the time.
This was a pretty radical notion.

272
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.120
Benson was never interested in anything unless it could be practically applied

273
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.780
in society.
In order to help people to apply his utilitarian theory,

274
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.960
he developed what he called the hedonic calculus.
By using it,

275
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:00.680
people would be able to balance out the pleasurable and painful effects of any

276
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:04.520
proposed action they had on in calculus include seven factors which need to be

277
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:08.240
taken into account in relation to the pleasure or pain produced when considering

278
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:13.100
a course of action.
The intensity duration set and the remoteness extends piracy.

279
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.270
And if that come today or likelihood that the sensation will be followed by more

280
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.104
of the same.

281
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.560
And example of the committee that Bentham gave was smiling at a stranger.

282
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.460
This may make you feel good for a short period of time.
This am,

283
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:29.090
I also calls that stranger to smile at someone else and this could keep going

284
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:32.810
indefinitely.
So the sensation would be repeated many times over.

285
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.210
Purity is the opposite.
If a committee,

286
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.780
we might get a temporary feeling of pleasure by punching someone in the face,

287
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:41.900
but the chances are high that they will punch us right back,

288
00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:44.450
in which case we will get to the opposite sensation.

289
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.770
So the sensation is not pure,
it's quickly diluted,
so to speak.

290
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.070
And the 1790 [inaudible] became interested in helping clean up a notorious area

291
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.450
known as the pool of London.

292
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.840
This was a stretch that ran along the river Thames from London bridge down to

293
00:16:03.841 --> 00:16:04.620
line house.

294
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.190
It was the center of crime vice and all sorts of illegal activity and major

295
00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:12.000
problem was shipboard theft with merchants losing half a million pounds of

296
00:16:12.001 --> 00:16:12.691
merchandise.

297
00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:16.860
Every year of them worked with a Scottish magistrate by the name of Patrick Hoon

298
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:20.490
for a solution to the problem.
What they cannot with was the Thames River Bill,

299
00:16:20.491 --> 00:16:24.030
which was passed into law in the air racing hundreds they brought into existence

300
00:16:24.031 --> 00:16:26.370
the Thames River police.
This force,

301
00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:29.790
the first police force in England was specifically designed to stop theft and

302
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.050
looting from ships.
It was designed to act as a preventative for crime,

303
00:16:34.051 --> 00:16:36.540
which was sort of a new concept at the time

304
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.520
by the 17 ATS Bentham's writings and influence.

305
00:16:45.521 --> 00:16:47.470
It made him an influential weld thinker.

306
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.460
He was in contact with many people of note the Cavs Harper lively communication

307
00:16:51.461 --> 00:16:54.940
with Scottish economist Adam Smith in an attempt to bring about free floating

308
00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:58.720
interest rates or so was in communication with the movers and shakers of the

309
00:16:58.721 --> 00:17:00.040
French revolution.
However,

310
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:03.100
when things devolved into the mass terror of wholesale,
the headings,

311
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.440
he rounds and he criticized what was happening there.

312
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.390
Bentham is remembered as one of the earliest advocates of animal rights

313
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.280
extending his utilitarian philosophy.

314
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.920
He stated that it was not the ability to reason,

315
00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:24.921
but rather the ability to feel which determines who or what was covered by the

316
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.700
pleasure and pain principle.

317
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.480
Bentham did believe that animals could be killed for food or if a person was

318
00:17:30.481 --> 00:17:32.640
defending themselves or others from attack,

319
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:36.480
but only so long as there was no gratuitous suffering involved.

320
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.930
Bentham was also well ahead of his time when it came to the issue of women's

321
00:17:39.931 --> 00:17:41.940
rights.
In fact,
he once stated this,

322
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.600
it was the inequality in the treatment of women that he observed in his youth.

323
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.020
That first prompted him to take the role of lifelong reformer,

324
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.590
even though he was of the belief that women were both physically and

325
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:53.910
intellectually weaker than men.

326
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:58.770
His utilitarian philosophy prescribes that they should be able to enjoy equal

327
00:17:58.771 --> 00:17:59.604
rights.

328
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.900
How's he approached his eighties Benson began to give serious consideration to

329
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.460
his death and his legacy.

330
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.750
He rose detailed directions regarding what was to be done with his corpse.

331
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.440
In 1830 he wrote a paper in which he instructed the English physician,

332
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.470
Tom Southwood Smith to create what he called an auto icon and this was attached

333
00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:24.410
to his will.

334
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.760
Jeremy Bentham died on June the sixth 1832 at his home in Westminster in London.

335
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.230
According to his instructions,

336
00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:32.600
his body was dissected in the presence of his friends.

337
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.690
The auto icon was created by reconstructing the skeleton,

338
00:18:35.691 --> 00:18:37.550
replacing the head with a wax model,

339
00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:41.360
and then dressing it up in his clothes and placing it on a seat and the glass

340
00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:44.440
case.
This energy along with the mummified head of Bentham,

341
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.790
Ms Still on display at university college in London.
