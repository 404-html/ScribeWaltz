<v Speaker 1>His mother after was Samoan origin while his father wade was a black Nova</v>

<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>

19
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>To further entrenched the wrestling gene in his blood.</v>

20
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne's maternal grandfather also had been a professional wrestler,</v>

21
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>promoted as high chief Peter Maivia.</v>

22
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>He was the first simone wrestler to break into the big time.</v>

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>A generation later rocky became the first black champions who conquered the</v>

24
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>state wrestling scene.</v>

25
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Rocky hustled as a wrestler taking on bouts web ever.</v>

26
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>He could in order to support his family,</v>

27
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>times were tough with the family moving from state to state in order to keep</v>

28
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>pace with the wrestling venues.</v>

29
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.071
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

30
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>during Dwayne's formative years,</v>

31
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>the family of three lived in 38 of the 50 states as they became entrenched in</v>

32
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the gypsy wrestling lifestyle.</v>

33
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>The only time Dwayne got to see his dad was when he went on the road with him.</v>

34
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>He cherished these times and quickly fell in love with everything to do with</v>

35
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>professional wrestling.</v>

36
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>His Dad taught him some basic moves,</v>

37
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>including the sleeper hold when he was 11.</v>

38
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne was playing wrestling one school,</v>

39
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:56.201
<v Speaker 1>lunchtime.</v>

40
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>When you put the,</v>

41
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>hold on a classmate,</v>

43
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>the kids immediately parsed out.</v>

44
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

45
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>rocky had him showing his son how to bring someone out of the sleeper hold.</v>

46
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>The ambulance and the police were called and rocky has to come down to revive</v>

47
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>the students.</v>

48
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>The Johnson House became a hangouts for Dwayne.</v>

49
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Schoolmates knew that they were going to have to do several rounds with their</v>

50
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>host.</v>

51
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne would turn these events into mock TV shows where he would pretend to</v>

52
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>interview the restless.</v>

53
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>He would even interview himself as he portrayed the bad guy.</v>

54
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 1>His chairmanship was immediately evidence as he came out with all sorts of</v>

55
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>outrageous pronouncements against his intended victims do.</v>

56
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I excelled in a number of sports physically.</v>

57
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.520
<v Speaker 1>He was miles ahead of his classmates.</v>

58
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>He had his first weight workouts when he was 13.</v>

59
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>He had been tagging along with his down to the gym since he was five years old,</v>

60
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>as he sounds quietly on a bench and watched proudly as rocky pounded out pset</v>

61
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 1>after pset with Gargantuan weights.</v>

62
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne breathed in the gym atmosphere and marveled at the sight of huge men</v>

63
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:53.250
<v Speaker 1>doing seemingly impossible things with massive loads of iron.</v>

64
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>While other deans took their kids to the playgrounds at rocky,</v>

65
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>took Dwayne to most of the hardcore gyms in the country.</v>

66
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It was here that the future superstar learns that there was no replacement for</v>

67
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>pure gut wrenching hard work.</v>

68
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.211
<v Speaker 1>At the age of age,</v>

69
00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>rocky allowed Dwayne to participate in sports.</v>

70
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.451
<v Speaker 1>He tried baseball,</v>

71
00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:20.870
<v Speaker 1>soccer,</v>

72
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.561
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>

73
00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:22.430
<v Speaker 1>and gymnastics.</v>

74
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>What he really longed to do is lift weights,</v>

75
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:27.020
<v Speaker 1>but it'd have to wait a few more years to get into that.</v>

76
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

77
00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:29.120
<v Speaker 1>on his 13th birthday,</v>

78
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.710
<v Speaker 1>his dad took him to a local gym for his first ever weights workouts and obvious</v>

79
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>place to start was the bench press,</v>

80
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>which had studied for years as his dad's.</v>

81
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Now this Preston,</v>

82
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.190
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of steel from their chest.</v>

83
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Rocky had his son start with an unloaded bb.</v>

84
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.800
<v Speaker 1>He pumped out 10 reps with no problem,</v>

85
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>so rocky added a 20 lbs plates to eat.</v>

86
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Jens.</v>

87
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.620
<v Speaker 1>This time dwayne pushed out eight easy wraps,</v>

88
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.191
<v Speaker 1>impressed,</v>

89
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:52.431
<v Speaker 1>rocky,</v>

90
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 1>asked his son if he wanted to try the 45 pounders.</v>

91
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne nodded his head,</v>

92
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.780
<v Speaker 1>his dad stood behind him and lifted the bar off the supports,</v>

93
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 1>and Dwayne got buried under the 135 pound weight.</v>

94
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.950
<v Speaker 1>He felt embarrassed and ashamed as if he had let his dad down.</v>

95
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 1>That feeling fueled and intense desire to get better at the bench press.</v>

96
00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And within a few years he would be benching 400 pounds between the ages of 14</v>

97
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:15.740
<v Speaker 1>and 15.</v>

98
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne excelled in the gym.</v>

99
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 1>By the time you entered high school,</v>

100
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>he had grown it to a towering six foot three inches and tip the scale at 225</v>

101
00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:25.970
<v Speaker 1>pounds is imposing physicality,</v>

102
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>gave him a great deal of self confidence,</v>

103
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.440
<v Speaker 1>which sometimes bordering on arrogance,</v>

104
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>but his unstable home life that of his father constantly traveling,</v>

105
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 1>left him directionless when he wasn't pounding the weights.</v>

106
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.450
<v Speaker 1>As a result of this,</v>

107
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.920
<v Speaker 1>he started to get into trouble.</v>

108
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It came to a head when he was 15 and he got arrested for check fraud.</v>

109
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>His parents had to come and collect them from the police station when he looked</v>

110
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:50.390
<v Speaker 1>at his mother and father and he realized that despite living from paycheck to</v>

111
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>paycheck,</v>

112
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.660
<v Speaker 1>he was the biggest source of stress in their lives.</v>

113
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.680
<v Speaker 1>In that moment,</v>

114
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 1>he vowed that he would never cause problem for his parents again.</v>

115
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Although that was the last time that Dwayne got arrested.</v>

116
00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the last time he caused worry for rocky and data and facts of that</v>

117
00:05:03.561 --> 00:05:04.520
<v Speaker 1>very next day at school.</v>

118
00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.800
<v Speaker 1>He goes into a fight and it's knocks the other kid out.</v>

119
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It sounds in a two week suspension.</v>

120
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Upon returning to school,</v>

121
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 1>he decided that the students bathrooms was not good enough for him and so we</v>

122
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>decided to use the teachers.</v>

123
00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:15.860
<v Speaker 1>One when asked to leave,</v>

124
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.980
<v Speaker 1>he was rude to the teacher and trying to intimidate him with his physical</v>

125
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>

126
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 1>That Nice Dwayne felt pangs of guilt at the way he had treated the teacher,</v>

127
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.690
<v Speaker 1>so the next day he marched into the deepest class and holding out his hand,</v>

128
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.240
<v Speaker 1>said that he wanted to apologize for the way he had acted.</v>

129
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The day before the teacher stared at Dwayne's hand for a moment and then grabs</v>

130
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>this and told Wayne that he appreciated the apology then still holding the boy's</v>

131
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.044
<v Speaker 1>hand and he said,</v>

132
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I want you to play football for me.</v>

133
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Football proof to be a positive outlet for Dwayne's frustrations and</v>

134
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.221
<v Speaker 1>aggressions.</v>

135
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Providing him with a renewed sense of focus under the eye of coach Judy Swick.</v>

136
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>He steadily improved both as students and as an athlete,</v>

137
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>but at the time he was a high school senior.</v>

138
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>He was ranked as one of the top 10 defensive tackles in the country and it was</v>

139
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>offered a scholarship to the University of Miami.</v>

140
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>The number one college team in the United States that Miami Dwayne's combination</v>

141
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>of size,</v>

142
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.491
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

143
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>and athleticism coupled with his strong work ethic,</v>

144
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>makes him a standout from the very beginning.</v>

145
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Practice was going great and he was primed to be the only freshman on the</v>

146
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>varsity team,</v>

147
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but then tragedy struck on the last day of practice with pads.</v>

148
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>He crushed the grounds with his full weight on his shoulder.</v>

149
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>It was dislocated and the number of ligaments were torn that night.</v>

150
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>He had reconstructive surgery and was told that it need a year to recover.</v>

151
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>He was not able to play before the season had even begun.</v>

152
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne,</v>

153
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>he fell into a deep depression and not even bothering to go to class.</v>

154
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Then without even attempting and eve as midterms.</v>

155
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>He hopped on a flight and returned home,</v>

156
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>which at that time was in Tampa,</v>

157
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

158
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.720
<v Speaker 1>After a couple of weeks,</v>

159
00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>he got a call from Miami's head coach,</v>

160
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Erickson.</v>

161
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>He told Duane that he wants to be back at school in two days because he wants</v>

162
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you to talk to him when they mess up.</v>

163
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Erickson was furious with Johnson.</v>

164
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>He told him that he had embarrassed himself and the team Erickson had trusted</v>

165
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>him with a position of responsibility and leadership and he had completely let</v>

166
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>him down.</v>

167
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Ericsson then placed Dwayne onto academic probation.</v>

168
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>He was to attend every class,</v>

169
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>every practice,</v>

170
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 1>and every game simply sitting on the sideline.</v>

171
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

172
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>to get it into daily practice,</v>

173
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>he had to get the signatures of every one of his professors attesting that he</v>

174
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>had been to class that day.</v>

175
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.633
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't,</v>

176
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>he would lose his scholarship.</v>

177
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne dug deep and did what had to be done.</v>

178
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>He eventually became academic captain in his junior year and was preseason all</v>

179
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

180
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>He graduated from Miami University in Nineteen Ninety five with a bachelor of</v>

181
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>general studies and criminology and physiology.</v>

182
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It was at the University of Miami that Dwayne first met Danny Garcia,</v>

183
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>his future wife.</v>

184
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>They were married in 1997 and divorced 10 years later.</v>

185
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 1>After a years injury recovery,</v>

186
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne wasn't quite as fast or mobile as he was on the football field.</v>

187
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He was taken from the team and replaced by Warren Sapp after graduation from</v>

188
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Miami.</v>

189
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.791
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne,</v>

190
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:02.451
<v Speaker 1>when to Calgary.</v>

191
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Canada is a practice squad player for the stampeders.</v>

192
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Things were tough am in Canada.</v>

193
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>You had hardly any money and very few prospects,</v>

194
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.180
<v Speaker 1>but things got worse when he was cut from the stampede.</v>

195
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 1>A squad after just two months</v>

196
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 1>arriving back at his parents' tiny apartments in Tampa,</v>

197
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne was now at rock bottom.</v>

198
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>It his football career,</v>

199
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 1>whereas effectively over at do,</v>

200
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you needed to look in another direction.</v>

201
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>He thought deeply and realized that his life and his passion had always been</v>

202
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>professional wrestling.</v>

203
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>If he never turned his hand to it,</v>

204
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>he would ever be unfulfilled and if he was going to step into that wells,</v>

205
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>well now is the time.</v>

206
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>His mother runs.</v>

207
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Girlfriends encouraged him to go for it,</v>

208
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>but Dwayne's dad had major reservations.</v>

209
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Rocky knew firsthand just how tough the life of wrestler was and he wanted more</v>

210
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:56.710
<v Speaker 1>for his son,</v>

211
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but he vowed to stands behind his son.</v>

212
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>So long as he put in 110 percent effort into becoming successful.</v>

213
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Rocky now became Dwayne's fulltime wrestling coach.</v>

214
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.143
<v Speaker 1>From the start though,</v>

215
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>he talks him much more than simple wrestling moves.</v>

216
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 1>He taught him how to be a showman.</v>

217
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>After a few months of intensive work,</v>

218
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>rocky felt his son was ready to take the next step.</v>

219
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes in touch with a former wrestler named Pat Patterson,</v>

220
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.730
<v Speaker 1>who was now a talent agents.</v>

221
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Patterson came to check out what's Dwayne looks like in the ring,</v>

222
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>impressed.</v>

223
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>He arranged for a signing with the wwe.</v>

224
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne was put into the minor leagues and it was given the name rocky Maivia in</v>

225
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>homage to both his father and his grandfather.</v>

226
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 1>He started wrestling and smaller arenas for $20 a pop,</v>

227
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't take long before he got his break.</v>

228
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 1>The 1996 wwe survivor series was televised live on tv from Madison Square Garden</v>

229
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and to the new kids on the block was rocky Maivia.</v>

230
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>He made an immediate impression establishing himself as a rising wwe star by</v>

231
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 1>becoming the last man standing.</v>

232
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Rocky took on a charismatic in your face persona,</v>

233
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 1>which proved to be too loud and too arrogant for many diehard wwe fans.</v>

234
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 1>His character was rejected for being too tacky and fans came to see rocky Maivia</v>

235
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>as an extremely unlikable character.</v>

236
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.411
<v Speaker 1>When he wrestled,</v>

237
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the stadium would be listed with signs,</v>

238
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 1>reading rocky socks and a die rocky die,</v>

239
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but his perseverance and the constant refining of his character.</v>

240
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Eventually one of the fans over fans getting to appreciate the much of rocky's</v>

241
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:19.981
<v Speaker 1>narcissism,</v>

242
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>was tongue in cheek,</v>

243
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>much in the mold of Muhammad Ali,</v>

244
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 1>and they began to enjoy his over the top sense of humor when he shortened his</v>

245
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 1>name to with the rock.</v>

246
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.251
<v Speaker 1>Fans embraced this,</v>

247
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and within a year he had transformed the wrestler.</v>

248
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Everyone loves to hate to the People's champ</v>

249
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 1>from 1997 and 1998.</v>

250
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 1>So the rock had ongoing battles with stone cold Steve Austin,</v>

251
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>triple h and mankind's throughout 1999,</v>

252
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>the wwe championship belts pause between the Rock and mankind several times</v>

253
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.360
<v Speaker 1>during a series of epic encounters.</v>

254
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Then towards the end of 99,</v>

255
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the two team dumped it,</v>

256
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>become the rock and socket connection and went on to win the tag team</v>

258

<v Speaker 1>live telecasts.</v>

259
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 1>One of them was a take of this is your life in which mankind interviewed people</v>

262
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Though the Rock was suspended indefinitely.</v>

263
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 1>During the airing of raw is war.</v>

264
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 1>He used the suspension as an opportunity to move into the action and Rena still,</v>

265
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 1>he would return again and again to the wrestling ring in 2011.</v>

266
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>He was the host of Wrestlemania.</v>

267

269
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 1>who he had already been calling out on social media.</v>

270
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>A few develops between the two,</v>

271
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>which continued for another two years.</v>

272
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>When he finally stepped away from the wrestling ring.</v>

273
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:47.910
<v Speaker 1>In 2016,</v>

276
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.600
<v Speaker 1>in the business of sentiments,</v>

277
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.200
<v Speaker 1>which was echoed by John [inaudible].</v>

278
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.800
<v Speaker 1>One of his many catchphrases.</v>
