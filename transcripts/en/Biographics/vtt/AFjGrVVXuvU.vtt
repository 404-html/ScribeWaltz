1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.081
<v Speaker 1>Very curious,</v>

2
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>discoveries in radiation changed the world.</v>

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>She became one of the most important women in science and research is still</v>

4
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>important to scientists and doctors today.</v>

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>She'd be having the first person,</v>

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>male or female,</v>

7
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>to win the Nobel prize twice.</v>

8
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And Marie's discovery of the element radium helps unlock the mysteries of the</v>

9
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>asam.</v>

10
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Yet she came from the most unlikely of circumstances.</v>

11
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Marie Curie showed us that through hard work and determination,</v>

12
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>anything is possible.</v>

13
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So in this week's biographics where you meet Marie Curie,</v>

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>scientific pioneer,</v>

15
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it was like a new world opened up to me,</v>

16
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the world of science,</v>

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Maria Salamis split.</v>

18
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Oscar was born on November the seventh,</v>

19
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

20
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>67 in Warsaw opponents.</v>

21
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>She was the fifth child bones or you've let us love and Brenna slower</v>

22
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who were both teachers Vladislav toward high school physics and</v>

23
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.131
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>

24
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And although bronner slower,</v>

25
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I gave birth to five children in eight years and had tuberculosis.</v>

26
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>She was the full time director of a private school for girls.</v>

27
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>It was only after the birth of Maria that she finally retired through a series</v>

28
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>of bad investments.</v>

29
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>The family had unfortunately lost their savings,</v>

30
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>requiring them to board at the private school where bronner slower had taught.</v>

31
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.531
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

32
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>meant that for the children there was no privacy and they had to keep quiet and</v>

33
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>on their best behavior at all times as it has mentioned,</v>

34
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>bronislaw slower suffered from tuberculosis.</v>

35
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>She was terrified of passing the lung disease onto her children so she refused</v>

36
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>to hug them or show any physical affection.</v>

37
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>When Maria,</v>

38
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>who was known as Monia,</v>

39
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>was around five,</v>

40
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the family managed to get a place of their own that they had to take in boarders</v>

41
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>in order to make ends meet manual.</v>

42
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have her own bedroom,</v>

43
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>but had to sleep on the sofa in the dining room as part of her chores.</v>

44
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>She had to get up early in order to set the table for breakfast.</v>

45
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Menu was fascinated with the instruments that are father,</v>

46
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>who was a teacher of physics captain.</v>

47
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:55.764
<v Speaker 1>His little study,</v>

48
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>especially the electroscope when she started school in Eighteen,</v>

49
00:01:59.161 --> 00:01:59.731
<v Speaker 1>74,</v>

50
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>age six.</v>

51
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>She was the youngest and the smallest child there.</v>

52
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

53
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>she proved herself to the among the smartest of the students in her class.</v>

54
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>She has an excellent memory,</v>

55
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>so she was often selected to recite poetry for visitors.</v>

56
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>This was something that the intensely shy girl absolutely detested life in</v>

57
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Poland.</v>

58
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It was tough during the latter half of the 19th century.</v>

59
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Warsaw was under Russian.</v>

60
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Rule law forbids the speaking of Polish or the learning of any Polish history.</v>

61
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

62
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>these laws totally backfired,</v>

63
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>causing many polls,</v>

64
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>including manuals,</v>

65
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>family to be even more proud of that Polish heritage.</v>

66
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Manny had dreamed of doing great things and bringing honor to their country when</v>

67
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Monica was just eight years old or older sisters.</v>

68
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Sophia caught typhus and died about two years later and manuals.</v>

69
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Mother,</v>

70
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>she died from tuberculosis.</v>

71
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>That is all girl was inconsolable.</v>

72
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>The two dearest people in her life,</v>

73
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>her sister and her mother had been cruelly snatched away from her.</v>

74
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Despite her despair manual was able to maintain top grades at school with the</v>

75
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>love and support her father and remaining siblings.</v>

76
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>She began to dream about an accomplished future.</v>

77
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>In 1883,</v>

78
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>she completed a high school education.</v>

79
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>She was the first in her class in every single subjects.</v>

80
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter though,</v>

81
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>she became ill with what was called fatigue of growth and study.</v>

82
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>She spent a year recovering with relatives in the country.</v>

83
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.940
<v Speaker 1>On her return,</v>

84
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Anya was intends on furthering her education in the sciences,</v>

85
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:30.951
<v Speaker 1>but the Russian government's forbid any Polish wound from attending the</v>

86
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>University of Warsaw Year made a pact with her older sister.</v>

87
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They would pull their finances so that first and then Munya could attend the</v>

88
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.950
<v Speaker 1>University of Paris Manya spend the next six years as governor,</v>

89
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>which means that she was this more than a seven to a wealthy family for three</v>

90
00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and a half of those years.</v>

91
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>She lived with us around risky families,</v>

92
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.630
<v Speaker 1>60 miles from Warsaw.</v>

93
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.260
<v Speaker 1>She tutored the children seven hours a day and wasn't the Beck and call of the</v>

94
00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:55.470
<v Speaker 1>remainder of the family at all times with the father's approval.</v>

95
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>She also taught to local peasant children to read and write and illegal activity</v>

96
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>for which she could have been severely punished.</v>

97
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 1>She used every moment of our precious free time in order to study.</v>

98
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.551
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

99
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:09.870
<v Speaker 1>manual also began attending secret meetings of the floating university members</v>

100
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:13.020
<v Speaker 1>read about scientific and other works that were bounded by the Russians because</v>

101
00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>they thought that they might stir up rebellious ideas.</v>

102
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>After a year of living with this family,</v>

103
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>my oldest son,</v>

104
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.760
<v Speaker 1>he was home from university.</v>

105
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>He ends Manya now age 19,</v>

106
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>quickly fell in love,</v>

107
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

108
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.080
<v Speaker 1>around skis,</v>

109
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.270
<v Speaker 1>refused to let their son marry a poor governess.</v>

110
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>The unhappy couples separated but money.</v>

111
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I kept working for the family because Bronwyn was depending on her in order to</v>

112
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Speaker 1>pay her way to get over the heartbreak,</v>

113
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>threw herself into her studies.</v>

114
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>She focused on physics and chemistry in 18,</v>

115
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>99 employments with skis and this,</v>

116
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>and she moved back to Warsaw where she began working for another family.</v>

117
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.960
<v Speaker 1>One of her cousins ran Warsaw's Museum of Industry and agriculture,</v>

118
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>which was a lab with punish students,</v>

119
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>including Manya,</v>

120
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.340
<v Speaker 1>could study science.</v>

121
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.131
<v Speaker 1>By 18,</v>

122
00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 1>91.</v>

123
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Marie had saved enough money for her to join Bron in Paris and it was here that</v>

124
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:03.860
<v Speaker 1>she actually changed the name to Maria,</v>

125
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the French fashion off her name,</v>

126
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>living with Ron owns a new husband's.</v>

127
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Murray attended these civilian university before long she tired of the commute,</v>

128
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>isn't moved into the student area and living in a tiny attic with no proper</v>

129
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:16.310
<v Speaker 1>lighting and only a coal stove.</v>

130
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.450
<v Speaker 1>She had very little money,</v>

131
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.290
<v Speaker 1>ate poorly,</v>

132
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.740
<v Speaker 1>and sat to pay for our lessons and work long hours in the university library to</v>

133
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 1>do so.</v>

134
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Yet she founds a work so satisfying that the hardships were worth.</v>

135
00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a hot marie,</v>

136
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.680
<v Speaker 1>had to work much harder than her classmates due to her limited understanding of</v>

137
00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>the French language.</v>

138
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.971
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

139
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:35.450
<v Speaker 1>she graduated in 1893 having earned a master's degree in physics.</v>

140
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 1>She also got to the top marks in her class.</v>

141
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

142
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>she won a scholarship which allowed her to begin studying for a second degree</v>

143
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.000
<v Speaker 1>this time in mathematics</v>

144
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.710
<v Speaker 1>while studying for mathematics degree,</v>

145
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:50.040
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

146
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>got a job at studying the magnetism of various types of steel for a French</v>

147
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 1>company to do the work.</v>

148
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

149
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>she needed to find a lab,</v>

150
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>a friend introduced it to a man who could help it do so.</v>

151
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>His name was Pierre Curie.</v>

152
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>A teacher ran the head of the lab at the School of industrial physics and</v>

153
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>chemistry in Paris.</v>

154
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 1>He was already famous at this point for his work with crystals and magnets or</v>

155
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>anything on doing our investigations on the different types of steel.</v>

156
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 1>This continued researching the effect of electricity on crystals.</v>

157
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>No one was more surprised than carry herself when he became attracted to Murray.</v>

158
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>This man of science considered most women to be a waste of space.</v>

159
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yet Marie,</v>

160
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>she was different.</v>

161
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>She was brilliant and had a deep love for science.</v>

162
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Instead of wooing her with flowers per attempted to steal Marie's hot,</v>

163
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>like giving her an autographed copy of one of his physics papers,</v>

164
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>asked Maria to marry him shortly after they met Marie wanted to say yes,</v>

165
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but felt that if she did marry,</v>

166
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 1>she would never again live in her beloved Poland.</v>

167
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>After completing her mathematics degree,</v>

168
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>she returned to Warsaw for a holiday.</v>

169
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if she would have to go back to Paris.</v>

170
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

171
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 1>she was bombarded with love letters from piano.</v>

172
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>She finally decided to return in order to continue her education and to see</v>

173
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Maria went married on July the 26th,</v>

174
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

175
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.673
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>

176
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.300
<v Speaker 1>the ever practical Marie or a dark blue suit that she could later were in the</v>

177
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>lab for the next year.</v>

178
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>She worked in studying steel magnetism in August 18,</v>

179
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:11.301
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

180
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth to Irene,</v>

181
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>that first child becoming a mother.</v>

182
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Though it didn't slow her down,</v>

183
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>she decided to earn a doctorate in physics and needed a new topic to study.</v>

184
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.020
<v Speaker 1>She had heard about a French physicist named Henri background,</v>

185
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Raul and his discovery of mysterious uranium raise in 1896.</v>

186
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The subjects fascinated turn.</v>

187
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>She decided to make it the focus of a doctorate</v>

188
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.561
<v Speaker 1>in November 18,</v>

189
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 1>93.</v>

190
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Wilhelm and a German physicist discovered it invisible penetrating rays coming</v>

191
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:41.860
<v Speaker 1>from an electric tube.</v>

192
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.970
<v Speaker 1>In one of his experiments,</v>

193
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>he called the Max rates because we just didn't know what they were.</v>

194
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.000
<v Speaker 1>They had the ability to pass through flesh and other substances,</v>

195
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but not through hard dense materials like bones and thick metals.</v>

196
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.710
<v Speaker 1>X Rays and their effects became world famous within months in 18,</v>

197
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:57.191
<v Speaker 1>96,</v>

198
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 1>the French physicist on Rebif [inaudible] discovered more kinds of penetrating</v>

199
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

200
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.343
<v Speaker 1>unlike Rincon,</v>

201
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.240
<v Speaker 1>which were made by an electrical effects.</v>

202
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.590
<v Speaker 1>These reviews that seem to come naturally for the use of uranium that had left</v>

203
00:08:08.591 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Speaker 1>the uranium lying on a sealed packet of photographic paper for several days in a</v>

204
00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:12.611
<v Speaker 1>drawer,</v>

205
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and it caused the paper to miss over.</v>

206
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.520
<v Speaker 1>The uranium seemed to produce some kind of invisible rays that could pass</v>

207
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 1>through the thick black paper.</v>

208
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Most scientists,</v>

209
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.990
<v Speaker 1>they ignored the uranium raise,</v>

210
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but not Marie Curie.</v>

211
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>She threw herself into the study first,</v>

212
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.520
<v Speaker 1>systematically searching for uranium type of rays coming from other elements,</v>

213
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 1>checking through all 70 elements.</v>

214
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 1>She found that thorium gave off raise.</v>

215
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Next Marie analyzed rocks that contain more than one elements as she expected.</v>

216
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Most of the uranium type raised given off by the rocks called pitch blend.</v>

217
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 1>This was because they contain to uranium or thorium,</v>

218
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but surprise pitch blend gave off more radiation than she expected,</v>

219
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.150
<v Speaker 1>and the question then came to mind,</v>

220
00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:52.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

221
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 1>what was causing this extra radiation?</v>

222
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Also tracking our results more than 20 times.</v>

223
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Maria announced in July of [inaudible] 98 that she had found a new elements.</v>

224
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.950
<v Speaker 1>She names it Polonia laughter,</v>

225
00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:08.000
<v Speaker 1>her beloved Poland.</v>

226
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.961
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

227
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:13.310
<v Speaker 1>she invented the word radioactive to describe a polonium uranium and thorium.</v>

228
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Then in December of 18,</v>

229
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.321
<v Speaker 1>98,</v>

230
00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Maria announced the discovery of another new and even more radioactive elements</v>

231
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.060
<v Speaker 1>radium,</v>

232
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>but this was just the beginning because years of work layer hat Marie and Pierre</v>

233
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.620
<v Speaker 1>had has approved to fellow scientists that polonium and radium existed,</v>

234
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.573
<v Speaker 1>and to do this,</v>

235
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.670
<v Speaker 1>that to produce the two elements in their purest forms,</v>

236
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.690
<v Speaker 1>find the weight of the atoms and show that each element has an atomic weight</v>

237
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>different from any other elements,</v>

238
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.440
<v Speaker 1>but their first focus.</v>

239
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 1>It was to produce pure radiant.</v>

240
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:42.920
<v Speaker 1>To do this,</v>

241
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.000
<v Speaker 1>they needed a two things,</v>

242
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>lots of pitch blends,</v>

243
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>and to a large lab.</v>

244
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.360
<v Speaker 1>The pitch blends came from a mine in Australia and securities were able to buy</v>

245
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it out very cheaply.</v>

246
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Finding lab space though that was harder.</v>

247
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.930
<v Speaker 1>The only room available was a Kohl's leaky shed and the ops work,</v>

248
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>but it gave them the source that they needed.</v>

249
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Maria had some sales pitch Blanton's in huge parts and stereo with a steel rod</v>

250
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.610
<v Speaker 1>almost as tall as he was.</v>

251
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Despite the hard work,</v>

252
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>she was determined to discover everything she could about radioactivity between</v>

253
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:10.790
<v Speaker 1>1,919 Oh,</v>

254
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:14.180
<v Speaker 1>three and Marie published many papers on her work during this period.</v>

255
00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:18.170
<v Speaker 1>She was also completing her doctoral degree in trying to produce pure radium as</v>

256
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 1>if that was not enough.</v>

257
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:19.671
<v Speaker 1>In 1900.</v>

258
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:23.180
<v Speaker 1>She began teaching at a teacher's college in Sephora represents suburb,</v>

259
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.100
<v Speaker 1>and of course she was raising her daughter Irene on July the 21st 19.</v>

260
00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:28.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

261
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:31.510
<v Speaker 1>two Marie finally reported the weight of one radium assonance.</v>

262
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>This was a major breakthrough because of the weight of the radium atom was</v>

263
00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:37.430
<v Speaker 1>different from the atomic weight of any other elements.</v>

264
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.270
<v Speaker 1>It proved that Marie had indeed discovered a new element.</v>

265
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Marie and Pierre could have become rich by claiming all rights to working with</v>

266
00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:45.890
<v Speaker 1>radium.</v>

267
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.311
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

268
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 1>they shared their information,</v>

269
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>telling people how they purified the elements and much more.</v>

270
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.080
<v Speaker 1>They believed scientific research should benefit everybody.</v>

271
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.951
<v Speaker 1>In Nineteen,</v>

272
00:10:58.951 --> 00:10:59.051
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

273
00:10:59.051 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

274
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Maria became the first woman in Europe to receive a doctorate in science,</v>

275
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.480
<v Speaker 1>but as the fame of the Uber Science coupled group,</v>

276
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.500
<v Speaker 1>their physical health began to deteriorate.</v>

277
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>PA was constantly tired and in pain,</v>

278
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:12.480
<v Speaker 1>and Maria was also in a constant state of exhaustion.</v>

279
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>She had recently had a miscarriage and had lost a lot of weight.</v>

280
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.240
<v Speaker 1>They both also suffered from burns,</v>

281
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 1>numb fingertips.</v>

282
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>We now know that they were suffering from the effects of radiation exposure at</v>

283
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>the time radium was being touted for its health benefits because it could kill</v>

284
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:27.984
<v Speaker 1>healthy tissue.</v>

285
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Doctors tested it on disease cells and found that it also destroyed them.</v>

286
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:32.641
<v Speaker 1>Soon.</v>

287
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Radium was being used to stop cancer cells from growing in patients with cancer.</v>

288
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>The new treatments,</v>

289
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 1>it was called Curie therapy in November 19.</v>

290
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:40.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

291
00:11:40.451 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>three marine pr.</v>

292
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 1>We're given the Humphry Davy metal England's highest award in chemistry,</v>

293
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>but the greatest accolade that came a month later when they,</v>

294
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:49.590
<v Speaker 1>along with Henri Becquerel,</v>

295
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>won the Nobel Prize for physics.</v>

296
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 1>The Nobel prize came with a substantial cash award.</v>

297
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>This allowed the curious for the first time to hire a lab assistants.</v>

298
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Now reporters and visitors,</v>

299
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.780
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to meet the famous scientific couple.</v>

300
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Some eager report has even attempted to interview the curious young daughter</v>

301
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Irene Nobel prize winners have to travel to Sweden to receive their reward and</v>

302
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>speak about their work,</v>

303
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 1>but Marie was too ill to go.</v>

304
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until 1995 that she was able to make the trip.</v>

305
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>The couple's feelings about the prize,</v>

306
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:17.411
<v Speaker 1>though they wouldn't.</v>

307
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Next Marie was proud of our work and Tara accomplishments of being the first</v>

308
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>woman to achieve world fame as a scientist.</v>

309
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>The prize money also helps to fund their research,</v>

310
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 1>which they had so far been paying for out of their own pockets,</v>

311
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but they disliked the theme that came along with the award feeling that it</v>

312
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>interfered with our work.</v>

313
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1984,</v>

314
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Marie gave birth to her second daughter Eve.</v>

315
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

316
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 1>pro has made a professor at the Sorbonne and he was given about a laboratory.</v>

317
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:41.501
<v Speaker 1>Ends.</v>

318
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Marie was paid as his chief assistance.</v>

319
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 1>The next year he was elected to the Academy of Sciences.</v>

320
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.500
<v Speaker 1>For two years.</v>

321
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Things went well for the calories.</v>

322
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.550
<v Speaker 1>They were finally comfortable financially and were respected leaders in their</v>

323
00:12:56.551 --> 00:12:57.140
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

324
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Then in April of Nineteen,</v>

325
00:12:58.341 --> 00:12:58.431
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

326
00:12:58.431 --> 00:13:00.320
<v Speaker 1>six tragedy struck there,</v>

327
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:04.190
<v Speaker 1>just enjoyed a relaxed weekend in the country and we're back in rainy Paris.</v>

328
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.890
<v Speaker 1>A rushed off his feet per was running errands in the rain.</v>

329
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:10.460
<v Speaker 1>When he stepped down to cross the road and fell in front of a horse drawn wagon,</v>

330
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.080
<v Speaker 1>the sort of horse reared up and it's he was missed,</v>

331
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.410
<v Speaker 1>but the rear wheels crushed his skull,</v>

332
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.610
<v Speaker 1>killing him instantly.</v>

333
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.160
<v Speaker 1>When word spread that a famous scientist had been killed,</v>

334
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the crowd had to be stopped from attacking the innocent driver.</v>

335
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Marie didn't tear about the tragedy until she returned time that night.</v>

336
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.700
<v Speaker 1>She was simply devastated by her husband's death.</v>

337
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.390
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

338
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.190
<v Speaker 1>she remembers what he had once told her.</v>

339
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Whatever happens,</v>

340
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.780
<v Speaker 1>even if one should become like a body without a soul,</v>

341
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.970
<v Speaker 1>still one must work,</v>

342
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.400
<v Speaker 1>so when she was offered her husband's job at the Sorbonne,</v>

343
00:13:40.401 --> 00:13:42.860
<v Speaker 1>she accepts it before her first class reporters,</v>

344
00:13:42.861 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 1>students and curious people crowded the whole to see the first female teacher at</v>

345
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 1>the institution.</v>

346
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.810
<v Speaker 1>They wondered if she would praise the husbands or break down under the strain.</v>

347
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

348
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.000
<v Speaker 1>she began quietly speaking,</v>

349
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Speaker 1>picking up at the very spot where peer had left off during his last lecture.</v>

350
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.220
<v Speaker 1>One of Marie's deepest regrets was the peer who died without ever having his own</v>

351
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.083
<v Speaker 1>permanent lab.</v>

352
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Speaker 1>It gave a great satisfaction in 1989 when plans were put in place to establish</v>

353
00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:08.360
<v Speaker 1>the radium adds to use in Paris.</v>

354
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It would have a laboratory that Maria would supervise and it would be known as</v>

355
00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:12.920
<v Speaker 1>the Curie pavilion</v>

356
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>working as hard as ever Merinos did the Lord Calvin,</v>

357
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:23.080
<v Speaker 1>they Scottish physicists,</v>

358
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 1>had suggested that radium was not an elements since it had been found to give</v>

359
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>off helium gas,</v>

360
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 1>which is itself an elements.</v>

361
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>She continued to make even purer polonium and radium by 1910.</v>

362
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 1>She had produced pure radium and show to the attic was a brilliant white metal.</v>

363
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>She even found its melting point,</v>

364
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 1>which was 700 degrees Celsius in 1910.</v>

365
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Marie also published on 971 page work treatise on radioactivity and in 1911,</v>

366
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Kim and other great honor,</v>

367
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel Prize for chemistry,</v>

368
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 1>which was awarded to her alone for making pure radium.</v>

369
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>In Nineteen Eleven Radiology,</v>

370
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Congress and International Group of radiation scientists decided they needed a</v>

371
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>new unit of measurement for radiation and they called it the curie.</v>

372
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Maria insisted that she was the only one who could take on the task of working</v>

373
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 1>out to the exact size of a curie eunice.</v>

374
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 1>It was painstaking work,</v>

375
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 1>but she did it all mps on it.</v>

376
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.791
<v Speaker 1>In 1911,</v>

377
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Marie found to be elected to the French Academy of Sciences.</v>

378
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Many people said that it was simply because she was a woman,</v>

379
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>a scientific work.</v>

380
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It was the highest quality by this point.</v>

381
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Our personal life was being followed closely by the newspapers and it was great</v>

382
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.560
<v Speaker 1>interest in her friendship with physicist,</v>

383
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 1>colleague Paul longer vault,</v>

384
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 1>extremely upset by all this attention where you fell ill often treatment she</v>

385
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:36.050
<v Speaker 1>stayed with our friends have gotten in England by 1914.</v>

386
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>The radium institute at the University of Paris was finished the same year that</v>

387
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.030
<v Speaker 1>weld wall one began.</v>

388
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Murray threw herself into the war effort.</v>

389
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.460
<v Speaker 1>She organized extra equipment for hospitals to help them locate bullets and trap</v>

390
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 1>null in the wounds of injured soldiers.</v>

391
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>She also set up a course to train people in the use of radiography units.</v>

392
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Other wars ends.</v>

393
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 1>In 1918,</v>

394
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Maria became director of the Paris radium institutes.</v>

395
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 1>The institutes became a World Center for radiation physics and chemistry.</v>

396
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.033
<v Speaker 1>In 1920,</v>

397
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 1>murray became friends with Marie Maloney and American journalist.</v>

398
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Let me helps to improve curious public image and plan to raise money for the</v>

399
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 1>radium institute by a lecture tour in the USA.</v>

400
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Although our hearing and sight we're failing her,</v>

401
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 1>she carried out part of the tour before her illness for starter,</v>

402
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 1>retired to France.</v>

403
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Many university is awarded a special degrees and the women of America gave her a</v>

404
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 1>one gram of radium worth 100,000 dollars.</v>

405
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:28.250
<v Speaker 1>This was in recognition of our work and achievements as a female scientist in</v>

406
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 1>1922,</v>

407
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 1>she was last elected to the French Academy of Medicine.</v>

408
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.400
<v Speaker 1>In the Early Nineteen Twenty 20th,</v>

409
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 1>scientists finally realized the dangers of radiation.</v>

410
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 1>People working with radioactive material began taking precautions,</v>

411
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.440
<v Speaker 1>but it was too late for Marie.</v>

412
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.040
<v Speaker 1>How work with radiation probably caused the cataract in our eyes that now</v>

413
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>threatens out with blindness.</v>

414
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.210
<v Speaker 1>She had to have four operations to remove the cataracts,</v>

415
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but wanted no one to know.</v>

416
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 1>She didn't want people thinking she was old and helpless.</v>

417
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Marie continued to oversee the work in their own labs in Paris.</v>

418
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 1>She also traveled to raise funds for research by younger scientists.</v>

419
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Speaker 1>In 1928,</v>

420
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.770
