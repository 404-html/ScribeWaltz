1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Speaker 1>He was the king of Kung Fu,</v>

2
00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>the deadliest human fighting machine that the world has ever seen.</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Bringing a new level of excitement of the silver screen.</v>

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>He established himself as the first oriental superstar build as the fittest man</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>He has the world at his feet.</v>

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly he was gone dead at the age of 32 and the almost 50 years since</v>

8
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:22.261
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

9
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>his legend has propelled Bruce Lee to mythical proportions.</v>

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>we go beyond the legends and reveal the Real Bruce Lee.</v>

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>The trials here,</v>

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>the wells would knew as Bruce Lee was born on November the 27th of 1940 and the</v>

14
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Jackson Street hospital in San Francisco's China town.</v>

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>His mother gracefully.</v>

16
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It was the company in our husbands the Axle,</v>

17
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii Chong on a tour of the United States with a Cantonese opera company of</v>

18
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong.</v>

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Grace named the child Jew Fang meaning return.</v>

20
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the doctor delivering him,</v>

22
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.091
<v Speaker 1>nicknamed him.</v>

23
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee's stayed in San Francisco for five months before returning to Hong</v>

24
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Kong,</v>

25
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>but the heat and the humidity of Asia did not agree with baby Bruce.</v>

26
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>He became a sickly child with his mother constantly doting on him.</v>

27
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Grace has already lost a Charles and it was determined that she would not lose a</v>

28
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

29
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.923
<v Speaker 1>As he grew older there,</v>

30
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Bruce became stronger.</v>

31
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.610
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

32
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>he became so active that his mother nicknamed him,</v>

33
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>never sits still.</v>

34
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>The only time he stopped running,</v>

35
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:29.151
<v Speaker 1>jumping,</v>

36
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>or striking the air was when he was curled up in the corner with a book in his</v>

37
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

38
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>His long hours of reading into the nice caused him to become near scientists and</v>

39
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>at age six he required reading bosses.</v>

40
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Bruce grew up in a crowded bus or flat along with his family.</v>

41
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>There was that if his late brother so that nearly 20 people were squashed into</v>

42
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>the a chaotic household.</v>

43
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Still the leaves were among the wealthiest families in Hong Kong along with his</v>

44
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:52.371
<v Speaker 1>opera income,</v>

45
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>how he and received payments from rental properties.</v>

46
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Bruce spent much of his time amusing himself on the streets of Hong Kong.</v>

47
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>He showed me listen to interest in school and would often cut class to hang out</v>

48
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>on the streets with local hoods.</v>

49
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was 10 he had developed a pension for practical jokes.</v>

50
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>These started out innocent enough,</v>

51
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>but soon took on a more sinister touch once he pushed his sister Phoebe into a</v>

52
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>swimming pool and she retaliated by holding his head under the water until he</v>

53
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>promised to never do it again.</v>

54
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>From that day on,</v>

55
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.631
<v Speaker 1>he promised,</v>

56
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

57
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>never go in a swimming pool.</v>

58
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.683
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

60
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Bruce is acts in Korea.</v>

61
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Began that just three months thanks to his father's connections in the local</v>

62
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>entertainment industry.</v>

63
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>His first real acting role occurred when he was six years old.</v>

64
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>He plays a rebellious streak.</v>

65
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Kids in the movie,</v>

66
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a boy in that film,</v>

67
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>he had the first of many onscreen fights.</v>

68
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>He was building this and a string of films that followed as Lee sue long or</v>

69
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:43.371
<v Speaker 1>Leila.</v>

70
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.204
<v Speaker 1>So Dragon.</v>

71
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Bruce loved the life of a young actor.</v>

72
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Often he would be picked up.</v>

73
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It's 2:00 AM leaping from his beds and excitedly rushing out the door.</v>

74
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>In his later films,</v>

75
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>he played teenage rebels who invariably ended up in a climactic fight scene.</v>

76
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>From the very start,</v>

77
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>he developed certain trademark mannerisms which would later become famous.</v>

78
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The admonishing finger,</v>

79
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>the thumb wiped across his nose,</v>

80
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>the steady unflinching gaze.</v>

81
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was 18 Bruce had appeared in 20 films,</v>

82
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>the most famous of which was the orphan,</v>

83
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>which was his own leading role.</v>

84
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 12 Bruce began attending lasalle college.</v>

85
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>A Catholic boy's school is teachers that found him to be daisy,</v>

86
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>stubborn and rebellious.</v>

87
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese students of Bruce and school felt a strong rivalry with the British</v>

88
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>students who attended King George the fifth school,</v>

89
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>which was up the hill.</v>

90
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Bruce became the leader of a gang that hung out after school behind the playing</v>

91
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>field of the rival school.</v>

92
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>The boys would shout taunts at the British students.</v>

93
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Often with the results that fee fist fights would break out the rumbles.</v>

94
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They were often broken up by the police.</v>

95
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Phone calls and visits by the police became a regular occurrence of Billy</v>

96
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>

97
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 1>His father was furious at the way,</v>

98
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>would cost that Bruce was taking and imposed strict restrictions on him,</v>

99
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>but he was not home enough for them to have any real effects with fighting</v>

100
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>becoming a major part of his life.</v>

101
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Bruce began thinking about the subjects most of the time.</v>

102
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>He later recalled that he always fought with his gang behind him using chairs as</v>

103
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

104
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.481
<v Speaker 1>but what was happening,</v>

105
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>he wonders if he got caught on his own without his gang to back him up.</v>

106
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Could he protect himself?</v>

107
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>He decided not to take any chances and it became convinced this in order to</v>

108
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>survive,</v>

109
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>he needed to be trained in the most effective of the martial arts.</v>

110
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.633
<v Speaker 1>Kung Fu,</v>

111
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Bruce's father had taught him some Tai Chi moves,</v>

112
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but the slow flowing movements where there's this'll health and a street fight</v>

113
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>at the age of 13 he began learning wing Chung.</v>

114
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm the trainer William Young.</v>

115
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Bruce threw himself into his lessons,</v>

116
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>practicing constantly and making rapid progress.</v>

117
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Young was so impressed with his young students that he introduced him to his</v>

118
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Mazda or revered older man named Yip man.</v>

119
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.820
<v Speaker 1>The master decided to take on Bruce as a personal students.</v>

120
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.541
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>

121
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Bruce was only interested in learning how to street fight,</v>

122
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but as the lessons continued,</v>

123
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.241
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

124
00:04:53.241 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>A man introduced him to the finer points of the OSC meditation,</v>

125
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 1>breathing and balance while training under Yep.</v>

126
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Bruce learns not only to master the physical techniques,</v>

127
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>but also to quell the interference of emotions such as fear and anger.</v>

128
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Despite his developing skills as a martial artist,</v>

129
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Bruce was still a troublemaker at school.</v>

130
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>At Age 15 he was expelled from the South College ending up at in Francis Xavier</v>

131
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.670
<v Speaker 1>College on the other side of town,</v>

132
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>one of his teachers there,</v>

133
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 1>brother Edward's encouraged to Bruce two releases energies by entering the 1958</v>

134
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 1>boxing championships held between his new school and King George the fifth</v>

135
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

136
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Bruce likes the idea and trained vigorously for the upcoming challenge.</v>

137
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.690
<v Speaker 1>When the competition finally took place,</v>

138
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Bruce breezed his way through the preliminary rounds,</v>

139
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>knocking out three opponents in the first rounds.</v>

140
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.900
<v Speaker 1>In the final,</v>

141
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>he faced Gary alums who had held the title for the last three years.</v>

142
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Bruce was able to use the blocking moves he had learned from when Chung to</v>

143
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>negate the power of his opponents.</v>

144
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Then in the third round,</v>

145
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 1>he landed a devastating blow which put alums on the canvas.</v>

146
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Bruce had won the title despite having the prestige of being inner city boxing</v>

147
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>champ.</v>

148
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Bruce continued to get in trouble with his teachers and then the police.</v>

149
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

150
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>his mother suggested that he returns to the country of his birth to claim</v>

151
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>citizenship before he turned 18 at which time it would be too late.</v>

152
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>His father agreed knowing that Bruce is future depended on him getting away from</v>

153
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:14.684
<v Speaker 1>his peers.</v>

154
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.430
<v Speaker 1>On April 15th,</v>

155
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.730
<v Speaker 1>1959 Bruce gathered up his meager belongings and set off for his three week</v>

156
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:25.020
<v Speaker 1>journey across the Pacific.</v>

157
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.981
<v Speaker 1>Before he left,</v>

158
00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:30.690
<v Speaker 1>his mother slept $100 into his pockets and his father gave him a further $15 he</v>

159
00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>was booked onto the ship as a third class passenger,</v>

160
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.720
<v Speaker 1>but spends most of his time in first costs by giving dance lessons to other</v>

161
00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 1>passengers.</v>

162
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.920
<v Speaker 1>On May the 17th he fulfilled his mother's prophecy when she names him returning</v>

163
00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:41.970
<v Speaker 1>to the place of his birth.</v>

164
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.990
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco.</v>

165
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Bruce stayed with a friend of his father making a meager income by giving dance</v>

166
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:47.460
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>

167
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 1>During his first few months in San Francisco,</v>

168
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 1>he met several local karate students who encouraged him to teach Kung Fu,</v>

169
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but Bruce,</v>

170
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.950
<v Speaker 1>he was not yet ready to make that leap.</v>

171
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>A few months after arriving,</v>

172
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.830
<v Speaker 1>he moved into the boarding house,</v>

173
00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>really a chow,</v>

174
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.301
<v Speaker 1>a family,</v>

175
00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:00.721
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

176
00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and deep began to work as a waiter in a restaurant.</v>

177
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 1>He also enrolled in Edison technical high school when Seattle Hells and Asian</v>

178
00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Culture Day,</v>

179
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.880
<v Speaker 1>teachers at the school asked to breeze to give a kung food demonstration in the</v>

180
00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:12.301
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

181
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:14.340
<v Speaker 1>That day was James de Mille format,</v>

182
00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:17.190
<v Speaker 1>US army heavyweight boxing champion scanning the audience,</v>

183
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Notice to mill and invited him up to spar with him.</v>

184
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Do we all thought he could easily take out the slide Chinaman but were surprised</v>

185
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:27.450
<v Speaker 1>to discover that he was unable to lay a finger on Bruce who was able to block</v>

186
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's counter with deadly efficiency.</v>

187
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.900
<v Speaker 1>After the demonstration,</v>

188
00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:32.910
<v Speaker 1>demille asked Bruce to teach him some moves.</v>

189
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Before long,</v>

190
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Bruce had a devoted core of serious students.</v>

191
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Bruce applied himself to his education for the first time,</v>

192
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.320
<v Speaker 1>earning his diploma from Edison tack with high enough grades to be admitted to</v>

193
00:07:43.321 --> 00:07:45.360
<v Speaker 1>the University of Washington in Seattle.</v>

194
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 1>While in college,</v>

195
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.940
<v Speaker 1>he kept up with his Kung Fu training,</v>

196
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 1>but he would not let his teaching come before his own learning.</v>

197
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.460
<v Speaker 1>He would train it for up to 40 hours each week,</v>

198
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>developing new techniques and borrowing from all forms in order to create the</v>

199
00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:59.310
<v Speaker 1>most functional fighting style.</v>

200
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And in October of 1963 22 year old Bruce quit his job at Ruby Charles</v>

201
00:08:03.631 --> 00:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and opened his own training academy,</v>

202
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.070
<v Speaker 1>the Jun Fan Gung Fu institutes.</v>

203
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 1>He lives at the back in a small window to swim.</v>

204
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.580
<v Speaker 1>It was around this time the Bruce awesome as a fellow students at Washington by</v>

205
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:16.080
<v Speaker 1>the name of Linda Emery.</v>

206
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 1>They began dating though Lindsay hit the budding romance from her parents,</v>

207
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 1>the institutes,</v>

208
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.391
<v Speaker 1>it did well.</v>

209
00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 1>And by 1964 Bruce was ready to open up a larger equipment in Oakland,</v>

210
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:25.980
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

211
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.520
<v Speaker 1>He closed the door of the first academy and men told his assistant tacky camera</v>

212
00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:33.480

213
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Before opening the Oakland's Queen,</v>

214
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Bruce attended the international karate tournament in Long Beach where he had</v>

215
00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:40.950
<v Speaker 1>been invited to give a demonstration here.</v>

216
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Speaker 1>He wowed the crowd with his soon to be famous,</v>

217
00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:44.220
<v Speaker 1>one inch punch.</v>

218
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.000
<v Speaker 1>It was here,</v>

219

221
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.910
<v Speaker 1>who would become his number one students.</v>

222
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Bruce gave further demonstrations is soon had a thriving business in Oakland's.</v>

223
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>His was to build up a nest egg and then bring Linda from Seattle where they</v>

224
00:08:58.681 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>would marry,</v>

225
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>but those plans were swept aside.</v>

226
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>When Lindsay Roots of Bruce saying that she was pregnant,</v>

227
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Bruce,</v>

228
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>he was delighted.</v>

229
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Despite the protestations of Linda's family,</v>

230
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>they were married in a small ceremony.</v>

231
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>On August the 17th 1964 Bruce and his new bride moved in with James Lee and his</v>

232
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

233
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>James was a traditionally trained Kung Fu man who was looking for a more</v>

234
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>practically efficient style.</v>

235
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 1>He works with Bruce to build up his Oakland's cal loon.</v>

236
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>They offered their skills to anyone who was seriously interested in learning how</v>

237
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>to fight.</v>

238
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>In early 1965 they traditional Chinese Kung Fu instructor named Wong.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jack man earns the CPAP with teaching Chinese secret fighting arts to</v>

240
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Westerners.</v>

241
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>He was enraged and it's largely to build his own reputation.</v>

242
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>He challenged Bruce to a fight with a wage at the loser would have to close his</v>

243
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>school when long turned up for the fight.</v>

244
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>He half expected Bruce to back down,</v>

245
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but Bruce was hindsons ready for action as surprised.</v>

246
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Wong tried to throw in some last minute rules,</v>

247
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.351
<v Speaker 1>no ige apps,</v>

248
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:51.961
<v Speaker 1>no growing kicks,</v>

249
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

250
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that Bruce rejected them saying,</v>

251
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not standing for any of that.</v>

252
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>You've made the challenge.</v>

253
00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's all out.</v>

254
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>It's no holds barred.</v>

255
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>The match was sloppy.</v>

256
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>After a few week punches longterm to run,</v>

257
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Bruce ran after him and punched him in the back of their heads,</v>

258
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't land a finishing punch.</v>

259
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>One finally gave up and does entourage.</v>

260
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Dragged him off without a word Bruce was not happy with is showing the fight had</v>

261
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 1>been too messy and she had become winded.</v>

262
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 1>It spurs him on to begin an intense regimen of physical training,</v>

263
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>which he would keep up for the rest of us</v>

264
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.033
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Bruce began making personal appearances all over the country.</v>

282
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.321
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

283
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the Green Hornet wasn't such a hit with adult audiences who saw it as too</v>

284
00:11:08.411 --> 00:11:11.140
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic and too much of a copycat of Batman.</v>

285
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.090
<v Speaker 1>After 26 weekly episodes,</v>

286
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.983
<v Speaker 1>it was canceled.</v>

287
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Despite its popularity as Keto Nunu roles popped up for briefs.</v>

288
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.710
<v Speaker 1>He did manage to make a little cash with guest appearances on long street</v>

289
00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>blondie,</v>

291
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.120
<v Speaker 1>the he turned his energies to teaching Kung Fu,</v>

292
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>although he never intended it.</v>

293
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.590
<v Speaker 1>His techniques seem developed into a new fighting school.</v>

294
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.420
<v Speaker 1>He called it [inaudible] Condo,</v>

295

<v Speaker 1>the way of the intercepting fist in February of 1967 and Bruce opened his third</v>

<v Speaker 1>At the suggestion of the Green Hornets assistant producer,</v>

298
00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:46.870
<v Speaker 1>he raised his fees from $22 per month to as much as $50 per hour.</v>

299
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.441
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>

300
00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:51.220
<v Speaker 1>his rates went up to $250 per hour with director Roman Polanski,</v>

303
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Lee Corbin and Kareem Abdul Jabbar.</v>

304
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.270
<v Speaker 1>He also trained established martial art masters including Chuck Norris,</v>

305
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:01.841
<v Speaker 1>Joe Louis,</v>

306
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:02.674
<v Speaker 1>and Mike Stone.</v>

307
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Between them,</v>

308
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>those three had won every major karate championship in the United States.</v>

309
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>On April the 19th 1969 Lindsey gave birth to a daughter Shannon.</v>

310
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.973
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks later.</v>

311
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Bruce suffered a severe back injury while lifting a 125 pound barbell.</v>

312
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 1>The doctor had told him to forget to Kung Fu,</v>

313
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have a kick again for three months.</v>

314
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>He lay flat on his back and fell into a deep depression.</v>

315
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.521
<v Speaker 1>After six months,</v>

316
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>he finally began training again working through his pain in a short amount of</v>

317
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

318
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He was back to his own self.</v>

319
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>It was at the same time the Bruce was working with screenwriters,</v>

320
00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>sterling silver fans and actor Lee Marvin or what was to be his breakout film,</v>

321
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 1>the silent flute.</v>

322
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 1>The film never got to the shooting stage,</v>

323
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:42.880
<v Speaker 1>but cellophane did get Bruce a cameo on the TV series.</v>

324
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.733
<v Speaker 1>Long Street.</v>

325
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after shooting the Long Street episode,</v>

326
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Bruce flew to Hong Kong to arrange for his now widowed mother to come and live</v>

327
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

328
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 1>When he stepped off the plane,</v>

329
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 1>he was shocked at the reaction.</v>

330
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 1>The Green Horn is had been playing in movie theaters and did it made Bruce the</v>

331
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Chinese hero.</v>

332
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>He was bombarded by reporters and spent the next two weeks doing the rounds of</v>

333
00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>the local TV talk shows.</v>

334
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Bruisers fame did not escape the attention of the key players in the Hong Kong</v>

335
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 1>film industry.</v>

336
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 1>The shore brothers,</v>

337
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>they produced two thirds of the Chinese films in the wells vans walls,</v>

338
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 1>a film production assembly line with actors and crew being grossly underpaid.</v>

339
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.130
<v Speaker 1>They offered Bruce a seven year contracts for just $2,000 per film and tighten</v>

340
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>them down.</v>

341
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Then Bruce was approached by Raymond Chow with Golden Harvest Studios who</v>

342
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>offered $15,000 for two movies.</v>

343
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Bruce,</v>

344
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>while he signed on the dotted line and the rest,</v>

345
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.333
<v Speaker 1>as they say,</v>

346
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.173
<v Speaker 1>is history.</v>

347
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Bruce,</v>

348
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 1>his first major role as an adult was in the big boss.</v>

349
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 1>The film was shot in Bangkok in the middle of a heat wave.</v>

350
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>We've no air conditioning,</v>

351
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 1>polluted water and no fresh food.</v>

352
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It was hardly the star's life that Bruce had dreamed of,</v>

353
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but it was all worth it because he was finally on his way.</v>

354
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 1>The big boss Premiers in October of 1971 Bruce and Linda sat in the audience in</v>

355
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 1>nervous anticipation.</v>

356
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 1>The movie ended to complete silence.</v>

357
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Then utter chaos broke out.</v>

358
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 1>The ecstatic crowd practically mobbed as you tried to leave the fares out within</v>

359
00:13:59.171 --> 00:13:59.711
<v Speaker 1>three weeks,</v>

360
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>the film took in more than $3 million in Hong Kong.</v>

361
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Smashing all records.</v>

362
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Bruce's second film for Golden Harvest,</v>

363
00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:07.840
<v Speaker 1>fists of fury was even more popular.</v>

364
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Smashing the record.</v>

365
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Saps by the big boss on the streets,</v>

366
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>sold out tickets went for $50 a pop.</v>

367
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Bruce,</v>

368
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 1>it become a superstar almost overnight.</v>

369
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly he was unable to walk down the street without drawing a crowd,</v>

370
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's adding to the United States.</v>

371
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Bruce was excited about a new TV series that was in production,</v>

372
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>tentatively called for warrior.</v>

373
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 1>It was the story of a Chinese Shaolin monk who gets transplanted in the American</v>

374
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:29.830
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

375
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Bruce desperately wanted the pot,</v>

376
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>yet he was shocked and disappointed to learn that he was considered to Chinese</v>

377
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:35.550
<v Speaker 1>for the role.</v>

378
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 1>You remember him.</v>

379
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to play the role of a Chinese man.</v>

380
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 1>The Bob was actually given to an American accent named David Cara.</v>

381
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Diane Ans retitled Kung Fu briefs dealt with this rejection by throwing himself</v>

382
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 1>into his next project.</v>

383
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>A film.</v>

384
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>He rose by himself,</v>

385
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:49.780
<v Speaker 1>called the way of the Dragon.</v>

386
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>He decided to do this completely by himself.</v>

387
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 1>He would produce direct cost,</v>

388
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 1>choreograph scout locations and star in the movie.</v>

389
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 1>He even played percussion for the movie soundtrack.</v>

390
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>The movie was shot only $130,000 budget on location in Rome.</v>

391
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.550
<v Speaker 1>In the climactic scene,</v>

392
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Bruce recreated a one-on-one gladiatorial contest with Chuck Norris.</v>

393
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Way Of the dragon was a smash hit.</v>

394
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It's taken in five point $5 million in Hong Kong alone in the wake of its</v>

395
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>

396
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Bruce had planned to take some time off to recover from his grueling schedule.</v>

397
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.080
<v Speaker 1>In October of 1972 he has the basketball star,</v>

398
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Kareem Abdul Jabbar was in Hong Kong.</v>

399
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 1>He quickly arranged some action sequences with a seven foot,</v>

400
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 1>two inch form of students that could be used in this next project,</v>

401
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.313
<v Speaker 1>game of death,</v>

402
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:30.981
<v Speaker 1>having shots,</v>

403
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:32.660
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes of footage of the game of death.</v>

404
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Bruce finally got the call from Hollywood that he had been waiting for for so</v>

405
00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

406
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Warner brothers now saw Bruce as a bankable commodity.</v>

407
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>They wanted him to start in a US s martial arts film as we're willing to give</v>

408
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>them complete control over the fight scenes.</v>

409
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.330
<v Speaker 1>The entire feature was called enter the Dragon.</v>

410
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 1>The filming of enter the Dragon placed enormous demands on Bruce's physical</v>

411
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

412
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't sleep at night.</v>

413
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>He lost weight and to skin pales and he started to look ill.</v>

414
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.140
<v Speaker 1>We're filming wraps up Bruce Sands and a tiny dubbing room on May the 10th 1973</v>

415
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 1>looping dialogue in order to achieve complete silence.</v>

416
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 1>The air conditioning was shutoff.</v>

417
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Bruce went to the bathroom to wash his face and collapsed.</v>

418
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 1>He was seized with a fit of vomiting and struggled to breathe.</v>
