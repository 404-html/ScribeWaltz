1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>We live in a world of overuse type,</v>

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>tentatively still,</v>

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to overstate the phenomenon that is youtube and just over a decade,</v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:12.561
<v Speaker 1>it has risen from nothing to 70 billion hours of video watched every month.</v>

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It is also the third most visited site on the Internet with 80 percent of</v>

6
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>viewers coming from outside the United States.</v>

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>It has more than one point 5 billion monthly users who are entertained by 400</v>

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>hours worth of video,</v>

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>uploaded every 60 seconds and on top of all of that,</v>

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>it's made a lot of people a lot of money,</v>

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>but have you ever stopped and wondered how Youtube came about?</v>

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story and today you're going to discover it all as we go</v>

13
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes to bring you the real youtube story</v>

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>said with a chance encounter in 1999,</v>

15
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:53.861
<v Speaker 1>Eric Skaggs,</v>

16
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>a local entrepreneur,</v>

17
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>was finishing up some work on his website at the College of Business Computer</v>

18
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Lab at Indiana University in Pennsylvania.</v>

19
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>His website was called,</v>

20
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>go get it now.</v>

21
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Josh carbon was an amalgamation of email search engine and web hosting combined</v>

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>into a single interface as he was about to leave the building.</v>

23
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Scag saw a tall guy and a baseball cap coming in.</v>

24
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>They struck up a conversation and skaggs learned that this guy was Chad Hurley.</v>

25
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>He was a graphics arts may job who was looking for an idea for a website.</v>

26
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The idea that skaggs gave to honey wants to provide to the inspiration for the</v>

27
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>youtube revolution.</v>

28
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>He told him that in the future,</v>

29
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>television and computers would become fully integrated.</v>

30
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.251
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

31
00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>people would be able to use their cell phones to create home videos and they</v>

32
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 1>would want a platform to share them with friends and family.</v>

33
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

34
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>this was all at a time when there were no cameras in phones and TV and the</v>

35
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Internet were very different animals.</v>

36
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.111
<v Speaker 1>The idea of,</v>

37
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:47.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>it was a little overwhelming for her,</v>

39
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>the and distorted away for future reference.</v>

40
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>After graduating from Indiana University with a finance degree,</v>

41
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>these started looking for employment in the exciting new internet industry.</v>

42
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.700
<v Speaker 1>He picked up a wired magazine from his local grocery store,</v>

43
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>which featured the top 10 internet companies.</v>

44
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Holly sat down and redesigns those companies' logos,</v>

45
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>sending them to the marketing departments of the respective companies,</v>

46
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>the one he did for a company that you might have heard of paper or caught the</v>

47
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>eye of co founder Elon Musk,</v>

48
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 1>and before he knew as Hurley was hired as the company's first graphic designer,</v>

49
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>it was a paypal that holly was able to pick the brains of the most brilliant</v>

50
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 1>techie neds in the industry.</v>

51
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.310
<v Speaker 1>The two smartest guys in the room where Steve Chen and corrine Shannon was born</v>

52
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>in Taiwan in 1978 with this family moving to the United States when he was eight</v>

53
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

54
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 1>he had attended the Illinois Mathematics and science academy where he proved to</v>

55
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 1>be a math prodigy.</v>

56
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 1>His passion was computer engineering and he went on to study computer science at</v>

57
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 1>the University of Illinois.</v>

58
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>He began working for paypal in 1999.</v>

59
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>A few months before holly had was born in Germany in 1979.</v>

60
00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Moving with his family to the US when he was 13,</v>

61
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>from the stance,</v>

62
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Joanne was a computer whiz in school.</v>

63
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>He wrote computer programs,</v>

64
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>posting them on the Internet for free.</v>

65
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>It also helps to set up the school's email system,</v>

66
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>just like Steve Chen.</v>

67
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Karen went to the University of Illinois where he studied computer science after</v>

68
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>a number of internships with a range of technology companies.</v>

69
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>He sought employment with paypal in the year 2000 where he was put to work on</v>

70
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 1>designing the company's anti fraud security system early.</v>

71
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>The graphic designer Chen,</v>

72
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the engineer and Korean.</v>

73
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>The systems go real soon,</v>

74
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.250
<v Speaker 1>found each other and spends more and more time brainstorming ideas for their own</v>

75
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>startup.</v>

76
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>For five years,</v>

77
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>they kicked around ideas while building up that knowledge and experience a</v>

78
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>paypal.</v>

79
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Then in January of 2005,</v>

80
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>he was hosting a dinner party at his home.</v>

81
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Jen was in attendance and he began using a camcorder to take some video of the</v>

82
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.044
<v Speaker 1>festivities.</v>

83
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>The next day they wanted to share the video with those who had been in</v>

84
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>attendance.</v>

85
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>The problem was that the video files were way too big to send diver email,</v>

86
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and even though there were a few photo sharing websites such as flicker and</v>

87
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>shutterfly,</v>

88
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>nothing existed for the sharing of video online.</v>

89
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that the seed that had been planted years before came to</v>

90
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>life teaming up with Korean.</v>

91
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 1>They decided to create a website to share videos.</v>

92
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>The idea was to use the video sharing platform to create a dating site.</v>

93
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>People would post videos of themselves and they could view these and respond if</v>

94
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>they liked what they saw.</v>

95
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>They called it tune in hookup.</v>

96
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.610
<v Speaker 1>They launched this site within days and then waited for the users to come are</v>

97
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

98
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens in an attempt to get some content up on the site.</v>

99
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>They placed ads on craigslist offering to pay people to post videos.</v>

100
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Still no one was interested and tune in hookup became a huge flop.</v>

101
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>The trio,</v>

102
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>they were disheartened,</v>

103
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's not dismayed.</v>

104
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after the demise of their first joint venture,</v>

105
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Joanne was frustratingly searching online for a video of Janet Jackson's</v>

106
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.460
<v Speaker 1>infamous 2004 superbowl halftime show wardrobe malfunction because there was no</v>

107
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>user friendly platform for sharing video content.</v>

108
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't able to satisfy his breast fetish together with Harley and Chen.</v>

109
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>He designed it to do something about it,</v>

110
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>stripping away the Lane Dayton concepts if they were left with a video uploading</v>

111
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and sharing platform,</v>

112
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>or they needed now was a name for that website</v>

113
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>on February the 14th,</v>

114
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>2005,</v>

115
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>and a humble apartment above a California pizza shop.</v>

116
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>The trio began building their new website initially,</v>

117
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>the apparently in reference to Janet Jackson's unwitting contribution that they</v>

118
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>wanted to call it a boob tube,</v>

119
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>realizing that that sounded too much like a porn site that they began playing</v>

120
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>around with words that conveyed the idea of personalized television.</v>

121
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Harking back to the days when the TV was called the tube,</v>

122
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the Catholic rate,</v>

123
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>you've that powered is one of the three.</v>

124
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>No one knows which one came up with youtube.</v>

125
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It sounded perfect.</v>

126
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>They were short,</v>

127
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>catchy,</v>

128
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>

129
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>and it perfectly summed up what they were about.</v>

130
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>When early applies to register the domain name,</v>

131
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>the idea was to go with youtube with a view instead of y o u,</v>

132
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>however that domain was already taken,</v>

133
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>which forced him to proceed a tube,</v>

134
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>but with the three letter word,</v>

135
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you hurley each and immediately set about writing down the goals for at the top</v>

136
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>of that list was ease of user experience loading and to watching videos had to</v>

137
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>be super easy so that even the most computer illiterate person could do it.</v>

138
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>They've been divided up the workload.</v>

139
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Chad Hailey was in charge of the look and design of the site is well.</v>

140
00:06:11.341 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>There's tagging and labeling uploaded videos to make them easier for viewers to</v>

141
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

142
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.531
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

143
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Jen was the engineered.</v>

144
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>He made sure that the site was running smoothly and that video's played without</v>

145
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:20.961
<v Speaker 1>lagging to read.</v>

146
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:21.291
<v Speaker 1>Korean.</v>

147
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile uses programming skills to get the site up and running and looking</v>

148
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

149
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the other two,</v>

150
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Korean chose not to be an employee of the company.</v>

151
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

152
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.380
<v Speaker 1>his role is that of an informal advisor.</v>

153
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>This allowed him to focus on the graduate studies and computer science at</v>

154
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Stanford University.</v>

155
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>The first video ever uploaded onto youtube was an 18 seconds long of Korean,</v>

156
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>but the San Diego Zoo entitled me at the zoo.</v>

157
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>You can still watch this historic clip on the site where it has been seen by</v>

158
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>more than 30 million people.</v>

159
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Holly,</v>

160
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>he was put in charge of marketing.</v>

161
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>He started a competition where different youtube used though was given an Ipod</v>

162
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Nano every day for eight weeks.</v>

163
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>People aren't points by referring a friend or posting a video.</v>

164
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>The more points you gains,</v>

165
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the greater your chances of winning the ipod.</v>

166
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>The promotion works and people began to flooding the site with video concepts.</v>

167
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

168
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>this it created a problem.</v>

169
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>So much content was coming on board that youtube was running out of bandwidth.</v>

170
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>This made video playback,</v>

171
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>excrutiatingly slaves.</v>

172
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>They were desperately in need of more storage capacity which required money,</v>

173
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 1>but as of yet so they weren't making any.</v>

174
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately on the basis of future ad revenue forecasts,</v>

175
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>they were able to secure a three point $5,000,000 venture capital loan in</v>

176
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.170
<v Speaker 1>November of 2005 just a month earlier.</v>

177
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>A nice promotional video featuring Brazilian football star Renelle denia became</v>

178
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 1>the first youtube clips or reach 1 million views</v>

179
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>by the beginning of 2006 youtube grains and more than 60 employees and the site</v>

180
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>had more than 100 million views.</v>

181
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>This was an astounding level of growth considering that just 12 months earlier,</v>

182
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>they literally couldn't pay people to post videos on their website.</v>

183
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Over the course of its first year.</v>

184
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>The nature of the content is being loaded onto youtube.</v>

185
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>It evolved for the first few months.</v>

186
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>The majority of clips were of the home movie variety,</v>

187
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but then more and more how to videos began appearing with advice being offered</v>

188
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>on how to do everything from changing the oil in your car,</v>

189
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 1>do the proper technique for doing a barbell squat.</v>

190
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

191
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>youtube was fast becoming the goatee source for both entertainment and</v>

192
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.094
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

193
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.551
<v Speaker 1>In June,</v>

194
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:23.361
<v Speaker 1>2006,</v>

195
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>youtube ends to contract with NBC television.</v>

196
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Say you turned by NBC.</v>

197
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>He would previously forced you to.</v>

198
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>You have to remove the Saturday night live clip after it became viral online.</v>

199
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.681
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

200
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>NBC agreed to pay you to you,</v>

201
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but to place promotional clips of their shares.</v>

202
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>These were things such as behind the scenes,</v>

203
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>interviews and other features.</v>

204
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Youtube was by now we're attracting the attention of the biggest players in the</v>

205
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:49.264
<v Speaker 1>web universe.</v>

206
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.910
<v Speaker 1>The site was wildly popular with viral videos,</v>

207
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:53.350
<v Speaker 1>regularly appearing on TV,</v>

208
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:54.340
<v Speaker 1>news broadcasts,</v>

209
00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>and even entire being devoted to youtube content.</v>

210
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>The sort of global reach that Youtube had acquired was extremely inviting to the</v>

211
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>biggest player of them all.</v>

212
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>In October of 2006,</v>

213
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:07.750
<v Speaker 1>the Google Corporation purchased you to you for a staggering,</v>

214
00:09:07.751 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 1>at one point six,</v>

215
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 1>$5 billion dollars.</v>

216
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>The three tech notes from paypal now have more money than they could possibly</v>

217
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:15.430
<v Speaker 1>spend an entire lifetime.</v>

218
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Just like being independently wealthy beyond measure early,</v>

219
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>and Jen stayed with Youtube.</v>

220
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

221
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 1>they were thrilled to be working with central web giants as Google.</v>

222
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 1>They now had the freedom to focus on adding new technology to the website in an</v>

223
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>effort to encourage people to stay on the site for longer.</v>

224
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>They added extra features including suggestions of follow up videos that the</v>

225
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>viewer might be interested in watching.</v>

226
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>They also set to work on making the youtube experience available through a</v>

227
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>greater range of devices.</v>

228
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.121
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is mobile.</v>

229
00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:45.550
<v Speaker 1>App lets people watch videos on their cell phones and people could now add a</v>

230
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.231
<v Speaker 1>youtube clips,</v>

231
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 1>do that websites and their blogs.</v>

232
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>It'll move.</v>

233
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It emphasized just how dominant youtube was in people's lives.</v>

234
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Time magazine featured a youtube screen on the cover of it's 2006 person of the</v>

235
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.791
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

236
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:57.624
<v Speaker 1>issue</v>

237
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.581
<v Speaker 1>in May,</v>

238
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>2007,</v>

239
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:04.310
<v Speaker 1>but partner program that was launched.</v>

240
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.050
<v Speaker 1>This allowed people who uploaded videos to have a share in the ad revenue</v>

241
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.240
<v Speaker 1>generated by the advertising that was played during their video.</v>

242
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Now for the first time,</v>

243
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.100
<v Speaker 1>everyday people were able to tend their hobbies into successful online</v>

244
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:16.934
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

245
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.160
<v Speaker 1>The program which is still in operation today,</v>

246
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>pays uploaders around 55 percent of the ad revenue over the last decades.</v>

247
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.380
<v Speaker 1>This revenue source has paid off big time for a relatively small number of</v>

248
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 1>creators who are known as Youtube,</v>

249
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.930
<v Speaker 1>as people have created massive followings and huge annual earnings.</v>

250
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They've also been able to leverage their popularity to obtain sponsorship deals</v>

251
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>with merchandisers who are keen to get their products in the videos.</v>

252
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Some of these youtubers have even landed movie and TV roles.</v>

253
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.070
<v Speaker 1>As a result of that online fame,</v>

254
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.490
<v Speaker 1>2007 was also the year that youtube began impacting politics.</v>

255
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Seven of the 13 candidates for the presidency of the United States announced</v>

256
00:10:58.631 --> 00:11:00.430
<v Speaker 1>their campaigns through youtube.</v>

257
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.030
<v Speaker 1>This was followed by the first youtube presidential debates which featured</v>

258
00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:05.740
<v Speaker 1>questions submitted by viewers.</v>

259
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Then in 2009,</v>

260
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:11.260
<v Speaker 1>the capability was introduced to to upload and watch three d videos on youtube.</v>

261
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:11.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

262
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:12.100
<v Speaker 1>that same year,</v>

263
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.670
<v Speaker 1>these staggering milestone of 1 billion views per day was reached.</v>

264
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Less than three years later,</v>

265
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.730
<v Speaker 1>that number had mushroomed to 4 billion.</v>

266
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.160
<v Speaker 1>The first video to reach 1 billion views once the unforgettable gangnam style by</v>

267
00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 1>psy,</v>

268
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.440
<v Speaker 1>which reached the milestone on December the 21st 2012 in 2011.</v>

269
00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:31.450
<v Speaker 1>The new feature of live streaming was added.</v>

270
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:31.781
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

271
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:35.590
<v Speaker 1>major world events can be watched in real time making youtube a viable</v>

272
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 1>alternative to the television Sas because youtube was soon to prove that it was</v>

273
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:42.610
<v Speaker 1>more than just a recorder of historical events.</v>

274
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.750
<v Speaker 1>January the 25th,</v>

275
00:11:43.751 --> 00:11:48.670
<v Speaker 1>2011 was a day of protest against the government of President Mubarak in Cairo,</v>

276
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

277
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Throughout that day,</v>

278
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.080
<v Speaker 1>video of the proclaimed a day of rage began appearing on this inspired and</v>

279
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>emboldened thousands of Egyptian citizens who came pouring out into the streets.</v>

280
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>The protests went on for 18 days and the protesters were able to use youtube</v>

281
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>along with facebook and twitter to galvanize the support that would eventually</v>

282
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 1>lead to change.</v>

283
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Uber x regime reacted to the skillful use of the Internet on the positive it's</v>

284
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.700
<v Speaker 1>detractors by imposing a sweeping crackdown of the Internet.</v>

285
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>This only further enraged the protesters eventually forcing move or act to step</v>

286
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:24.901
<v Speaker 1>down and democratic elections to be held for the first time in decades in 2011,</v>

287
00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 1>there was also a major overhaul of the websites.</v>

288
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

289
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 1>the video channels were displayed in a central column and the Youtube logo was</v>

290
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 1>updated.</v>

291
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>The Google chrome browser was also integrated so that viewers could watch</v>

292
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 1>youtube at directly through Google.</v>

293
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Plus two years after that,</v>

294
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 1>youtube began offering paid subscriptions for a monthly feed.</v>

295
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>This service allowed subscribers do you watch longer ad free videos as well as</v>

296
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:46.924
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

297
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>so one of the founders of youtube up to now,</v>

298
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>well in October of 2010,</v>

299
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Chad Hurley steps down the CEO of youtube handing over the reigns to Salonica</v>

300
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Monga he committed to staying on as an advisor to the company.</v>

301
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Steve Chen left the company.</v>

302
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's about the same time and the teeth again,</v>

303
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>working together on a new venture,</v>

304
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 1>a systems.</v>

305
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Their headline product was an iphone app called a mixed base,</v>

306
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.100
<v Speaker 1>which allows users to shoot,</v>

307
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>edit,</v>

308
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 1>and share video clips.</v>

309
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Avl Systems has acquired a number of other companies,</v>

310
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.230
<v Speaker 1>including delicious and tap 11 chantelle.</v>

311
00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>It was also a major sponsor of the USF one formula one racing team.</v>

312
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.390
<v Speaker 1>He is also a part owner of the NBA team,</v>

313
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the Golden State Warriors,</v>

314
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and the mls,</v>

315
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles football club.</v>

316
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 1>In 2014,</v>

317
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 1>after 15 years of collaboration,</v>

318
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Chen and Harley parted company jobs took over full control of mixed base while</v>

319
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Chen went over to Google ventures as an entrepreneur in residence,</v>

320
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>making it clear that there was no animosity in the passing.</v>

321
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Chen explains actually it was a very personal and difficult decision to make,</v>

322
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 1>but with the decisions as an Avon to mix this,</v>

323
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it became pretty clear mixed.</v>

324
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>It was chance idea before we started Davis and even at Youtube and if I feel</v>

325
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>driven to work on other projects,</v>

326
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 1>then I'm just getting in the way of mixed bit and the team and corrine completed</v>

327
00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>his graduate studies at the University of Illinois in emerging with a master's</v>

328
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>degree in computer science.</v>

329
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Of the three founders.</v>

330
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 1>He received the lowest portion of stock.</v>

331
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

332
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 1>this was still enough for him to around $64,000,000 from the sale to Google in</v>

333
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>2018 launch to university ventures,</v>

334
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:15.460
<v Speaker 1>which provides mentorship,</v>

335
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>expertise and contacts for college students who wants to take innovative</v>

336
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 1>projects to the next level.</v>

337
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Grimm was also one of the first investors in Airbnb in 2009 towards the end of</v>

338
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>2013 crim hit the headlines when he objected along with many other youtube users</v>

339
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>to Google's requirements that commenting on youtube videos only be done through</v>

340
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:35.000
<v Speaker 1>a google plus account.</v>

341
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 1>He showed his displeasure by changing the description on his iconic near the zoo</v>

342
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>video to read.</v>

343
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I cannot comment here anymore since I don't want a google plus account.</v>

344
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>As a result of Karen stance backs up by a 240,000 signature petition,</v>

345
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Google dropped its requirements that commenters must use their google plus</v>

346
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.533
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

347
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It is truly mind blowing to contemplate just how big youtube will become the</v>

348
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 1>next few years.</v>

349
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 1>New Features are constantly being rolled out to enhance the viewer experience</v>

350
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>has already replaced tv as the main source of entertainment information from any</v>

351
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

352
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>According to Google executive chairman,</v>

353
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Eric Schmidt,</v>

354
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>the exponential growth of youtube will bring it six or 7 billion unique visitors</v>

355
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.273
<v Speaker 1>per month.</v>

356
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>With that growth largely being driven from the developing world,</v>

357
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Youtube has become a launching pad for a growing number of breakout stars</v>

358
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 1>including Justin Bieber and Grayson chance.</v>

359
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 1>There have even been a number of TV shows that began life as youtube skits,</v>

360
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 1>including broad city and workaholics.</v>

361
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Youtube is the most public place in the world,</v>

362
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>accessible from the privacy of our own bedrooms.</v>

363
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>It has created unprecedented opportunities for learning,</v>

364
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 1>entertaining,</v>

365
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and earning a living,</v>

366
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but just like anything,</v>

367
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

368
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 1>it can be abused.</v>

369
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.311
<v Speaker 1>For one thing,</v>

370
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it can be mind numbingly addictive.</v>

371
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 1>You might sit down to watch a three minute clip him three hours later.</v>

372
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>You're still slouched in front of the computer watching cats playing piano or</v>

373
