1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to start today's video with a question we'll history rate George W dot</v>

2
00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Bush as the worst president ever,</v>

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>at least half of Americans thought so a decade ago during his presidency,</v>

4
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>his approval ratings absolutely sought after the worst terrorist attack ever on</v>

5
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>American soil.</v>

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Then they bottomed out near the end of his term as the conflict in the Middle</v>

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>

8
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>trudged on a president's son with all of the privilege and the welds.</v>

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Speaker 1>He was a party boy in his youth and he was never expected to go into politics.</v>

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>So what made him follow in his father's footsteps and well,</v>

11
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>what is the uptake today?</v>

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So in the video today,</v>

13
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:38.551
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna dive into the life of America's 43rd President George W Bush.</v>

14
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>George Walker Bush was the first of six children born to you,</v>

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.391
<v Speaker 1>George H,</v>

16
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>w Bush,</v>

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>and Barbara Pierce Bush on July the sixth,</v>

18
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:04.041
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

19
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>46 in new haven,</v>

20
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.621
<v Speaker 1>The Busch family,</v>

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>they were well off.</v>

23
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Speaker 1>There's was a prominent northeastern banking family and later a political dennis</v>

24
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>state at the time of bushes birth.</v>

25
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:14.601
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>

26
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>George senior was an undergraduate students at Yale University.</v>

27
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Immediately after graduating in 1948,</v>

28
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>George senior broke with family tradition and to move to as young families or</v>

29
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>the boom towns of west Texas to try his luck in oil bus,</v>

30
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but that first apartment in Odessa,</v>

31
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>the bushes at to share a bathroom with neighboring prostitutes.</v>

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.230
<v Speaker 1>In 1950 though the family settled in Midland,</v>

33
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Texas once referred to as the headquarters of the independent doyle man at the</v>

34
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

35
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>215 oil companies had offices that Bush senior would eventually earn a fortune</v>

36
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>in the oil business,</v>

37
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>making millions.</v>

38
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was only 40 years old,</v>

39
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 1>the first family home in Midlands was in a development nicknamed Easter egg row</v>

40
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:58.220
<v Speaker 1>for its tiny colorful houses.</v>

41
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>As the Bush family grew,</v>

42
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

43
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>they needed more space,</v>

44
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>so they moved to a larger home on Ohio Avenue in 1951.</v>

45
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Georgie as he was often calls,</v>

46
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>was only five years old at the time.</v>

47
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

48
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>bushes,</v>

49
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Charles or time is listed on the national register of historic places and it's</v>

50
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>open to the public six days a week.</v>

51
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Bush enjoyed an idyllic baby boom of childhood.</v>

52
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Growing up in West Texas,</v>

53
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>the neighborhood,</v>

54
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.431
<v Speaker 1>it was safe.</v>

55
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It was full of a young families.</v>

56
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>He played baseball idolizing the Great Willie mays and developed friendships</v>

57
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>that remained throughout his entire life.</v>

58
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>The Sam Houston elementary school.</v>

59
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>It was not far from his house.</v>

60
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>In 1953,</v>

61
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>though tragedy struck the busch family were in three year old pauline robin was</v>

62
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed with a strange disease.</v>

63
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Neither Barbara rolled George senior had heard of before and that disease was</v>

64
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:45.944
<v Speaker 1>leukemia.</v>

65
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Despite their best efforts taking how far from home for treatments in New York</v>

66
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,</v>

67
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Robin died just seven months after her diagnosis.</v>

68
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>George Jr was seven and did not known his sister's grave condition.</v>

69
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>After a death,</v>

70
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>his parents picked him up from school in the big green oldsmobile.</v>

71
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>He recalled years later being positive that he saw his sister in the backseat</v>

72
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>upon seeing how he was excited and he ran up to the car to see her.</v>

73
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>When his parents broke the news,</v>

74
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>he understood that she was gone and it changed their lives forever.</v>

75
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Some say the loss of Robin was the impetus for the deep bonds that George Jr</v>

76
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>runs Barbara Forms.</v>

77
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>They both spent a great deal of time together after her death.</v>

78
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Eventually the busch family added three more children to the clan,</v>

79
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>including Neil in 1955,</v>

80
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Marvin in 1956 and another daughter Dorothy in 1959.</v>

81
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>That same year with George senior success in the oil business.</v>

82
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.630
<v Speaker 1>The bushes relocated to Houston</v>

83
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>in 1960.</v>

84
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>The 14 year old Bush was sent away to attend the exclusive all boys boarding</v>

85
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

86
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Phillips Academy in Andover,</v>

87
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>

88
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>He lived in the shadow of his more successful luminous father for a fun loving</v>

90
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>tax and Phillips.</v>

91
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>It was a drastic change.</v>

92
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>The curriculum was rigorous.</v>

93
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>The environments was ultra structured and it was cold Bush.</v>

94
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty envious of his buddies back.</v>

95
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

96
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>they were able to do things like take their girlfriends house on a Friday night</v>

97
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>date,</v>

98
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>so with no social life to speak of Bush,</v>

99
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>he played sports instead.</v>

100
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Now academics,</v>

101
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>they did not come easily for Bush.</v>

102
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>He received a zero on his first race and assignments and not wanting to fail.</v>

103
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Bush spent many nights Phillips Academy after curfew,</v>

104
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>studying by the light that seeped under his door.</v>

105
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>He developed a love of American history during his high school years and said</v>

106
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>later that he would bloom where he was planted in his adult life.</v>

107
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Bush acknowledged receiving a first rate education at Philips in 1964 when it</v>

108
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>was time to go off to college.</v>

109
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Bush chose his fathers and his grandfather's Alma Mater,</v>

110
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Yale University.</v>

111
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>During his freshman year,</v>

112
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>his father decided to run for Texas senates and called upon his son for help.</v>

113
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Bush Jr worked on the campaign doing what he could from Connecticut's the elder</v>

114
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

115
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>he lost the campaign,</v>

117
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>but it did prove to be a valuable first time learning experience for George Jr.</v>

118
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>While at yale bush had a bit of a reputation for being a good time skype.</v>

119
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>He excelled socially like he alWays has,</v>

120
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and he's struggled with his studies.</v>

121
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>He was a c students.</v>

122
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>He also wanted to play baseball,</v>

123
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>but quicklY found out that rugby actually suited him Better.</v>

124
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>He played the position of fullback in his first year,</v>

125
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>bush joins the fraternity,</v>

126
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.730
<v Speaker 1>delta kappa epsilon or d,</v>

127
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>k e,</v>

128
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and eventually he became president.</v>

129
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It was in his junior year that he was tapped for introduction into yale's</v>

130
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>premier secret society,</v>

131
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>skull and bones.</v>

132
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>He was the third bush together with his father and his grandfather to be</v>

133
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.753
<v Speaker 1>indicted.</v>

134
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

135
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories have attempted to link this secret group to the cia,</v>

136
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the illuminati,</v>

137
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>even the nazis,</v>

138
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 1>and even to this day,</v>

139
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:50.891
<v Speaker 1>bush himself,</v>

140
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>he remains tight lipped about his involvement as a bondsman.</v>

141
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.371
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

142
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:58.820

152
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.531
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

153
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:34.750
<v Speaker 1>during this presidential campaign in 2004,</v>

161
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>bush never flew in the air national guard.</v>

162
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.250
<v Speaker 1>After april of 1972,</v>

163
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>his pilot's license had been revoked for failure to undergo the mandatory</v>

164
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:05.380
<v Speaker 1>physical examination.</v>

165
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.370
<v Speaker 1>In 1972,</v>

166
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:07.660
<v Speaker 1>busH was living in montgomery,</v>

168
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.661
<v Speaker 1>while in Alabama,</v>

169
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:17.380
<v Speaker 1>he drilled with you 187 fighter wing of the national guard.</v>

170
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Bush was honorably discharged on november the 21st 1974.</v>

171
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Now in 1973,</v>

172
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:28.000
<v Speaker 1>bush entered harvard business school and graduated with an mba in 1975.</v>

173
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Then soon after,</v>

174
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>in 1977,</v>

175
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.220
<v Speaker 1>he began his industry career in Texas oil,</v>

176
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.390
<v Speaker 1>establishing our bus do energy with a number of other private investors.</v>

177
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Operations began the following year in 1978.</v>

178
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.571
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

179
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:44.730
<v Speaker 1>bush was not as successful in the oil business and his father and he sold our</v>

180
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.080
<v Speaker 1>bas do in 1984 to spectrum seven,</v>

181
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.570
<v Speaker 1>another Texas gas exploration fan.</v>

182
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.780
<v Speaker 1>He remains the ceo of this business under the terms of the sale in 1986 spectrum</v>

183
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 1>seven merged with hok and energy corporation where bush held a seat on the board</v>

184
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>of directors and retains an annual consulting contract.</v>

185
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Then sometime later in 1988,</v>

186
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 1>which was working on his father's bit to become the next president of the United</v>

187
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

188
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that he learned his father's friends and fellow oil man at</v>

189
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 1>each child's was selling the Texas rangers baseball franchise.</v>

190
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Not wanting to see this opportunity slip by bush organized a syndicate to</v>

191
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:22.180
<v Speaker 1>punches a controlling interest in the team.</v>

192
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 1>As a report it $89,000,000.</v>

193
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Bush became the general manager of this team even though his initial investment</v>

194
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 1>was only half a million dollars.</v>

195
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

196
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 1>bush even took out a loan to pay for his shaft.</v>

197
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It was in 1990 that bush sold is hawkin stock to pay the balance of the loan off</v>

198
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>that had taken out to purchase the ranges two months after the south.</v>

199
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:40.150
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

200
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>harkened released its quarterly numbers showing a larger than expected loss.</v>

201
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>

202
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>insider trading allegations erupted and the sale of bushes stock was</v>

203
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:53.890
<v Speaker 1>investigated by the us securities and exchange commission who ultimately found</v>

204
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.813
<v Speaker 1>no wrong doing.</v>

205
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>In 1977,</v>

206
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.240
<v Speaker 1>bush was invited to a barbecue at his friend's house in Texas.</v>

207
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>The only other guests was a woman bush had never met,</v>

208
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>even though she was from midland to bush,</v>

209
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>was enamored with the beautiful teacher and librarian,</v>

210
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.941
<v Speaker 1>dora,</v>

211
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:18.271
<v Speaker 1>lane,</v>

212
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>welch,</v>

213
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>and the two fell in love almost instantly.</v>

214
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It was a short while wind romance before they will add three months later on</v>

215
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:25.591
<v Speaker 1>november the fifth,</v>

216
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:25.951
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

217
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 1>77.</v>

218
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>The couple have settled in midlands and in 1981,</v>

219
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>the couple had fraternal twin daughters,</v>

220
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 1>jenna and Barbara Bush credits his wife laura,</v>

221
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>with bringing his own life into water as a young man.</v>

222
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:39.980
<v Speaker 1>He was aimless with periods of unemployment.</v>

223
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 1>He drank too much and he really enjoyed going out as he refers to you as his</v>

224
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 1>nomadic periods.</v>

225
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>One embarrassing episode came back to Haunt him years later on the campaign</v>

226
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>trail in 2000 or the age of 30 while on vacation in Maine at the family's summer</v>

227
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>residence.</v>

228
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>He was arrested for drunk driving,</v>

229
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 1>which kept them out of private until the story broke in the news media.</v>

230
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.053
<v Speaker 1>When asked about it,</v>

231
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.893
<v Speaker 1>he responded.</v>

232
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I often times said that years ago I made some mistakes.</v>

233
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I occasionally drank too mucH and his ideas on that night.</v>

234
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I regret that it happens,</v>

235
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.103
<v Speaker 1>but it did.</v>

236
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.063
<v Speaker 1>I've learned my lesson.</v>

237
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 1>So after his marriage do Laura Bush,</v>

238
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>he joins the united methodist church and became a born again christian.</v>

239
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.420
<v Speaker 1>The day after his 40th birthday on july the sixth,</v>

240
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.731
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

241
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>86,</v>

242
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>bush gave up drinking alcohol for good</v>

243
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.830
<v Speaker 1>bush decided to run for the governor of Texas as a republican after his father</v>

244
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>failed to win the presidential reelection in 1992 as manager for the Texas</v>

245
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 1>rangers,</v>

246
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 1>bush had earned a reputation as a savvy businessman and so he was well liked in</v>

247
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:47.821
<v Speaker 1>his home.</v>

248
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>State,</v>

249
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 1>has campaigned against the democrats on richard's focused on welfare and tort</v>

250
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>reform,</v>

251
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>reducing crime and improving education.</v>

252
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.870
<v Speaker 1>The richards camp was sure that bush would make a gaful,</v>

253
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 1>lose his temper on the campaign trail,</v>

254
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.683
<v Speaker 1>but he never did.</v>

255
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a close race and it was a contentious one bush.</v>

256
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Then it will be won the election with 53 percent of the vote and was sworn in as</v>

257
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>the 46th governor of Texas in 1995,</v>

258
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 1>he became the first child of a us president to be elected as a state governor in</v>

259
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:16.800
<v Speaker 1>1998.</v>

260
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>He was reelected with 69 percent of the vote and became the first governor in</v>

261
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Texas history to be elected to serve two consecutive four year terms as governor</v>

262
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>bush was left with a budget surplus which used to push a $2,000,000,000 tax cut</v>

263
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>plan to reduce property taxes and increase funding for education reform.</v>

264
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>The tax cut was the largest in Texas history and to pay for it,</v>

265
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>he saw to the federal government's approval to privatized social services to</v>

266
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:43.401
<v Speaker 1>other nodes.</v>

267
00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Will pieces of legislation is signed into law included the lowering of the age</v>

268
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 1>at which juveniles could be tried as adults in criminal cases and the</v>

269
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>requirements of electric retailers to buy a portion of energy from renewable</v>

270
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>

271
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:55.991
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>

272
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Texas became the largest producer of wind power to electricity in the United</v>

273
00:11:59.920 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

274
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.791
<v Speaker 1>In his second son,</v>

275
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>bush promoted faith based organizations and proclaims june the 10th,</v>

276
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>2000 jesus day in Texas.</v>

277
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>This was a day in which he urged all texans do onto the goal to serve those in</v>

278
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

279
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.041
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

280
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 1>a criticism of his time in office was the fact that under his leadership,</v>

281
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Texas executed 152 prisoners at the time.</v>

282
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It was more than any other taxes governor,</v>

283
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but overall bush had a reputation for working well across the aisle in a non</v>

284
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>confrontational way,</v>

285
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and this earned him a great deal of respect throughout this first time and after</v>

286
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 1>his successful been easy reelection.</v>

287
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Many were speculating whether bush would make a bid for the white house.</v>

288
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.830
<v Speaker 1>On june the 14th of 1999,</v>

289
00:12:49.831 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 1>bush formerly announced his candidacy for the republican presidential</v>

290
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:53.850
<v Speaker 1>nomination.</v>

291
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.880
<v Speaker 1>These stages I'm running because our country must be prosperous,</v>

292
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but prosperity must have a purpose.</v>

293
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>The purpose is of prosperity is to make sure the american dream and touches</v>

294
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>every willing heart.</v>

295
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.440
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of prosperity is to leave no one out to leave,</v>

296
00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:08.310
<v Speaker 1>no one behind.</v>

297
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm running because my party must match a conservative minds with a</v>

298
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:17.541
<v Speaker 1>compassionate heart and I'm running to win during the early parts of the 2000</v>

299
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.170
<v Speaker 1>presidential campaign.</v>

300
00:13:19.171 --> 00:13:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Bush enjoyed a double digit lead in the polls over his opponents and vice</v>

301
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:24.390
<v Speaker 1>president al gore junior.</v>

302
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.640
<v Speaker 1>As the election approached,</v>

303
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.680
<v Speaker 1>the gap narrowed and gore bush won the popular vote by 543,895 votes.</v>

304
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>With the deciding votes hanging on Florida,</v>

305
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.040
<v Speaker 1>the race was determined to be too close to call by major news networks.</v>

306
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:39.290
<v Speaker 1>After first proclaiming gore,</v>

307
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 1>tHe winner,</v>

308
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>the margin was so close that it spurred a recount in some counties.</v>

309
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.140
<v Speaker 1>As lawsuits made their way through the courts,</v>

310
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.200
<v Speaker 1>the final interaction count was bush with 271 and gore with 266 due this day or</v>

311
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:57.330
<v Speaker 1>an e five presidents have lost the popular vote and won the election.</v>

312
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Bush was sworn in as america's 43rd president on january the 20th,</v>

313
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:01.890
<v Speaker 1>2001,</v>

314
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.450
<v Speaker 1>but the second diamond history,</v>

315
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.300
<v Speaker 1>they son of a former president had made it to the white house.</v>

316
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:06.691
<v Speaker 1>The first,</v>

317
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:07.051
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

318
00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:08.280
<v Speaker 1>that was john quincy adams.</v>

319
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:09.480
<v Speaker 1>He was elected in 18,</v>

320
00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:10.140
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>

321
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 1>His father was John Adams,</v>

322
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.230
<v Speaker 1>the second president ever,</v>

323
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.730
<v Speaker 1>but she's new administration.</v>

324
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.550
<v Speaker 1>It was focused on compassionate conservatism.</v>

325
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.770
<v Speaker 1>This embraced excellence in education,</v>

326
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:24.240
<v Speaker 1>tax relief and volunteerism among faith based and community organizations.</v>

327
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.590
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't long before his focus drastically shifted as he was faced with the</v>

328
00:14:28.591 --> 00:14:32.970
<v Speaker 1>greatest challenge of any president since abraham lincoln on the morning of</v>

329
00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:33.930
<v Speaker 1>september the 11th,</v>

330
00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:36.990
<v Speaker 1>2001 19 men trained by al-qaida,</v>

331
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.670
<v Speaker 1>carried out a coordinated attack on the United States hijacking for large</v>

332
00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:45.750
<v Speaker 1>passenger airplanes with the intention of crashing them into major landmarks.</v>

333
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Three of the four planes hit their targets,</v>

334
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.990
<v Speaker 1>the north and south towers,</v>

335
00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 1>the twin towers of the world trade center and the pentagon.</v>

336
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:52.581
<v Speaker 1>In arlington,</v>

337
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

338
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>The fourth plane crashed into a field and rural Pennsylvania in a single day.</v>

339
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 1>These deliberate acts of mass murder kills nearly 3000 people for 100 of which</v>

340
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>were first responders.</v>

341
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.350
<v Speaker 1>As these attacks were happening,</v>

342
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 1>president Bush sat in a classroom at the end of each book at elementary school</v>

343
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>in sarasota county,</v>

344
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Florida with children.</v>

345
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>He was reading the pet goat,</v>

346
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>white house chief of staff,</v>

347
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 1>andrew card whispered in his ear,</v>

348
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 1>informing him a second plane hit the world trade center.</v>

349
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 1>What president bush did next was possibly one of the most controversial</v>

350
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 1>decisions of his presidency.</v>

351
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 1>He stayed in the classroom for seven more minutes following along with the</v>

352
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 1>students reading before excusing himself.</v>

353
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It was brief since gave a short press conference while at the school before</v>

354
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>being taken to a secure location in order to board air force one Michael Moore</v>

355
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>in this film fahrenheit,</v>

356
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.200
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 was highly critical of bushes.</v>

357
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Seven minutes of inaction in the classroom,</v>

358
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 1>more claims that it indicated the bush was indecisive.</v>

359
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

360
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 1>his defenders made the case for keeping the children come,</v>

361
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 1>saying that it was bushes most important duty at the time from the white house.</v>

362
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 1>On the evening of nine slash 11,</v>

363
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.810
<v Speaker 1>he spoke to americans with resolve to fight terrorism and stand together as a</v>

364
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 1>nation.</v>

365
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 1>America and our friends and allies joined with all those who want peace and</v>

366
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 1>security in the world,</v>

367
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and we stand together to win the war against terrorism.</v>

368
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Tonight I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve,</v>

369
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 1>for the children whose words have been shattered for all whose sense of safety</v>

370
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and security has been threatened and I pray they will be comforted by a power</v>

371
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:24.560
<v Speaker 1>greater than any of us spoken through the ages in psalm 23,</v>

372
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>even though I walk through the valley of the shaDow of death,</v>

373
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I fear no evil for you are with me.</v>

374
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 1>In response to the terrorist attacKs of nine slash 11,</v>

375
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.460
<v Speaker 1>bush declared a war on terrorism and formed a new cabinet level department of</v>

376
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.420
<v Speaker 1>homeland security.</v>

377
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 1>These ends american forces into Afghanistan to break up the taliban and</v>

378
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Extremist group under osama bin laden that trains financed and exported</v>

379
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>terrorist teams.</v>

380
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.020
<v Speaker 1>The taliban was disrupted but been laws and was not found until much later</v>

381
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>following the attacks.</v>

382
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.210
<v Speaker 1>President bush also recast the nation's intelligence gathering and analysis</v>

383
00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 1>services and ordered reform of military forces in order to meet a new enemy.</v>

384
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 1>At the same time as doing all of this,</v>

385
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 1>he had other political promises to keep and delivered a major tax cut.</v>

386
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.181
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

387
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:05.511
<v Speaker 1>bushes,</v>

388
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:08.220
<v Speaker 1>most controversial act was the invasion of Iraq.</v>

389
00:17:08.221 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>On the belief that iraqi president,</v>

390
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 1>saddam hussein post a grave threat to the United States by possessing weapons of</v>

391
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 1>mass destruction,</v>

392
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:15.741
<v Speaker 1>the weapons,</v>

393
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:19.780
<v Speaker 1>though they will never found saddam was captured that many american servicemen</v>

394
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and friendlier rocky's lost their lives during the conflict in a state of the</v>

395
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:28.340
<v Speaker 1>union address in 2005 bush plan that the us would help the iraqi people</v>

396
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 1>establish a fully democratic governments bringing hope to the region and lift a</v>

397
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>threat from the lives of future generations.</v>

398
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Bush,</v>

399
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 1>he left office with an abysmal 33 percent approval rating,</v>

400
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but despite this bush political advisor,</v>

401
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 1>carl rove said that bush has an inner confidence that what he did was right</v>

402
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.450
<v Speaker 1>after he left Washington dc.</v>

403
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Bush and hIs wife laura returned to midlands and promptly took up residence at</v>

404
00:18:02.151 --> 00:18:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the priory chapel ranch in crawford,</v>

405
00:18:03.801 --> 00:18:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

406
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Then they also bought a house in dallas and became part of the community.</v>

407
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Unlike some former presidents,</v>

408
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.740
<v Speaker 1>bush seems to enjoy the rest and relaxation of being out of office.</v>

409
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.490
<v Speaker 1>He golfs,</v>

410
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.660
<v Speaker 1>has taken up painting,</v>

411
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.760
<v Speaker 1>attracting national attention at attendance,</v>

412
00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.601
<v Speaker 1>Texas rangers,</v>

413
00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:18.450
<v Speaker 1>baseball games.</v>

414
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.540
<v Speaker 1>He's also heavily involved in the local community.</v>

415
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.361
<v Speaker 1>He occasionally,</v>

416
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:24.260
<v Speaker 1>he gives speeches and was very involved in the George W.</v>

417
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.290
