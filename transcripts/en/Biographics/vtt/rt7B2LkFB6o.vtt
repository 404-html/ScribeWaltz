1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.290
Septin elmo was a writer who created black propaganda on behalf of the British

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.730
government since used fake news to fight the Nazi regime through postcards,

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:11.150
court documents,
and pirate radio programs.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.910
Delmah and the rest of the secret service infiltrated the minds of the German

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:18.570
people using elements of violence,
sex,
and death.
In their stories.

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:23.310
Do you suddenly break down the morale of the Nazis?
So who was Sefton Delmar?

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.750
Why was he most likely the only man on earth who could have become the true

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.090
master of black propaganda?

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.850
Dennis Sefton.
Domo was born in 1904 in Berlin,
Germany as a child.

10
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:48.620
Everyone called him Tom,
but as an adult,

11
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:52.820
everyone remembered him by his parents can joins last names and he was a known

12
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.290
as Sefton Dell Map.
It's father Frederick Sefton.
Delmah taught English ads,

13
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.340
Berlin University.

14
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.670
His parents were both from Australia and they had Jewish heritage.

15
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.450
They registered his birth at the British consulate so that he could be a dual

16
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:08.690
citizen.
He only spoke German before the age of five,

17
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.560
which his parents chose to do on purpose,
hoping he would blend in better.

18
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.290
He grew up to become bilingual in both English and German,

19
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.640
but his parents still raised him to understand his Australian ancestry at home.

20
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.170
At the start of World War One,

21
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:24.560
his father Frederick was removed from his position as a professor at the

22
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.640
university because he was the so called enemy aliens and he was forced to live

23
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.370
in the room of Ben Internment camp growing up in Germany.

24
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.390
The other children in school labeled him as an enemy and he was isolated from

25
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:39.350
his peers and bullied for being different even though they were exactly the
same.

26
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.670
In 1917 Frederick was released from the camp through a prisoner exchange program

27
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.240
between the British and the Germans,
but instead of going back to Australia,

28
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.480
the whole family was deported to England,
so soft and done.

29
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.410
What was able to transfer to a school in London since German was his first

30
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:54.831
language,

31
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:58.960
he couldn't help but speak with accents as far as English classmates working
son,

32
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.720
though he was considered the enemy once again and he was also isolated from the

33
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:05.480
other children in the school.
Even though this must have been difficult,

34
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.030
this life of being stuck in between two worlds,

35
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.870
this is precisely why he was able to understand both cultures so completely

36
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.680
since he was ostracized for the sound of his voice or the words that he used.

37
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.210
It only made him pay more attention to those details and this would all come

38
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.180
rather in handy later on in his adult life.

39
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.860
World War One ended in 1918 when Sefton Delmer was 14 years old.

40
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.340
Despite the fact that he had endured so much bullying in his younger years,

41
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:33.920
he still embraced the fact that he was bilingual.

42
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.640
He runs on to study at Oxford University where he studied German possibly to

43
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:41.390
follow in his father's footsteps of securing a job as a professor.
However,

44
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.790
the never did start a teacher in Korea.

45
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.630
He instead chose to fully embrace the other passion in his life and that was

46
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:51.920
writing and this,
this was just the beginning of his destiny.

47
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.443
<v 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>After graduating Oxford University,</v>

49
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 1>Sefton Delmar got a job for a magazine called the Daily Express.</v>

50
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.600
Since he was bilingual,

51
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.110
he became very valuables in the magazine and translating the news coming out of

52
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.810
Germany in order to make the British public are web.

53
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.320
He was able to become friendly with the Nazi officer Ernst Rom,

54
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.310
who introduced him to add off Hitler in 1932 at this time,

55
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.430
Hitler had just lost his first election and he wouldn't become the chancellor of

56
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.930
Germany until 1933 Sefton download was able to travel with it and are on his

57
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.190
private plane and listened to all of his plans for what he wanted for Germany.

58
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.490
He became the first British journalists do ever secure an interview without off

59
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:38.350
Hitler and he traveled to Berlin to report the day when he took office in 1933

60
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.580
this may seem like a monumental event that should have set him off right then

61
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:43.011
and there,

62
00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:46.930
but at the time no one would have predicted that Hitler would become this evil

63
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.740
dictator.

64
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.250
He was promising to bring Germany out of the financial hardships that did an

65
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.630
injured after World War One and he was even given the title of Man of the year

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.380
in Time magazine.
So as far as the daily express was concerns,

67
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:03.040
there were far more important things going on elsewhere,
but that same year,

68
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.760
the daily express sent him to France to work out of their offices in Paris.

69
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.510
At that time,

70
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.930
Paris was the place to be for some of the most creative people in history.

71
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.770
Some of the most famous writers of that time were living as working there in the

72
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.000
late 1920s to the early 1930s and many of them were actually friends with one

73
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:20.620
another as well.
These writers,

74
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.850
they were the so called lost generation and they indulged heavily in drugs,

75
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.310
sacks and jazz.
While in Paris,

76
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.910
Sefton Delmah met and fell in love with a woman named Isabel Nicholas.

77
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.960
She was a very successful artist,
designer and model.
She was quite beautiful.

78
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.620
Then she became the muse for several famous painters and sculptors,

79
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:42.490
including Public Picasso and a lot of ways they were a perfect match for one

80
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:46.510
another and in 1935 the two were married.
A couple of years later,

81
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.020
Sefton Delmar became a correspondent during the Spanish civil war,

82
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:55.021
which lasted from 1936 to 1939 General Francisco Franco was trying to take over

83
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:59.950
the Spanish government's is on behalf of fascism and both Nazi Germany and Italy

84
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.090
were sending money and ammunition to Franco's Almay.

85
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.840
Stepsons downward became good friends with Hemingway,
who was that?

86
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.780
Writing the scripts and doing the voiceover for a documentary called the Spanish

87
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.800
earth and other items.
Martha Gellhorn was also there for Colliers magazine.

88
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.770
She was one of the only female war correspondence.

89
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.370
She was also willing to put our life in danger to get the scoop on a story.

90
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.660
She would data,
actually Mary Hemingway making her his third wife,

91
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.390
a large group of these writers,
photographers and filmmakers.

92
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.270
They live together in the hotel Florida,
in Madrid,

93
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.050
and they were often singing and drinking in the hotel lobby and Barb,

94
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:38.110
they all believed that by covering the events of the Spanish civil war,

95
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:41.710
they could shed light on the fact that out of Hitler was already pushing his

96
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:45.550
fascist regime on the rest of the world and that the Nazis were an indeed very

97
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.240
dangerous,

98
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.620
but these writers would have no idea that soon enough their own countries would

99
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.860
be at war as well.
Then there was nothing that they could do to stop it

100
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.910
<v 0>all the brink of world war two secret agents and spies were commonplace</v>

101
00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:04.744
throughout Europe.

102
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.380
Her Majesty's secret service was paying close attention to anyone that they

103
00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:12.170
believed could be a Nazi sympathizer,
including Sefton Delmar.

104
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.240
It was like he was living through his elementary school experience all over

105
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:20.440
again because the Germans believed that he was an agent for mic x and they no

106
00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:24.070
longer allowed him to interview at off Hitler or any other high ranking members

107
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:25.030
of the Nazi party.

108
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.450
It was only after he returned to London and started working for the German

109
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:31.990
branch of the BBC that the British government knew that they could actually

110
00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:32.650
trust him.

111
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.820
Sefton Delmar wants described one of adult Hitler speeches is coming from his

112
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.650
lying stinking teeth.

113
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.490
While that's not exactly the most professional thing a journalist could say on

114
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:43.000
the air,

115
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.830
it actually did work out very well for him because in 1940 he was recruited by

116
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:52.831
the political warfare executive branch or the p w e for short and that's sign.

117
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.500
The British secret service was very concerned about a private radio program

118
00:06:56.501 --> 00:07:00.430
called workers challenge,
which was broadcasting from inside of the UK,

119
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:04.720
but it was actually a German propaganda show run by talented actors who spoke

120
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:05.560
fluent English.

121
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.000
They were posing as an antiwar program and they spread fake news to bring down

122
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:11.380
the morale of the British troops,

123
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.890
the British government ostomate and make his own version of a radio show.

124
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:19.480
That was black propaganda.
The goal was to give out roughly 80% real facts,

125
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:23.650
but try to slip in 20% fake news that was meant to subvert the Germans.

126
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.770
He wholeheartedly agreed to do the job that his wife,
Isabelle,

127
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:29.260
was excited to help in whatever way she could.

128
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.620
In 1941 the government gave him a requisitions country house in Bedford show

129
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.520
where he worked together with a team on creating propaganda.

130
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.930
Isabel illustrated fake post scans of German soldiers with French prostitutes.

131
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.950
This was meant to make French men Bengie and jealous and inherently dislike the

132
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:49.480
Nazis.
At that time.
Isabel's illustrations,
they were sexy and suggestive,

133
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:51.490
but they were not exactly pornographic.

134
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:55.930
I mean this was the early 20th century is definitely started a radio broadcast

135
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.480
and so he wrote scripts under the alias of De Chef,

136
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.410
he heart of German immigrants and accent named Paul Saunders to be the voice of

137
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:03.070
the character.

138
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.150
He spoke with a perfect Berlin accidents and they had a strong enough radio

139
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:10.510
tower to make it seem as if the show was being broadcast from Germany.

140
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.620
Does chef claims it to be a loyal Nazi and he was simply giving insider

141
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:16.840
information to inform his fellow comrades.

142
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.500
They used course language and spoke out against the enemies of the Third Reich.

143
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.270
Since Delmar grew up in Germany,

144
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:25.870
he knew how to write these words as if they were truly coming from a German

145
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.770
person and no one would ever know that the show was actually produced by the

146
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:32.410
English sessions.
Elma had a great sense of humanity.

147
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.930
He knew how to capture an audience's attention.

148
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.810
Much of the fake news that he wrote included sexual stories,

149
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:41.530
which was enough to keep the audience listening on a regular basis.
For example,

150
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:44.530
he wants to write that the British were trying to get gem and prisoners of war

151
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:48.580
to give up their secrets by tying them up and torturing them with strippers to

152
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:51.820
chef urged them to be strong and it's not to give into temptation.

153
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.500
Cylinders would have to tell these stories as if he were outraged at the English

154
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.830
saying,
don't give in to these perversions.
Say Nothing.

155
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.330
Then once you had their attention,

156
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.080
he would go on to tell fake news that was secretly meant to demoralize the
enemy.

157
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.710
Sefton Zalman was also a pause of the governments undergrounds propaganda

158
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:08.430
committee.

159
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.060
It was their job to connect rumors there were already spreading in German

160
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:15.570
communities and use those as the basis of the fake news.

161
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.980
By me using this strategy,

162
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.250
they were simply confirming what people were already whispering about,

163
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.030
so it was far easier for the audience to believe that what was being said was

164
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.620
true.
Along with that show,

165
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:30.180
Sefton Zelma wrote and produced a second radio program called Atlantic Center,

166
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:33.900
which was meant to seduce German soldiers.
They played jazz music,

167
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.090
which had been forbidden to German citizens.

168
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.250
A female actress called agonists Bernal,

169
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:42.240
who they call to Vicky it read the scripts and has sultry voice together with

170
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:44.250
another writer and spy,
Ian Fleming.

171
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.660
The Elmo put together stories that were basically erotic fan fiction of various

172
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.780
fantasy scenarios between German men and English women.

173
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.630
These stories worked exactly as he had hoped.

174
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.740
A former German officer named Horts Brito says that he would listen to Atlantic

175
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.440
center with the rest of the men who was stationed in a u boat.

176
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.750
Once he saw how truly beautiful the actress wells,

177
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:05.640
he asked for a copy of her photo and jokes.

178
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.450
If there were TVs on board the u boat and we saw these pictures,

179
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.790
a lot of them would say,
the Orris finished.

180
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.600
Let's go home and be with English girls.
Of course,

181
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:17.690
not everyone was a fan of these sexy stories.

182
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.600
A politician named staff had crips got a hold of an English translation of the

183
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.740
Dutch chef broadcast.

184
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.420
The particular script he read was a dirty story and that was an origins.

185
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.900
Crips was disgusted by how crude they were.
Heroes,
if this is how we win the war,

186
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.780
I'd rather lose it.
Despite receiving this criticism,

187
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:35.340
that show was able to continue.

188
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.850
The black propaganda team has really figured out what made men tick.

189
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.660
Ins there subversive messages manipulating them through sexual desires and

190
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:46.150
fantasies was actually working very well.
He has laser.

191
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:48.210
Ralph to the wall was one Delmas co-writer.

192
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.650
Ian Fleming has a light bulb moments if the German soldiers would go crazy

193
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.130
fantasizing over these characters,
so with the rest of the men in the worlds,

194
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.630
he continued to write these sexy stories.
I need this time.

195
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.160
The main character was a British spy who's adventures were based on his own

196
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:06.150
experiences during the war heroes,
pulp fiction novels about his alter ego.

197
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.380
James Bond's Dan was wife Isabelle would laser say that they were both having

198
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.900
the time of their lives creating this propaganda.

199
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.050
She thought it was hilarious that the government was essentially paying her to

200
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.400
draw a pornography for a living.

201
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.850
They recruited some of the most talented artists in the country to come and join

202
00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:25.290
the team and in del Mar had his own sense of humor for initiating new recruits.

203
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.160
A 22 year old artist named Marian why on was asked to join the secret

204
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:32.290
organization.
There were several British generals that are on the death,

205
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:32.880
our briefing.

206
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.910
They were all wearing their uniforms without even a hint of a smile on their

207
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.510
faces that Alma said that if she told anyone about the secret mission they were

208
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:43.620
about to give her,
she would be sent to jail and stuff.
At 10 years of hard labor.

209
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.850
She nervously agreed and as he slid a postcard of adult Hitler across the table,

210
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.110
the postcard was titled with the German phrase or two we have,
we hold.

211
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.190
Our first assignment was due tamper the guard,

212
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.720
so it looked as if Hitler was holding his own penis in his hand.
Decades later,

213
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.900
Marian White,
I'm told this story during an interview for a documentary.

214
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.390
She said that looking back,
she could have laughed,

215
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.380
but the atmosphere of the room was so serious.

216
00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:10.620
Story simply agreed to do the duty for our country as she left the room to get

217
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.160
started.
[inaudible] called out,
but not too big.
Marian.
Meanwhile,
in Germany,

218
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.660
the Nazis Minister of propaganda,

219
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:19.420
Joseph Goebbels has an entirely different strategy.

220
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.610
Instead of using Sutherland's creative writing,

221
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:23.980
he was loud and confidently stated,

222
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:28.030
bold lies about how the Jews were to blame the Germany's hardships for a

223
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:29.920
population of people who are desperate.

224
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.700
They clung onto the idea that they could blame the Jews for the economic

225
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:35.650
problems of Germany.
As time went on,

226
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:39.520
it became clear to Sefton Delmar and his team that rising Sussel jokes and sexy

227
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:44.140
stories was not going to be enough to win the war,
so they had to get darker.

228
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.180
Delmas team was able to find the exact typeface used in official German

229
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:48.910
documents.

230
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.540
This way they created fake court records and leaked to them to the public.

231
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.740
All of these fictional court cases were made to have the SS officers guilty of

232
00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:57.610
rape and murder.

233
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.360
He wrote excruciating details of the story only to have them acquitted of all

234
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:04.240
charges by the end.
This was obviously meant to outrage.

235
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.660
Anyone who read the documents and it made the Nazi government look like complete

236
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.494
monsters.

237
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.890
He wrote these to try to convince the German people that they were fighting for

238
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.720
an evil and corrupt government.

239
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.080
In 1943 he decided that he wanted it to stop the de chef broadcast,

240
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:21.100
but he knew that his character would never actually stop his radio broadcast and

241
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.030
less he was forced to,
so he wrote and stage to seed were Nazi soldiers,

242
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:28.450
came through the door to his studio and shot him.
While he was live on APP.

243
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.150
He hopes that if Nazi soldiers were out there listening,

244
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:34.630
they would realize that there was no such thing as freedom of the press and a

245
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:35.740
fascist government.

246
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.890
The longer the war wins on the higher the stakes became.

247
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.250
They felt that it was necessary to mess with the minds of German men in the

248
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:49.084
darkest white.

249
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.600
A lot of the information that was given to the black propaganda writers came

250
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.920
from highly skilled British intelligence agency were interrogating captured Nazi

251
00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:00.490
soldiers.
Whenever a Nazi soldier refused to say anything about his top secret

252
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:01.061
information,

253
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:04.720
they would try to get into relax and talk about his personal life instead

254
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.800
without realizing it.

255
00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:08.740
These soldiers were giving up information about the basis where they were

256
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:11.890
staying.
The bars were German soldiers,
drag and so on.

257
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.870
So since the names and details given out about the man on the radio or accurate,

258
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.840
they believed there must be a spy among them who was giving away all of their

259
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:20.500
information.

260
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.010
This made the Germans distrust one another and it was difficult for them to form

261
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:25.840
a close bond with their comrades.

262
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.140
They would read out the names of streets that had been apparently bombed in

263
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:31.030
Berlin and Hamburg.
Even if they hadn't,

264
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.060
they purposefully figured out where German you bomb lived so that they could

265
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:37.120
read out the specific addresses of all the men who were on the boats.

266
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.720
This would make the soldiers fall into a state of depression and anxiety and

267
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:42.030
completely ruin the morale.

268
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.030
Many of those German soldiers would go through the rest of the war feeling like

269
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.110
there's nothing to fight for.

270
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.920
The British also drops photographs of dead women and children over German basis,

271
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.440
which made them wonder if their own wives and children were among the debt.

272
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.160
Many of these men would be in the shock of their lives to go home and find out

273
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:00.380
that their family was still very much alive.

274
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.110
The Germans chose to do the same sort of propaganda.

275
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.800
I can leave with a strategy to make the allied soldiers want to end the war and

276
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:07.580
go home.

277
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.330
They played on men's jealousies with a sultry female voice playing over the

278
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:14.690
radio asking if they knew what their wives and girlfriends were doing without

279
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.090
them.
By the time the Americans during the war,

280
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.870
German planes were dropping leaflets of fake life magazines featuring

281
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:25.700
photographs of nude women on one side and death with a skull wearing a helmet on

282
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:29.600
the other.
There was also one leaflet that says,
gentlemen prefer blondes,

283
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:34.210
but blondes don't like cripples with the picture of an American veteran and

284
00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:35.030
beauty.

285
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.570
All of these dark campaigns that just have to in Delmas most heartless project,

286
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:42.020
yet it was called the dead letters.
British intelligence.

287
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:46.070
We're able to intercept letters written to German soldiers who it actually died.

288
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.900
Many of them were from concerns,

289
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.560
mother saying that they had not heard from their sons in awhile and they hoped

290
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:54.920
that they were safe.
If British intelligence managed to intercept those letters,

291
00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:58.520
Delmar could write back to these families came that the men were in hiding and

292
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.350
would soon be home.
At first.

293
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:03.470
This sounds like he was actually being kind to these German families.

294
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:06.410
Best off to reading enough of these letters over the radio.

295
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:10.130
The German soldiers who heard the broadcasts would hear the names of the men

296
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.990
they saw dying in front of their eyes.

297
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.080
They knew that someone was lying and they believe that the dead letters were

298
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.070
coming from the German government during these dark times.
Sefton dumb,
his wife,

299
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:20.750
Isabelle,
could not take it any longer.

300
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:25.250
She resented Delmar for how cruel he was being to his fellow human beings wall

301
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.590
or not.
The propaganda wasn't funny anymore.

302
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.040
She couldn't handle having any part of us and they ended up getting divorced.

303
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.610
The wall had left it scars and Isabelle would go through two more marriages

304
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:37.700
before the end of her life.
After World War Two stepped in Delmar,

305
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.650
return to his job at the daily express.

306
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.400
He published a novel called black and boomerang in 1962 but beyond that,

307
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.340
he lived out a quiet retirement.
So we'll just see Chrissy.

308
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:50.030
He never fully revealed the details of his time creating black propaganda until

309
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:54.470
the 1970s when enough time had passed and he was able to finally talk about his

310
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.800
experiences in his autobiography,
the counterfeit spy.

311
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.500
Today few people remember Sefton Demo,

312
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.520
how he was a voice of opposition for the gem and people who are used to hearing

313
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.940
the lies of out of Hitler and Joseph Girls.

314
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.420
Why don't we may never know just how many people heard is broadcasts.

315
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:15.860
We do know that his work was one of the many elements that helped the allies win

316
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:18.920
the war.
So I really hope you found that video.
