00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>loans.</v>

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Edward Armstrong was born as Lance Gunderson in Texas on September the 18th 1971</v>

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.761
<v Speaker 1>his mother,</v>

18
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:58.091
<v Speaker 1>Linda,</v>

19
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>was just 17 years old in a high school dropout.</v>

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>While his biological father at he Gunderson was a route or manager for the</v>

21
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Dallas Morning News,</v>

22
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>the marriage was an unhappy one with Eddie at proving to be abusive and</v>

23
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>neglectful.</v>

24
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>They divorced when lance was only two years old.</v>

25
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Before long lens up,</v>

26
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>she had remarried and Lance,</v>

27
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>his step father was a traveling salesman named Terry Armstrong.</v>

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong was a stern,</v>

29
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>distant man who never really bonded with lungs during his formative years.</v>

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Terry's job kept him Oh,</v>

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>away from home a lot,</v>

32
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>and when he was home,</v>

33
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>he proved to be a harsh disciplinary and who would beat lance with a paddle for</v>

34
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>any sort of incursion?</v>

35
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly,</v>

36
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the y looked forward to his stepfather's work trips when it was just him and his</v>

37
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.064
<v Speaker 1>mother at home.</v>

38
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.570
<v Speaker 1>As the years progressed,</v>

39
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the family's finances improved since they moved to better neighborhoods.</v>

40
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.920
<v Speaker 1>They ended up in Richardson where Linda signed up young lance for swimming</v>

41
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>lessons.</v>

42
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>She also bought him a bicycle.</v>

43
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Young Lance was an active,</v>

44
00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:56.081
<v Speaker 1>inquisitive.</v>

45
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Charles the often got into fights with one scuff were getting kicked off the</v>

46
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>school bus after which he rode his bicycle to school.</v>

47
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I love of competitive sports though.</v>

49
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He never really clicked with football,</v>

50
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>which was the dominant sport in Texas.</v>

51
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

52
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>he became passionate about her running and swimming.</v>

53
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Lance has an abundance of energy.</v>

54
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>His favorite TV show was the $6 million man,</v>

55
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>and he loved nothing better than to run around the neighborhoods pretending to</v>

56
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>be UV bionic man as he chunk did.</v>

57
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:26.560
<v Speaker 1>The words of the show's theme song better,</v>

58
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.603
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

59
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>faster from Richardson.</v>

60
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The Armstrongs move to Plano,</v>

61
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>

62
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 1>where Linda Linda's new job as a telecommunications company.</v>

63
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Secretary enabled them to buy their first house.</v>

64
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>It was here that they lived through the bulk of Lance's schooling.</v>

65
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>He attended the Armstrong middle school,</v>

66
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Williams hi and Plano East.</v>

67

<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

68
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Linda bought her son his first serious bike when he was seven years old.</v>

69
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>There was a Schwinn Mag scrambler BMX racing bike,</v>

70
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the bike along with a helmet and safety gear costs three times what Linda was</v>

00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:57.461
<v Speaker 1>sleeping dispense,</v>

72
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but she saw the value in her son involved in an outdoor sport.</v>

73
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Longs wrote his scrambler Antony was 13 when his mother bought him mercy I road</v>

74
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>bike with his competitive career began just 12 years old when he can beat it in</v>

75
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>the Plano swim club champs.</v>

76
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He saw some success,</v>

77
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but a year later he saw a poster for a triathlon and decided to switch to the</v>

78
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>three discipline event is first.</v>

79
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Triathlon was the [inaudible] kids,</v>

80
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>which he won pretty handily with.</v>

81
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.120
<v Speaker 1>His stepfather are often absent from the home loans.</v>

82
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Lacks a strong male role model.</v>

83
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>During his formative years.</v>

84
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>That role was filled in his early teens by Chris McCardy has Plano swimming,</v>

85
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>coach McCarthy trained Armstrong right through middle school and high school and</v>

86
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>encouraged him to compete on a national level and even to set his sights on the</v>

87
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Olympics and other man who took an interest in the teenage lance was the owner</v>

88
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>of a local bicycle shop and his name was Jim Height.</v>

89
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>He gave the Armstrongs discounts on equipment since lawns managed to answer</v>

90
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>money writing for the events that were sponsored by height.</v>

91
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>When Lance was 14 he competed and won his first.</v>

92
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you ask Lon consisting of swimming and running the prize was a $100 pair of</v>

93
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>avo running shoes.</v>

94
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.071
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

95
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>when the shoe's arrived in the mail,</v>

96
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>they did not fit.</v>

97
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>The sales rep who came to the Armstrong home with a replacement paths,</v>

98
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.063
<v Speaker 1>got Eder,</v>

99
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>ended up taking lance under his wing and taking him do work outs and</v>

100
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>competitions that took lance do the Cooper Institute in Dallas.</v>

101
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.550

102
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:32.551
<v Speaker 1>which came out at 79.5% it was the highest that they had ever seen.</v>

103
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>This men's of alarms had an incredible ability to make use of every breath of</v>

104
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>oxygen that came into his body.</v>

105
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>The testing also showed that he had the highest lactic acid threshold that they</v>

106
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 1>had ever come across through his formative years.</v>

107
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Lance had a knack for getting himself into quite a bit of trouble.</v>

108
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>The and his mates would sneak into the neighbor's house and steal beer from the</v>

109
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>fridge.</v>

110
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.261
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

111
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 1>he and another boy glued the mailbox as a man who they had argued with.</v>

112
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>The police eventually came calling when he stolen.</v>

113
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong street sign isn't ornaments for his room when he was 16 however,</v>

114
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>his mother told him that she was planning on leaving his stepfather.</v>

115
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

116
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.101
<v Speaker 1>Aj salons.</v>

117
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you stop getting into trouble that she wouldn't be able to handle the stress</v>

118
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>that it would bring to hop?</v>

119
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Moms responded to channeling all of his energy into a sporting events.</v>

120
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Molson Linda now spent most weekends together traveling to 10 k running events</v>

121
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and triathlons that he competed in during the week.</v>

122
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Mom spent many hours going on long rides with his cycling buddies.</v>

123
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Lindsey helped her son.</v>

124
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you see callus sponsors who would supply such things as she is and Jesse's</v>

125
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>every single sponsor received a handwritten letter of thanks from Lance.</v>

126
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So there are four competitive cycling categories.</v>

127
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>All writers start out a cat for freelance.</v>

128
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>This meant Tuesday nights criteria and rides at the local bike march.</v>

129
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't long before he moved up to cat three where he found himself training</v>

130
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>with a couple of cat one guys when he was 16 lance who's writing is messy,</v>

131
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>a racing bike along the Dallas country side when he was apparently run off the</v>

132
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>road by a truck driver,</v>

133
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>a furious lance curse at the driver from the asphalt.</v>

134
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>This caused the man to see red and the stocks his truck and got out in a rage</v>

135
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.100
<v Speaker 1>launch,</v>

136
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>jumped to his feet and took off.</v>

137
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>But the man trashed his bike before we left.</v>

138
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence managed to record it's number place and uh,</v>

139
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>proceeded to sue this man and when she used the money to buy his son and you</v>

140
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Randy bike with racing wheels,</v>

141
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 1>noncitizen you bike.</v>

142
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>They didn't last long.</v>

143
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Not long after receiving his,</v>

144
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>he was hit by an SUV while running a yellow light.</v>

145
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>He was thrown over the handlebars and onto the hood of the SUV.</v>

146
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>He was lucky to get away alive,</v>

147
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>especially since he wasn't wearing a helmet,</v>

148
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>who turns up at the hospital with a twisted foot,</v>

149
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 1>some scrapes,</v>

150
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and a concussion with his foot laced with stitches and the heavy brace lawns.</v>

151
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>His doctor told him to do nothing for the next three weeks,</v>

152
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but there was just one problem.</v>

153
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 1>He had a triathlon race in six days.</v>

154
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>The doctor simply told him to forget about it.</v>

155
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

156
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>he got rid of the brace on the second day,</v>

157
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 1>cut out the stitches himself with a nail clipper and turns up Hamas starting</v>

158
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

159
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>That Saturday he led the swim and the ride eventually coming in third when he</v>

160
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>heard about it,</v>

161
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>the doctor who had treated him,</v>

162
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>he could hardly believe that by the time of his final year in high school in</v>

163
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>1989 launched was a national level citing can pastor.</v>

164
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 1>He had qualifying to train with the junior national team at Colorado and</v>

165
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>preparation for the world junior championships.</v>

166
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Throughout his high school years,</v>

167
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Lance had missed a lot of school due to is traveling around the countryside to</v>

168
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

169
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>The school or however had viewed the absences as being on par with playing</v>

170
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 1>hooky.</v>

171
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>They told him that he did not have leave to go to Colorado or indeed to follow</v>

172
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>on to Moscow to compete in the world championships.</v>

173
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>The facts of that cycling wasn't even recognized as a sports by Texas high</v>

174
00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>schools at the time.</v>

175
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Certainly factored into their decision making more was to come though despite is</v>

176
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>working overtime to meet the requirements or meeting was called where lance and</v>

177
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>his mother were sold that he would not be able to graduate with his class that</v>

178
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

179
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>They didn't care that he was an emerging elite athletes with an unprecedented</v>

180
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to advance his career.</v>

181
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>So then once he was simply a slacker,</v>

182
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Linda soon got her son into a private school that would let him graduate the</v>

183
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>teachers of the new school bending Oaks Academy.</v>

184
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>We're happy to work around lancers schedule to help him complete his schooling.</v>

185
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong's fierce competitiveness brought into the attention of the coach of</v>

186
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>the u s national cycling team,</v>

187
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Chris Carmichael,</v>

188
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Carmichael,</v>

189
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>they didn't knows it.</v>

190
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>He was so aggressive that either had tear the field apart and the when or apple,</v>

191
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>everyone after him.</v>

192
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>So they blew by him at the ends.</v>

193
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Lawns qualified for and competed in the junior world champs in Moscow in 1989</v>

194
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>this was to prove to be his breakout,</v>

195
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>yet he got more attention than others because of his aggressive racing style and</v>

196
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>he broke away from the main group in the first lab arising in the front Peloton</v>

197
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and was right up there until the final thrust.</v>

198
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

199
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Stronger writers pushed ahead of him,</v>

200
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>his performance and Moscow in Mark's Armstrong as the most exciting new cyclist</v>

201
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>on the world stage,</v>

202
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>he showed himself to be an aggressive competitor with the ability to focus like</v>

203
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>a laser beam on achieving his goals.</v>

204
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>He was supremely confidence,</v>

205
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>which was easy to redesign arrogance.</v>

206
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>He also had no interest in writing as a part of a team.</v>

207
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>He did the ones anything due to attract him from his desire to cross the finish</v>

208
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

209
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.443
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

210
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.450
<v Speaker 1>it was in 1992 that Armstrong competed at his first Olympics in Barcelona.</v>

211
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.271
<v Speaker 1>He loves you,</v>

212
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:34.790
<v Speaker 1>recall the t road and miserably as an inexperienced hothead and to finish a</v>

213
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>disappointing 14 from the road race.</v>

214
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.531
<v Speaker 1>There's performance.</v>

215
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

216
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't enough to bring him to the attention of the director of a professional</v>

217
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 1>sports team,</v>

218
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>but we're sponsored by motor roller after the games lawns with signed on to the</v>

219
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:46.681
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>

220
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Speaker 1>which officially made him a professional athlete.</v>

221
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm just the major road,</v>

222
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:50.951
<v Speaker 1>the banner long.</v>

223
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It's traveled to Europe in order to compete in a series of road races as fast</v>

224
00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 1>race was and sounds sebasty in Spain and t came in dead last.</v>

225
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.100
<v Speaker 1>The crowd jeered at him when he crossed the line 30 minutes after the Winter</v>

226
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong with deflated after this race and he considered flying back to the</v>

227
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

228
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>But it's coach convinced him to stay and prove himself and prove to his</v>

229
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>teammates that he was no quitter and say,</v>

230
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:15.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

231
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>lawn stayed on from race to race.</v>

232
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>He got better and he came in second the Zurich championships finally telling</v>

233
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>himself that he was capable of doing this.</v>

234
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.121
<v Speaker 1>One of Lance,</v>

235
00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:30.121
<v Speaker 1>his biggest challenges with Motorola was learning to work as part of a cycling</v>

236
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

237
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.710
<v Speaker 1>He would quickly get frustrated with the other riders in his Palatan yelling at</v>

238
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>them to pull or get out of the way if as it is with trying to frustrate him on</v>

239
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:39.850
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

240
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 1>encouraging him to take the lead and wear himself out early after only 12 months</v>

241
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 1>as a professional cyclist,</v>

242
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Landis had already earned the nickname the king at the 1993 UCI track cycling</v>

243
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 1>world championship and also the Norway,</v>

244
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the motor roller team decided that he was ready to take the title and as they</v>

245
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 1>would work with him to win the race rather than rushing to the lead,</v>

246
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>he stayed in the Peloton until the second to last lap because he had been</v>

247
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 1>instructed dude.</v>

248
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Then he attacked to take the lead and stay that he crossed the line well ahead</v>

249
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>of the competition and the bounds of the crowd blew kisses and seeing what was</v>

250
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>to become his trademark.</v>

251
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.050
<v Speaker 1>He pointed to the Sky Armstrong.</v>

252
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.740
<v Speaker 1>He was now the world champion,</v>

253
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>this to truly be the vest.</v>

254
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 1>He knew that he had to win the Tour de France in 1995 he won a stage of the</v>

255
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 1>world's greatest grace,</v>

256
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>dedicating the win to a teammate who had died during a crash.</v>

257
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>In that very race in August of 1996 he signed a two year contract with the</v>

258
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>coffee as cycling team</v>

259
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.003
<v Speaker 2>France</v>

260
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>in 1996 salons notice that his right testicle was becoming swollen.</v>

261
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>This was followed by a dull ache and then a lack of energy.</v>

262
00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that it is performance.</v>

263
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 1>At the 96 Olympics,</v>

264
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Cindy had a disappointing finish and his memoirs.</v>

265
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>He recalled that he felt like he was dragging a manhole cover during the road</v>

266
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 1>race in October.</v>

267
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>After returning from the Olympics,</v>

268
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer.</v>

269
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

270
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 1>put off seeing a doctor,</v>

271
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>but when he began coughing up a blood,</v>

272
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 1>he knew that he had to act the news.</v>

273
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 1>It rocked Armstrong as well as the support team.</v>

274
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He was 25 an elite athlete and had stage three testicular cancer that had spread</v>

275
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.294
<v Speaker 1>to his brain,</v>

276
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.313
<v Speaker 1>his lungs,</v>

277
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.243
<v Speaker 1>and his abdomen.</v>

278
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>His chances of survival were estimated to be below 50% and it looked pretty</v>

279
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>likely that he would never race again.</v>

280
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Despite recently signing a two point $5 million contract with [inaudible],</v>

281
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>his team's liars decided that they would not provide insurance coverage during</v>

282
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>his treatments as the condition had not been advised at the time of the signing</v>

283
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 1>of the contract.</v>

284
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 1>They want to sponsors,</v>

285
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.101
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

286
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:53.680
<v Speaker 1>who did not abandon Armstrong during his time of need.</v>

287
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Oakley even offered for him to be covered under that health plan.</v>

288
00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong took on the cancer challenge with these same fierce determination that</v>

289
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>had made him a well champion.</v>

290
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.930
<v Speaker 1>He underwent a program of intense chemotherapy treatments.</v>

291
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 1>He sought our sentence,</v>

292
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 1>began treatment with a very caustic chemo cocktail known as v I.</v>

293
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 1>P which was less damaging on the lungs than conventional treatments.</v>

294
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.553
<v Speaker 1>This choice,</v>

295
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>it probably saved his cycling career throughout his chemo treatments.</v>

296
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong competed sporadically.</v>

297
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.303
<v Speaker 1>Understandably,</v>

298
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>he did not do well,</v>

299
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but he was keeping himself in the game.</v>

300
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 1>The final chemo treatments it took place on December the 13th 1996 and in</v>

301
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:34.201
<v Speaker 1>February of 1997 his doctors were able to confirm that his cancer was in full</v>

302
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.343
<v Speaker 1>remission</v>

303
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.980
<v Speaker 1>on the stronger sounds like competitive cycling.</v>

304
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:49.770
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of 1998 his contracts with coffee,</v>

305
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:54.390
<v Speaker 1>this had been canceled in 1997 and he had signed on with the US Postal Service</v>

306
00:13:54.391 --> 00:13:55.224
<v Speaker 1>something team.</v>

307
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.410
<v Speaker 1>He moved to Europe with the team to train for the tour to France.</v>

308
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong was now recognized as the poster child for being a cancer survivor.</v>

309
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.270
<v Speaker 1>He received many awards and many titles around 1998 he built successes one upon</v>

310
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:10.590
<v Speaker 1>another and the steadily improved.</v>

311
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Displacing that.</v>

312
00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:11.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:14:11.911 --> 00:14:13.650
<v Speaker 1>He also married his fiance,</v>

314
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Kristin Richard.</v>

315
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.630
<v Speaker 1>The marriage would last five years and it would produce three children.</v>

316
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm the strong one.</v>

317
00:14:19.561 --> 00:14:24.561
<v Speaker 1>His First Tour de France in 1999 he won four stages and had learned to work well</v>

318
00:14:24.721 --> 00:14:25.740
<v Speaker 1>with his teammates.</v>

319
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.551
<v Speaker 1>He finished the race.</v>

320
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's seven minutes and 37 seconds ahead of the second place finisher in a post</v>

321
00:14:31.111 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>when interview.</v>

322
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.590
<v Speaker 1>He proclaims if you get a second chance at life for something go all the way in</v>

323
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.650
<v Speaker 1>2000 and Armstrong came back to France to 10 mins to defend his title.</v>

324
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.090
<v Speaker 1>The race turned down to be a battle between him and [inaudible] Oreck who has</v>

325
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.050
<v Speaker 1>competed the previous.</v>

326
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.560
<v Speaker 1>This rivalry was to continue for the next five.</v>

328
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

329
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong cross the finish line.</v>

330
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Six minutes ahead of all Rick to become a two time champion.</v>

331
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong dominated the cycling world in the early 2000 years consecutive run of</v>

332
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Tour de France victories stretched on to an unprecedented seven in a row from</v>

333
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.670
<v Speaker 1>1999 to 2005 following his July 24th,</v>

334
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.650
<v Speaker 1>2005 when he announced his retirement from Connecticut</v>

335
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.583
<v Speaker 2>cycling</v>

336
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>in the way you his stunning 1999 Tour de France victory.</v>

337
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:30.590
<v Speaker 1>There were allegations that Armstrong must've been involved in either drug</v>

338
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 1>taking or blood doping.</v>

339
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 1>In early 2000 under the auspices of the Nike Corporation,</v>

340
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He created a documentary style advertisement entitled body in order to answer</v>

341
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>the detractors.</v>

342
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.870
<v Speaker 1>The film focused on his steely will to win and showed footage of him undergoing</v>

343
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.730
<v Speaker 1>drug tests.</v>

344
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.870
<v Speaker 1>The voiceover narration,</v>

345
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 1>it was done by Armstrong himself.</v>

346
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 1>At one point he says,</v>

347
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to know what I'm on.</v>

348
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.583
<v Speaker 1>What am I on?</v>

349
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my bike busting my ass six hours a day.</v>

350
00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.293
<v Speaker 1>What you wanted.</v>

351
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 1>When results came through that he had tested positive for a minute amount of</v>

352
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 1>corticosteroid.</v>

353
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>After the 99 Tour de France,</v>

354
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.600
<v Speaker 1>many people doubled down on their accusations,</v>

355
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 1>but the amounts in his body was seen.</v>

356
00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 1>My knew that they were not enough to fail the test.</v>

357
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Since that one little blip,</v>

358
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 1>he has never failed a drug test that has however been quite a lot of</v>

359
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>circumstantial evidence and 2004 a book was published called La Confidential,</v>

360
00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 1>which claims at the time strong had been using performance enhancing drugs.</v>

361
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.180
<v Speaker 1>They've quoted from Steve Swartz,</v>

362
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.750
<v Speaker 1>former motor roller team mate.</v>

363
00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 1>He claims that all the team members were using as far back as 1995 when</v>

364
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:37.820
<v Speaker 1>allegations made in the book were reprinted in the British newspaper The Sunday</v>

365
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Times.</v>

366
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong sued them leading to an out of court settlements.</v>

367
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.120
<v Speaker 1>In June of 2012 the U s antidoping agency brought allegations against Armstrong</v>

368
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.090
<v Speaker 1>of running a huge doping ring among his teammates cheering his competitive</v>

369
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

370
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.590
<v Speaker 1>They weren't armed with testimony from a number of former teammates.</v>

371
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Their goal was to have him banned from any sport that followed the world,</v>

372
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Anti Doping Code Lance.</v>

373
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.040
<v Speaker 1>He did not appeal the band.</v>

374
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong continued to vehemently denied the allegations of doping until 2013</v>

375
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.810
<v Speaker 1>then in a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.</v>

376
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 1>He admitted that he had used performance enhancing drugs for all of his tour de</v>

377
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:14.330
<v Speaker 1>France wins.</v>

378
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.840
<v Speaker 1>He claimed to have used a referee,</v>

379
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>poet in and human growth hormone and to have engaged in blood doping.</v>

380
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.803
<v Speaker 1>The reaction,</v>

381
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>it was one of outrage parties began lining up to sue Armstrong,</v>

382
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 1>including teammates that he had called Liars and parties that he had one libel</v>

383
00:17:28.461 --> 00:17:29.294
<v Speaker 1>suits against.</v>

384
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 1>The US Justice Department sued them for millions of dollars that the US Postal</v>

385
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Service it's spent on sponsorship to weld cycling,</v>

386
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:35.931
<v Speaker 1>Governing Body,</v>

387
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 1>a few day lifetime ban to Armstrong.</v>

388
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 1>He's still competes and amateur events.</v>

389
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:40.370
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

390
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.440
<v Speaker 1>today he owns a coffee shop in Austin,</v>

391
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Texas and they bike shop called mellow Johnny's.</v>

392
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Though he won't never shake the reputation as the world's greatest cycling</v>

393
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 1>cheat.</v>

394
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 1>He has built a life for himself that allows him to indulge his cycling passion</v>

395
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 1>and his competitive nature as an amateur athlete.</v>

396
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Following his successful cancer treatments,</v>

397
00:18:09.701 --> 00:18:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong started the Lance Armstrong Foundation.</v>

398
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It began with a fundraising race.</v>

399
00:18:14.501 --> 00:18:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you raise money for cancer research?</v>

400
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.590
<v Speaker 1>One of the most successful initiatives over the foundation was the production in</v>

401
00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:24.850
<v Speaker 1>2004 of a silicon bands in printed with the words live strong.</v>
