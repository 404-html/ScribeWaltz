1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.840
For 146 years.

2
00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:06.841
The Barnum and Bailey circus was known for being the greatest show on earth.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.110
None of it would've been possible if it were not for an ambitious entrepreneur

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.260
who was named p t Barnum while his life and career where sometimes the source of

5
00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:17.134
controversy.

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.520
He truly was a brilliant businessmen and many of his ideas forever changed the

7
00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.070
entertainment industry as we know it today.

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.800
Phineas Taylor Barnum was born in 1810 in Bethel,
Connecticut.
His parents,

9
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.970
Filo Barnum is Irene Taylor were fallen is he rents now rooms in their home for

10
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:49.440
a bit of extra income.
His grandfather was a well respected judge in the town.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.360
On the day of his baptism,

12
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:56.361
PT Barnum inherited a 4.6 acre piece of land from his grandfather called Ivy

13
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:58.770
Island.
His parents,
they were poor,

14
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:03.450
but as a child he grew up believing that he was the richest kid in town because

15
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.290
he thought that he had inherited a private islands somewhere where he could

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.780
build a house someday.
When he was 10 years old,

17
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.190
his parents finally took him on a trip to visit the islands where he discovered

18
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.710
this.
It was virtually worthless.

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.700
The island was simply muddy land in the middle of a swamp and it was filled with

20
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.220
poisonous snakes,
ticks and poison ivy.

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.160
He never did anything with that land today.

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.640
It's now part of a nature reserve called the Bethel Land Trust.

23
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.380
This was clearly disappointing to young Barnum and it left him yearning for a

24
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:37.950
reality where he truly would be rich enough to buy a private islands,

25
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.700
but he wasn't interested in the traditional ways of making money.

26
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.750
By his own admission,

27
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.550
had the reputation of being the laziest volume town because he hated doing farm

28
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.950
work and any sort of manual labor.

29
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.030
Instead of forcing Phineas into caring for the family farmer,

30
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:57.690
his father helped him get a job as a clerk in the town grocery store.

31
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.750
This was a perfect fit and Phineas grew to love the idea of running his own

32
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.100
business.
When he was only 15 years old,

33
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.950
his father died and he was now the man of the family.

34
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.150
This motivated and even more to make as much money as he possibly could.

35
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.680
He was possessed by the entrepreneurial spirit since he began trying different

36
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:18.600
business ventures right away.

37
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.040
His most successful business as a teenager was running a lottery while working

38
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:23.970
in the grocery store.

39
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:28.560
He has an endless supply of glass bottles and 10 advertising trays that he was

40
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.690
expected to simply throw away.

41
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.040
He knew that these items would be useful in people's homes and he wanted to

42
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.410
recycle them in some way,
but people,

43
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.740
they were not interested in buying these things.
Second hand,

44
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.680
he started selling tickets for a lottery.
Instead,

45
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
he promised that half of the tickets sold would be guaranteed to win something.

46
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.300
There were a few big cash prizes and also the Constellation prizes were the

47
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.470
items that he got for free.

48
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
He sold a thousand tickets in the first week and he continued to run the lottery

49
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.250
over and over again.
When he just 16 years old,

50
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.550
he used all the money he earns from these lotteries to move to Brooklyn,

51
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:06.250
New York to open his own grocery store.

52
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.600
Unfortunately though he calls small pox and had to move back to Connecticut so

53
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.880
his mother could help nurse him back to health.

54
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.720
After recovering from his illness,
he knew he needed to try again.

55
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.590
When he was 18 he opens up a confectionary store in his hometown that's sold

56
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:24.790
fruit and candy.
He was able to run more lotteries from this store.

57
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.320
He married his first wife charity Hallot when he was 19 years old and she was 21

58
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.530
they would eventually go on to have four daughters together.

59
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.660
Well and he never really was overly romantic.

60
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:39.661
He did rise that his wife was a treasure and to that without charity I am

61
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:44.140
nothing and he was 21 he wrote several passionate articles about politics and

62
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.650
sending them into the local newspaper bus.
They were all rejected.

63
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.220
He decided that if no one was going to publish as well,
he was self published,

64
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.040
his own paper goals,
Harold freedom.

65
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.190
He had enough money to buy his own printing press and he handed out the

66
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:59.590
newspapers in town and one of his articles,

67
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:02.590
he exposed the corrupt leaders of the towns,
local church,

68
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.090
the man suit and for liable,

69
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:06.580
and since he had no proof to back up his claims in court,

70
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.960
he ended up paying a $100 fine and spent 60 days in jail.

71
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.801
When he was released,

72
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.880
he became a local hero and a leader of the liberal movements.

73
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.500
Everyone loved him in Bridgeport because he decided that he achieved all he

74
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.870
could possibly achieve in Connecticut.

75
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.950
He wants it to move to New York City where he knew he would have many more

76
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:28.780
opportunities to earn a fortune

77
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.400
PT and charity bond and bought a boarding house in New York City so that they

78
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.450
could earn some income by renting out their extra rooms just like his parents

79
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:44.730
had done back and Canasta goes.

80
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.820
He used his knowledge from working in retail to have partial ownership of a

81
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:53.350
grocery store without having to do any of the work and he continued to run his

82
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.340
weekly lotteries.

83
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.790
He had set himself up in a pretty great financial situation and he was still

84
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.750
only in his early twenties his family,
these basic needs of food and housing,

85
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.780
when mass spurs his sites were on bigger and better ways to make as much money

86
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.700
as he possibly could.
When he was 25 years old,

87
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:14.590
he met a man who told him about Joyce half who was [inaudible] elderly African

88
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.423
American slave women.

89
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.600
She claims to be George Washington's nanny and it would go on and on with our

90
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:22.390
stories of that time together.
If this was true,

91
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.140
it would make a 161 years old.

92
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.400
Barnum was able to pay a owner $1,000 in order to put her on display.

93
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.550
She looked so incredibly old so that people actually believed that she may truly

94
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.300
have been 161 people came from all over New York City to see her.

95
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.180
She died after only one year of touring.

96
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.350
There was a public autopsy that revealed she was only about 80 years old,

97
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:51.970
but people,
we're not angry about the deception.
While it was a humbug.
People,

98
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.770
they still enjoyed the spectacle.

99
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.860
This gave PT Barnum a preview of the Shaman experience.

100
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.640
If he could find even more fantastic and interesting attractions.

101
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:06.380
He didn't have to do any of the hard manual labor that he dreaded so much.

102
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.760
He could just hire talented people to perform and to collect the money from

103
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:11.720
ticket sales.

104
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.070
PT Barnum trying to sell tickets to acts with performers who specialized in

105
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:17.480
juggling and his plate spinning,

106
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.310
but most of these shows they didn't do well because people had seen these acts

107
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:26.410
before.
He realized that he had gotten very lucky with having Joyce half.

108
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:28.160
This is very first attraction.

109
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.810
People wanted to pay for something they had never seen before that he had a

110
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:37.250
difficult time figuring out what to look for without having any experience in

111
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:38.420
the entertainment industry.

112
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.380
My name is 26 he temporarily left behind his wife and children to join a

113
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:46.280
traveling circus in order to educate himself on everything that he needed to

114
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.020
know about show business.

115
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.310
The owner of the circus was a man named Aaron Turner runs bone and told him that

116
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.620
he was eager to learn more about the business.

117
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.890
It's only designed it to give him firsthand experience with getting your crowns

118
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.580
attention.

119
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.240
The day before the opening show turn up pointed at PT Barnum when he was

120
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:07.010
standing in front of a crowd claiming that Barnum was reverend [inaudible]
Avery,

121
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.250
who was well known in the newspapers for the acquitted of murder.

122
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.960
Everyone knew that Avery was truly guilty and as they were all talking about
him,

123
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.240
not many people actually knew what he looks like,

124
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.480
but they all passionately hated this man.
Of course,

125
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:22.490
people believed Turner's Clayman's.

126
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.210
They began chasing after and he started running away the angry mob.

127
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.150
It got bigger and bigger and they weren't ready to take justice into their own

128
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:33.190
hands by lynching the murderer at the last moment,
Aaron,

129
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.160
it shouted that they were circus performance and that it was all a practical

130
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:37.730
joke.

131
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.780
Even though this could have been seen as bad publicity and it actually works.

132
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.290
Everyone in the town was talking about the angry mob and once it to know what

133
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.310
kinds of crazy men would pull such dangerous jokes on each other.

134
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.020
They bought tickets to the show.

135
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.340
The very next day after six months with the circus Barnum and started his own

136
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.370
small troupe of traveling performance called Barnum's,

137
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.890
grand scientific and a musical theater.

138
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.270
He even bought a steam boat to give tours and musical performances along the

139
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:08.960
river in the south,
but after about a year of living on the road,

140
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:10.430
he became very homesick.

141
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.790
He missed his wife and his children and he wanted stability.

142
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.300
He returns in New York hoping to find a way to display curiosity,

143
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:20.660
isn't performances without traveling from place to place

144
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.880
in 1841 barn and purchased the scutters American Museum and transformed it to be

145
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.260
a much more appealing place to visit.

146
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.280
The added flags to the outside and creators and elaborate a rooftop garden where

147
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.060
a hot air balloon gave people rides on a daily basis in science.

148
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.060
He had a knowledge array of exotic animals,
magicians,

149
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:48.060
and miniaturized recreation's of famous battles.

150
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.920
Pt Barnum was a genius when it came to getting more people to come to his

151
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:55.110
attractions.
When the American museum first,

152
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.500
he wasn't selling as many tickets as he hoped,

153
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.830
so he founds an unemployed man and paid him to run three ways,

154
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.980
cycle of various movements.
He would pick off a break on the street,

155
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:08.370
carry it to the door,
show his tickets to the museum,
ends,
walk inside.

156
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.420
Then he would walk back out again,
place the brick back down,
pick up another,

157
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.050
and it's continued to do this every single day to the point where people notice

158
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:18.660
this ritual on their way to and from work.

159
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.380
Some with even stopped to wash the mat and ask what he was doing.

160
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.850
It was enough to get people curious enough to buy a ticket for themselves so

161
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:29.400
they could see what was going on inside.

162
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.660
As time went on bone and use the money he made from ticket sales to improve the

163
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:37.380
quality of his displays.
He added one of his most famous hoaxes,

164
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.000
the Fiji Mermaid.

165
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.660
He claims that it was the body of the money that had been caught off the coast

166
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:43.200
of Fiji,

167
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.430
but it was really actually the skeleton of a monkey sewn on to a fish tail.

168
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.880
One of his most popular live exhibits was known as the freak show.

169
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.660
While some people disapprove of the fact that the exploited people with physical

170
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.590
abnormalities like bearded ladies and people with extra limbs,
he was given.

171
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.370
Many of these people work when they would have otherwise never found a job.

172
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.990
He also paid his employees very well and they were all treated like members of

173
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:07.740
the family.

174
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.940
Every single one of the members of the so called freak shows became incredibly

175
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.210
rich and all they had to do with stand on display.

176
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.650
Some of them chose to retire after just a few years of working and they went on

177
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:24.180
to get married and have very normal lives.
One Barnum was 33 years old,

178
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:28.470
had been running his American museum for a few years and it found some success,

179
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.120
but it was always looking for the next big thing.
He mentioned,

180
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:34.950
I'll Stratton who was one of his distant cousins.

181
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.380
Charles was only four years old when they match.

182
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.010
He was a proportion dwarf standing only at 25 inches tall.

183
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.650
He would stay the size of a baby for the rest of his life.
Charles,

184
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.240
his father was a carpenter,
so their family did not have a lot of money.

185
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.260
They were afraid for that son's future because not many dwarves could find work

186
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:56.370
outside of the entertainment industry and they were never the star of the show

187
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:00.900
anyway.
They were always just on the sidelines used as the butt of a joke.

188
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.490
PT Barnum agreed to be his cousin's manager and spent months teaching him how to

189
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:07.380
sing,
dance and act.

190
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.500
It was not sure how well the audiences would enjoy the show.

191
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:12.960
So at first he paid the boy's parents $3 a week,

192
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:16.050
which is the modern day equivalent of about $70.

193
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.090
His parents agreed and they were just happy that their young son could,
uh,

194
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.920
in any money at all.
Pt Barnum strategy with Charles,

195
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:27.360
his performance was to make him have the polar opposite of what people expected

196
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.223
from a dwarf.

197
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.790
He gave the boy at the stage name of Tom Thumb after the well loved English

198
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:36.570
fairy tale.
He also claims that he was already 10 years old instead of five,

199
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.120
which made us small snapchat even more incredible.

200
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.170
Thankfully Charles was a very smart child and he picked up on how to talk with

201
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:46.470
the bigger vocabulary of a 10 year old rather than a five year olds.

202
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.200
Barnum advertised Tom Thumb as a tiny gentlemen and dressing him men tailormade

203
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.900
suits.
He was able to memorize complicated lines and performed roles of dignified

204
00:11:55.901 --> 00:12:00.280
figures in history like Napoleon Bonaparte.
It works a treat.

205
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.350
He traveled all over the United States and Europe.

206
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:05.710
It becoming one of the world's first international celebrities,

207
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.390
even at Queen Victoria was a fan of this Tom Thumb.
As time went on,

208
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:15.391
PT Barnum hired other proportion dwarves to join his American museum and this is

209
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.390
where Charles straps and message future wife Lavinia Warren Bond and threw them

210
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.660
a wedding ceremony but became front page news presidents.

211
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:26.350
Abraham Lincoln was also a huge fan and threw them a honeymoon party at the

212
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:30.280
White House strategy,
made so much money through performing.

213
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.560
He could have retired at a very young age,

214
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:36.580
but he genuinely enjoyed it and he continued until he died.

215
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.530
At the age of 45 the museum became so popular that people would buy once I get

216
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.010
and stay there all day.
Even if they got to the end of the tour,

217
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.640
it would get so crowded at the bottom,

218
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.790
had to figure out a way to trick people into believing.

219
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.640
He put up a sign that said this way to the egress.

220
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.640
People assumed that this was a way to another attraction,

221
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:58.780
but the grass is just a fancy word for access.
Once they left the building,

222
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.990
they could no longer open the door and if they wanted to come back inside,

223
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:04.300
they needed to stand in line and buy another tickets

224
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.530
up to having so much success with his American museum bond was able to build a

225
00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:18.420
massive palace and can advocate for his family to live.

226
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.310
He called the home Iran has done because if it's Middle Eastern inspiration and

227
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.260
model of the building after the Brighton and Royal Pavilion in England,

228
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.050
which was the summer home of George Prince of Wales,

229
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.250
he was able to host events and bring in Themis guests from around the worlds

230
00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:37.020
like the author Mark Twain.
He used the large halls for musical performances.

231
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.840
He believes that by building such a huge castle,

232
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.790
famous musicians would be more likely to perform at his venues and it absolutely

233
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:47.460
worked in eating 50 PT Barnum traders like it,

234
00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:49.710
finding musical talent from overseas.

235
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.150
He convinced Steve Swedish opera singer named Jenny Linz to come to New York to

236
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:56.560
perform.
According to his autobiography,

237
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.480
Jenny Lens only agreed to travel to the United States because she saw the

238
00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:04.710
engraving of Iran has done on the invitation letter and she wanted to visit this

239
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:06.990
intriguing palace.
He had never heard her sing,

240
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:10.110
but he learns of her reputation when visiting Europe.

241
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.830
Barnum was taking a huge risk by hiring Jenny Lind,

242
00:14:13.831 --> 00:14:17.100
especially since he had no experience in the music industry,

243
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.280
even paid in advance to travel to the u s the barn used his marketing genius to

244
00:14:22.921 --> 00:14:27.570
hype up our rivals so much less Americans believed she was one of the greatest

245
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.470
singers in the wells and that they would be foolish to miss a limited time

246
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.670
performance.
He created posters that to the Swedish Nightingale,

247
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.230
how fast performance was held in the castle garden and tickets sold out.

248
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.940
The shows were so popular.

249
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.980
Jenny Lens performed with Barnum 93 times over the course of five months.

250
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.350
This new found fame gave her enough momentum to hire a new manager and on a

251
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:55.080
world tour,
Bonnen was taking a cut of the ticket sales,

252
00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.350
Jenny Linz and $350,000 while she was working with barn and for those few months

253
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.980
and she went on to make even more during our tour volume received $500,000 which

254
00:15:08.071 --> 00:15:12.450
is the modern day equivalent of nearly $15 million,

255
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.790
tragically in 1857 men who are hard to do repairs on Iran.

256
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.960
Istan Wild Barnum was aware.
New York,

257
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.470
that's a pipe burning when they left for the day and it caused a fire that

258
00:15:22.471 --> 00:15:25.050
destroyed everything has an insurance policy,

259
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:30.170
was only paid out to $28,000 even though it costs over 150,000 to build the

260
00:15:31.141 --> 00:15:35.250
mansion.
And then in 1865 the American museum burned down as well.

261
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.550
He rebuild the museum that after only being open for a couple of years,

262
00:15:38.551 --> 00:15:43.020
that burned down for a second time.
Barnum said the fires burned to the ground,

263
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.000
all of his life's accomplishments,

264
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.330
60 years old,
PT Barnum's life was a rollercoaster of success and failure.

265
00:15:56.331 --> 00:16:00.830
He was at an age when most men would decided to cut their losses and just
retire.

266
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.460
But one of the many things that made PT Barnum Icentra success was that he

267
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:07.520
didn't ask his failures,
stop him from moving forward.

268
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:11.360
His children all grown up and his wife charity had sadly passed away.

269
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.800
He decided that the time was right in his life to start a traveling circus.

270
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.090
He was the very first circus owner to buy his own trains,

271
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.830
move the performers and equipment from place to place.

272
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.130
He paid his work as well and he made sure to use bright,
colorful,

273
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:28.310
elaborate 10 sends equipments which would attract crowds.

274
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.510
His first traveling show was called PT Barnum's,
Grand Traveling Museum,

275
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.000
Monogatari Caravan and hippodrome.

276
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.380
This had many of the same attraction and see once had in as American museum only

277
00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:43.160
on a much grander scale.
People outside of New York City.

278
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:46.010
We're able to see his freak show,
his animal Menachem juries,

279
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.670
and is impressive acrobats that he had collected over the years of networking

280
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:53.960
and making friends in show business in 1881 when he was 71 years old,

281
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:57.750
he joins up with another circus which was owned by James Bailey ans they're

282
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.370
combined and cuts became the famous Barnum and Bailey,

283
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:05.790
the greatest show on earth.
They were the first three ring circus meaningless.

284
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.750
They would have three different acts going on at the same time.

285
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.590
One of his biggest attractions at the Barnum and Bailey Circus was jumbo,

286
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:13.424
the elephant.

287
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.180
He was one of the most popular animals for children in London and his kids in

288
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:18.800
America.
They felt the same way.

289
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.070
Everyone was mesmerized by the massive scale of the circus and they only

290
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:27.020
continued to improve upon the show.
As time went on,

291
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.010
the Barnum and Bailey circus continued to talk long after his death ending in

292
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:36.011
2017 it went on for 146 years.

293
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.580
As he grew older,

294
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.570
fewer and fewer people criticized PT Barnum for the tricks that he played on

295
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:51.960
audiences and more people recognize the impact that he made on the entertainment

296
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:55.350
industry.
He was well respected by just about everybody.

297
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.120
He wrote four books in his later years,

298
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.870
including one called the art of money getting and another book humbugs if the

299
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.320
wells.

300
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.320
He was very candid about psychics and magicians tricks and even called out Harry

301
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.690
Houdini.

302
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:11.070
He knew all the tricks of the trade as a route that he would pay $500 to any

303
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:15.360
medium who could truly convinced him that they were actually talking to the
debt.

304
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.740
There's point was that even though we know that magic and ghosts are not real,

305
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.590
that doesn't mean we can't enjoy the spectacle.

306
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.730
Very few people know that PT Barnum took politics very seriously,

307
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.200
especially in his later years and his autobiography he wrote to this man who

308
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:32.910
takes no interest in politics,

309
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.200
is unfit to live in our lands where the government rests in the hands of the

310
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:37.860
people.

311
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.170
In 1865 US congress would be voting on the amendment of the Constitution to

312
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.040
outlaw slavery.
Technically,

313
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.490
he has once been a slave owner himself with Joyce half,

314
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.270
but he now worked with and love of so many African American performers that he

315
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:55.200
felt passionately about fighting for their freedom and to use his money and

316
00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:59.440
connections to join the Republican Party as part of the Connecticut legislature

317
00:18:59.441 --> 00:18:59.940
chat.

318
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.940
He wanted to do everything within his power to help end slavery in the United

319
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.760
States and they succeed at the time he spends on the Connecticut legislature.

320
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.680
Wasn't the end of his political career though.

321
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.410
In 1875 he became the mayor of Bridgeport,

322
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:17.760
Connecticut and he served for one year and he was getting older,
PT Barnum page,

323
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.930
a reporter from the local newspaper to write if very flattering eulogy so that

324
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.960
he could hear and enjoy it while he was still alive.

325
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.710
He died in 1891 of a stroke of 79 years old.

326
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.270
He loves his job so much that he was working up until the day he died and his

327
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:37.890
last words were a request to look over some receipts.
Two years after his death,

328
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.641
a statue,

329
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:42.510
it's spelled in seaside park in Bridgeport can as it goes on land that he had

330
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:44.070
donated to the city today.

331
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:48.420
His legacy still lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone who remembers the

332
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:52.740
circus and his workers influenced entertainments as we know it throughout the

333
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.680
world.
