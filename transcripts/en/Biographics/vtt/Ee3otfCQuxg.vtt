claim as a shock to all the children.

25
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:46.110
He thought that their mother was a contented housewife who has everything she

26
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:49.320
ever wanted.
However,
Frank Sr was active in local politics.

27
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:52.890
He was active in the management of the New York Yacht club and he also was a

28
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.210
very keen,
deep sea fishermen.

29
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.510
All of these interests meant that he was often away from home.

30
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.380
One day he came home from an overseas marlin fishing adventure to find that his

31
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:04.500
wife and kids that's simply moved out.
Frank Sr,

32
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.690
he was crushed by the separation.

33
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:10.800
He deeply loved his wife and fought to get her back until the day that he died.

34
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.220
The pullouts mines,
it was made up as a sign of independence.

35
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:18.570
She enrolled in dental college and began building a life of our own.
Frank Sr.

36
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.260
He recruited junior to help him win back Paul.
That's affections.

37
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.920
He would give his son gifts to pass on schooling him on what to say and how to

38
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.650
say it,
but Paul ass,
she wouldn't budge.

39
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.320
The couple divorced when frank was only 14

40
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.520
unlike your siblings frank chose,
do you live with his father?

41
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.760
This opens up a whole new world for the teenager who had been used to a regimen

42
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.050
and disciplines life with his mother.
Tagging along with his dad.

43
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.770
He began spending time in the bars around New York is frank senior wheeled and

44
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.560
dealed amongst the cities,
businessmen and politicians.

45
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.920
They experience it quickly made the boy very streetwise.

46
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.300
It was around this time frank began to skip school in order to run with a

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.500
handful of local punk scene where like him from dysfunctional families and they

48
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.250
were looking for some way to express their frustrations.
Frank,

49
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.010
who is bigger and more mature looking than as associates,

50
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.380
which was handy when it came to playing hooky.

51
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.730
He was often mistaken for a teacher on an outing with his students.

52
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.390
The group committed minor crimes like sneaking into movie theaters and stealing

53
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.200
candy.
Frank soon became frustrated with the childishness and his lack of

54
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:29.620
sophistication of his partners in crime that they did not exhibit any of the

55
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.610
costs that he realized was key to making it as a successful criminal.

56
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.990
Things came to a head when his friends stole a car while the owner was watering

57
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.190
his lawn.
They swung by to pick up.
Franco needs to be stopped by the police.

58
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:45.820
Moments later,
frank and his fellow cons web thrown into juvenile detention,

59
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.650
frank seniors,
political connections,

60
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.060
they managed to get his son sprung to have any mention of the incidents and

61
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.330
raised from the rack art.

62
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.890
Frank's down at told him that he was wasting his time hanging around with kids

63
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:00.490
who were clearly not as mature or as sophisticated as he was.

64
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.320
It was time to start acting like a man.
His father set this pep talk.

65
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.380
It seems to do the trick and frank began attending school regularly.

66
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.820
He also got a part time job as a shipping clerk at a warehouse and Bronxville to

67
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.180
show his support for his son's change of direction.

68
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.000
Frank Sr bought him his first car,
an old Ford.

69
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.550
<v 0>Having a set of wheels opens up new horizons for Frank Specifically,</v>

71
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:32.660
it allowed him to meet and enjoy the company of women the next couple of years.

72
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:36.860
By his own admission,
he was consumed with satisfying his teenage libido.

73
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.520
He would cruise around town looking for a young lady that he could entice with

74
00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:43.580
this ever growing chime into an evening of intimate activity.

75
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.300
Frank soon discovered that his sexual excursions,
they cost money.

76
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.470
Invariably it after you supply his conquest with a coconut Berger in order to

77
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:52.304
keep her happy.

78
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.690
They're all the ones that his mega finances did not allow for such an expense.

79
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.470
Frank approached his dad's and requested a gas charge card.

80
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.550
He promised that he wouldn't abuse this privilege and his father was impressed

81
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.940
with his sincerity.
He handed over his mobile card.

82
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.980
Soon after I'm on filets up.

83
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.940
Frank in access his fest scam bleed into a Mobil gas station.

84
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.870
He saw a sign announcing that you can put a new set of tires on your car and

85
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:19.670
charge it to your mobile cart.

86
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.480
It was then that he realized that you could use the cart for other things aside

87
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.160
from gas thinking fast.

88
00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:28.100
He approached in attendance at the station that he was familiar with.

89
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.950
Frank asked what it would cost for a new set of tires,

90
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:35.780
and the answer was $160 frank readily acknowledged that he didn't need new

91
00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:38.630
tires,
but said that he was desperately short of cash,

92
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.620
so he suggested that he buy the set of tires and charged them to the conduit.

93
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.970
Rather than taking the tires,
the attendant would give frank $100 for them.

94
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.130
He could then sell off the tires for $160 making a quick $60 profit.

95
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.020
10 minutes later at frank drove away from the mobile station with $100 cash in

96
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.980
pocket and it was that which looked him over the next few weeks,

97
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.610
frank replicated the scheme of different mobile stations around the Bronx.

98
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.880
At times he would simplify the deal offering the pump attendant.

99
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:12.140
Do you give him $10 of cash?
Well,
signing a bill for $20 of gas.

100
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.010
It was only when the bill from mobile arrived that frank realized that his

101
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:20.410
father was the chump who would pay for his excesses.
But Frank,
yeah,

102
00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:24.170
to simple solution.
He threw the bills into the waistband.
Of course,

103
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.120
though that wasn't a solution at all.
It didn't solve anything.
Pretty soon,

104
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.460
a mobile representative visited frank senior at his store and requested an

105
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:36.461
explanation for an outstanding 3000 or $400 bill in three months.

106
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.060
After 15 years of impeccable payment history,

107
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.240
frank jr when he was called in,
friends of both men to explain,

108
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.460
he said he didn't know what they were talking about,

109
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:51.170
but neither man was convinced.
Finally,
frank admitted is offering this excuse.

110
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.980
It's the girls that they do funny things to me.
I can't explain it.

111
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.100
His father nodded with a wry smile and replies,

112
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.140
don't worry about it by Einstein.
Couldn't understand it either.
Unfortunately,

113
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:06.380
for young frank,
his mother wasn't so understanding.

114
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.800
She blamed his criminal activity on the influence of his father,

115
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.250
promised him the organized for him to attend a Catholic private school for

116
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.084
problem children.

117
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.260
Frank spent a year that and during those 12 months his father's financial

118
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.950
fortunes took a steep reverse and he lost almost everything.

119
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.930
He was quick to assure his son that the $3,400 that he had stolen was not a

120
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:28.910
factor in his money problems.

121
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.550
Frank left home at 16 he left without saying a word to anyone,

122
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.510
hopping on a train to New York City along with the few belongings that he had

123
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:47.370
crammed into a suitcase he has in his possession of checkbook that had $200 in

124
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:49.050
the account,
an hour off the train.

125
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:52.560
He had attached himself to a teenage boy and convinced him to take him home with

126
00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:52.910
them.

127
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.910
Frank wins on to spin a story about being an orphan and that he was determined

128
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:58.500
to make it on his own and the big city.

129
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.400
The parents said that he could stay for as long as he wanted.
The next day,

130
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.210
frank got a job as a stock clerk for $1 and 50 cents per hour.

131
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.540
He quickly found out that this was not going to pay his way in New York.

132
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.050
He they that the reason for his low wage was his age.

133
00:08:13.051 --> 00:08:18.051
So he simply alter the date on his driver's license from 1948 to 1938 now,

134
00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:19.040
as a 26 year olds,

135
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.870
he went out and looking for another job and he found one as a truck,

136
00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:25.200
driver's helper for $2 and 75 cents an hour.

137
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.320
Brang supplemented his income by cashing checks from his account.

138
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.780
After a few days,
he knew that his account was overdrawn,

139
00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:32.940
but that technicality did not phase him.

140
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.180
He continued writing bad checks on a daily basis.

141
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.200
It didn't take him long to rationalize that his time working for $2 and 75 cents

142
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:42.990
an hour was simply not worth the effort.
Therefore,

143
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:46.110
he quit and simply route more bad checks.

144
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.420
One day while walking along 42nd street,
frank was stopped in his tracks,
uh,

145
00:08:56.421 --> 00:09:00.480
beside of an air crew from eastern airlines emerging from the Commodore Hotel.

146
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.240
He was mesmerized as the captain copilots flight engineer in four stewardesses

147
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.020
breezed by frank,

148
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.520
arose in his memoir that he had never seen such a splendid group of people is,

149
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.640
mind's,
begins work over time.
Imagine if he was a pilot.

150
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.810
He was half instant respects and as a result he would be able to cash checks

151
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:21.690
anywhere with impunity continuing down the street.

152
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:25.860
He found himself outside of the Pan Am building quickly.
He formulated a plan.

153
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.360
He returned to his accommodation,

154
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.290
found Pan Am's phone number rang and asked to speak to someone in the purchasing

155
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.100
departments.

156
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.640
He went on to inform the purchasing officer that he was a pan and pilots based

157
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:36.510
in Los Angeles.

158
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.890
He was due to hopper flies back home at 8:00 PM but his uniform had been stolen.

159
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.890
You confidently requested a replacement uniform.
They helpful purchasing officer,

160
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.270
gave frank directions to the uniform company to pick up his uniform.

161
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.930
He walked out with a complete copilots uniform and hands.

162
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.930
What do you needed now as a pilot's ID card?
You quickly,

163
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:58.010
you had one made up or fixing the Pan Am logo from a model play in the dia

164
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.820
purchased for $2 and 49 cents.
Dax out in his pilot uniform,

165
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.100
frank walked in to Laguardia Airport.

166
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.750
He was soon approached by a TWA pilot who bossed white Pan Am was doing at

167
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:10.584
Laguardia.

168
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.670
It turns out that pan did not fly out of Laguardia Bucking up on his research.

169
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:18.240
Frank Replies,
Oh,
I just dead headed in from Frisco on the first flight.

170
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:22.440
I could cash.
I'll cassia tropic to Kennedy.
The answers seem to satisfy,

171
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.710
but then the copilot asked,
what kind of equipment do you want this?

172
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:27.180
Through frank and his research,

173
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:30.690
he hadn't come across the word equipment used in any context searching for the

174
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:33.480
right answer.
He came out with General Electric.

175
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.570
The pilot was actually asking what type of clean frank flew,

176
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:40.380
so the quizzical look on his face that this reply was rather understandable.

177
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.210
Frank quickly meters departure.

178
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.820
He didn't attempt to do border blame that first day.

179
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.600
He was disbanded some weeks getting confidence in his role as he wanted.

180
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:52.530
The airport struck up conversations with pilots and built his store of shop

181
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:53.850
knowledge.
During this time.

182
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:58.140
He also found great success and cashing checks and his pilot's uniform.
In fact,

183
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.750
the tellers,
they couldn't give him cash fast enough.

184
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.700
Finally ready to take to the skies.

185
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:06.120
Frank turned up at the Guardian is eastern operations office and informs the

186
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:09.360
desk clerk that he needed to deadhead to Miami on the next flight.

187
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.830
Assuming that that was really,

188
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:14.190
I'm on the plane and heading was the name used for the practice of allowing

189
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:17.010
staff to travel for free in order to get to a job location.

190
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.520
He was told there was a vacancy on a flight departing in 15 minutes.

191
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.570
Just a few moments later,

192
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:25.200
he found himself in the cockpit in a tiny seeds that came down from the door

193
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:28.740
behind him with them where the pilots copilots and flight attendants.
Well,

194
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:30.330
if you're asking what type of equipment he flew,

195
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:32.970
the three pretty much ignored him for the rest of the flight.

196
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.230
Before getting off at Miami,

197
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.790
frank made a date with one of the stewardesses who was laying over in Miami that

198
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.310
night.
Amazed how simple the whole process had been.

199
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:44.880
Frank became a serial dead header.
Upon arriving in a city,

200
00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:49.020
he would stay overnight in a motel used by pan and staff is challenge to the

201
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.140
bills of the company and in the morning before heading to his next debt,

202
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:57.141
had flight a bad check for $100 or more just to have some ready cash.

203
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.610
This Pason continued for the next two years between the ages of 16 and 18 taking

204
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:08.491
him to 26 countries on more than 250 flights that covered in excess of a million

205
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.883
miles.

206
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

207
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.680
<v 0>By the middle of 1966 frank was ready for a new gig.</v>

208
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.490
He had experienced a close call when someone had stated that he didn't actually

209
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:26.440
work for Pan out.
Fortunately,

210
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.410
his bluster and feigned outrage got in through the challenge,

211
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:32.410
but he knew that eventually the game was going to be up.

212
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.620
It was when applying for a long term lease on an apartment in Atlanta,

213
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:39.760
Georgia that he bought on a whim,
wrote down his profession as medical doctor.

214
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.440
When asked what type of doctorate he was,

215
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:43.990
he replied that he was a pediatrician based in California,

216
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:47.650
but it was on a 12 month sabbatical to audit some research papers.

217
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.160
Things went well for a period of time and so one day he'd got a knock at the

218
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:52.480
door.
Here's new neighbor,

219
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.140
introduced himself real a screenshot doctor with a stranger,

220
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.280
chief resident pediatrician at the Smith as General Hospital in Marietta.

221
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.160
Frank was afraid that Granger would blow his cover,

222
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:07.150
but fortunately the real doctor wasn't one to talk sharpens they were able to

223
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.610
cross each other's paths without incidents.
Meanwhile,

224
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:12.910
frank spent as much time as he could at the local library reading up on the

225
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:15.420
subject of pediatrics.
A few weeks later,

226
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.520
frank felt confidence enough to accept an offer from Dr. Green Jyoti Toss

227
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:24.090
Smithers general hospital.
After that,
he made regular visits on one subjugation.

228
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.900
He was approached by the hospital administrator and to to do a huge favor could

229
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:31.450
he cover a midnight to eight shift for a doctor.

230
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.300
He would be away for 10 days due to a death in the family.

231
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.080
Frank objected that he didn't have a license to practice in Georgia,

232
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:41.590
but the administrator countered that he really wouldn't be doing anything during

233
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:44.530
the night shift just overseeing the interns and nurses.

234
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.200
So long as he passed an interview panel of five doctors,

235
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.460
everything would be just fine.
Franklin initial impulse was to refuse.

236
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:53.460
They weren't too many dangers involved in,

237
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.450
but he was intrigued with a challenge and so he agreed much to Frank's early.

238
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:01.450
If the interview was lighthearted and non inquisitorial,

239
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.810
he was now a night shift.
Pediatric supervising doctor,

240
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:08.140
we've eight enzymes and 40 nurses under his control.

241
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.440
In order to make it through you,

242
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.880
frank took on the pest side under of a rule of breaking antiestablishment

243
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:16.450
practitioner in the moles of Hawkeye Pierce on his favorite TV show,

244
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:20.290
mash things went smoothly until he was called to the emergency room.

245
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.380
He took his time getting that,
hoping that an intern would step in.

246
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.130
When he finally arrived,
there were three enzymes gathered around the patient,

247
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.490
Frank Austin for their diagnoses and twin.
All three agreed.

248
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.870
He told them to go ahead with the procedure at the end of his 10 days stints.

249
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.860
Frank was approached by the administrator in informs that the doctor he was

250
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:40.720
replacing was not coming back.

251
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.720
It was asked if he could stay on until a replacement could be found.

252
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.490
He ended up spending 11 months as a doctor at Smithers hospital.

253
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.410
I'll have to finishing up at the hospital.
Frank decided to leave Atlanta.

254
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.350
He moved to Baton Rouge,
Louisiana,

255
00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:02.620
where he mess up with a flight steward that he had formerly had a relationship

256
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:06.490
with remembering the frank consoles error about his supposed law degree from

257
00:15:06.491 --> 00:15:10.360
Harvard.
The girl introduced him at a party to assistant state's attorney,

258
00:15:10.361 --> 00:15:13.630
Jason Wilcox,
on learning,
but frank was currently out of work.

259
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:16.570
Wilcox told him that the attorney general was looking for bright,

260
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.220
articulate young lawyers.

261
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.310
He suggested the frank take the bar exam and go to practice with them.

262
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.640
Once again.
Frank found it impossible to resist the challenge.

263
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.680
On his third attempt,
he passed the bar exam.

264
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.830
He was given a position in one of the attorney general's civil departments if

265
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.100
the job was really bad of a glorified Aaron's by,

266
00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:36.430
but frank was happy in the anonymity of the role around this time.

267
00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:38.620
He began dating a girl named Gloria,

268
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:41.320
who was a staunch Methodists three has a relationship.

269
00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:45.100
He ended up on a church committee sitting alongside a man who was a real

270
00:15:45.101 --> 00:15:46.960
graduates of Harvard law school.

271
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.040
This guy began asking too many specific questions and frank knew that it was

272
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.440
time to pull the plug on his legal career.

273
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.830
Frank next turned up in Utah where he claims to have scammed his way into

274
00:15:56.831 --> 00:16:00.490
becoming a teacher at Brigham Young University for eight months.
However,

275
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:03.070
the university denies that he ever works there.

276
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.531
Why now?

277
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:13.430
Frank was wanted in many parts of the world for a long list of fraudulent

278
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.910
activities.
The FBI where on his trail as it was in DePaul,

279
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.900
his luck finally ran out while he was spending time in the southern French town

280
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:21.860
of mantra sharp.

281
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.730
He was arrested on the basis of an instapot warrant for fraud issued from Sweden

282
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:29.270
for fraudulent checks written during a visit while he was supposedly a Pan Am

283
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:30.890
employee,
the French authorities,

284
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:34.760
they soon discovered that he had written false tracks all over that country and

285
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.770
they refuse to honor the extradition.

286
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.950
Frank was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment in France,

287
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.610
which after being reduced to six months,
was served at a perfect non prison.

288
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Conditions were abysmal and Frank's weight went from 198 to 109 pounds during

289
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:53.120
the stay that he was then extradited to Sweden where he served another six

290
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:55.910
months upon his release from Malmo prison in Sweden,

291
00:16:55.911 --> 00:17:00.530
frank was taken into custody by US federal officials and returned to the United

292
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.610
States.
After a third trial,

293
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:05.480
he was convicted do 12 years imprisonment for multiple cases of fraud.

294
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.480
During his time in US custody,
he escaped twice,

295
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.520
but was recaptured on both occasions.

296
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

297
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.950
