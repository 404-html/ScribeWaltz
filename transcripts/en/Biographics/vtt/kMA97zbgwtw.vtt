1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.410
I thought if I commend where's a thin little man with bowlegs as a hook nose in

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:06.800
the civilian world,
he had been viewed as of new accounts,

3
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:10.110
are socially awkward laser with little to redeem himself,

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.760
I think joined the Nazi party.
However,

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.230
his unquestioning commitment to orders coupled with his need for ruthless

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.064
efficiency,

7
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.630
allowing him to carve out of Korea though would see him go down as one of the

8
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:26.600
greatest mass murderers in human history and this week's biographics.

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.020
We trace the life,
the crimes and the death of ad off Eichmann.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.821
I don't fall through.

11
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:52.800
Eichmann was born and Zuellig and Germany on march the 19th 1906 do bookkeeper.

12
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.880
I don't have call Eichmann and his wife Maria,
the oldest of five children,

13
00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.360
young adults was a nervous,
shy child with few friends.

14
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.470
When he was seven years old,

15
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.010
his father moved to Lynn's to take a job as a commercial manager for the city's

16
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.050
electrical provider with the rest of the family.

17
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.530
Following a year later in Lynn's out of attended the kinds of friends,

18
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:11.760
Joseph Secondary School,

19
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.140
the same school that ad off hitting a rigid ended in the 1890s he remains an

20
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:20.340
aloof and lonely child and his parents worried about his lack of social skills.

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.420
His dark complexion and distinctive knows and Dheas led to his school mates

22
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:28.590
teasing him with a nickname deck,
Klein Judah,
or the little Jew.

23
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.180
I don't prove to be a mediocre student at best.
By the time he became a teenager,

24
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.670
he had a reputation as being difficult and moody with his father having written

25
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:41.580
him off as a no hoper with little promise,
a furthering an education.

26
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.970
He quit school at the age of 15 and has began to train as a mechanic.

27
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
That's this to you proved to be a failure after too frustrating years.

28
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.890
He gave up on this career and took a job as a sales agent for a mining company.

29
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.260
This job also lasted for two years.
Afterwards.

30
00:01:55.261 --> 00:02:00.240
She became a district agents for an all company by the age of 25 Eichmann was a

31
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.530
Sullen,
withdrawn,

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.010
and socially and apps are the four man who could still be mistaken for a Jew.

33
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.480
He had a stable but uninspiring job that saw him working around Upper Austria in

34
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:14.481
Salzburg in 1932 despite having never shown any interest in political affairs,

35
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.610
he joins the National Socialist Party.

36
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.630
His association with the Party began at the urging of a friend by the name of

37
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.630
[inaudible] Bruner,
who was a party official

38
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.980
for Eichmann the party.

39
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:40.000
We'd give them an opportunity to belong to a group and to advance his station in

40
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.560
life more than anything.

41
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.360
He wanted to be somebody and wanted to prove to the world that he had value as

42
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:47.194
an individual.

43
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.700
In November of 1932 he was accepted into the ranks of the SS with his duties

44
00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:56.140
involving forming part of the protection squad for speakers at party rallies as

45
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.960
well as gardening the party headquarters that lense at the same.

46
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.500
He was still working for the oil company a few weeks after Hitler became

47
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.880
chancellor of Germany in January of 1933 I commend lost his job.

48
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.290
Do you have to staff cut backs?

49
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.110
He immediately applied for active assets duty in Germany.

50
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.190
This was accepted them as he proved to be a diligent follower of orders rising

51
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.860
to the rank of shore for Yara in just a few months.

52
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.140
In November of 1933 he was appointed to the administrative staff of the dot

53
00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:27.141
Hsiao concentration camp at shall I Cummins job was to keep a detailed catalog

54
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:31.270
of all the items that were being confiscated from incoming Jewish prisoners.

55
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.440
He did his job well,
but found it to be exceedingly boring.
Around this time,

56
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.640
you began to set his mind to studying and inculcating the basic principles of

57
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:41.920
Nazi-ism in something I bought.
He had come to believe.

58
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.730
He says if they had told me that my own father was a traitor and I had to kill

59
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:46.330
him,

60
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.740
I'd have done it in under CMT breakouts of is monotonous routine at Dap Shao in

61
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.530
1934 I couldn't apply to join the SD,

62
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.900
which was the security service of the SS.

63
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.320
His application was successful and he was transferred to the Nazi party head

64
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.370
office in Berlin.
He was quickly promoted to the rank of hub shit Fiora.

65
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.700
I come in this job boys now to investigate and create reports on the activities

66
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:19.620
of Jewish organizations in Germany.

67
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.370
He threw himself into the work learning the basics of the Hebrew language and

68
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:27.990
establishing himself as the Nazi party expert on the culture and the history of

69
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:29.490
the Jews.
Around this time,

70
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.110
the perennially shy Eichmann met and fell in love with Veronica label after the

71
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:36.870
required vetting to ensure that she had no Jewish heritage.

72
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.670
The couple were married on March the 21st 1935 that would go on to have four

73
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:45.910
sons in 1937 like man who now held the rank of ss wound,

74
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:50.160
a storm for ra or second left tenants with sends on an important mission to the

75
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:53.640
British mandate of Palestine along with his superior officer.

76
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.930
He was there to investigate the feasibility of German Jews being forcibly made

77
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.240
to migrate to Palestine,
but the mission,

78
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:03.060
it never got off the grounds with the British refusing them entry into the

79
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:05.460
country and the week of the annexation of Austria.

80
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.960
I can move to Vienna with the job of organizing the local assets that his

81
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.870
efficiency in doing so earns him another promotion.

82
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.190
This time to the rank of SS obersturmfuhrer run or fast left tenants.

83
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.450
He was also selected to initiate the Central Office for Jewish emigration whose

84
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:26.220
express purpose was to force it.
The expulsion of all Jews from Austria

85
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.800
Eichmann throw himself into his new role with an unusual zeal.

86
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.551
Within eight months.

87
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:44.690
He had stripped the vast majority of Jews in the country of all their lands and

88
00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:48.320
their possessions and forced to 45,000 to leave.

89
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.310
I'm going to see a further 150,000 something disappeared.

90
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.990
His efficiency,
failure,
it greatly impressed to superiors.
The invasion,

91
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.560
Poland on September the first 1939 and the subsequent outbreak of war let's

92
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.620
policy towards the Jews changed.

93
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.740
No longer would they be encouraged to leave Germany from now on.

94
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.750
They would be forcibly deported.

95
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.370
Jews were to be herded together and sent it to concentration camps situated in

96
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.140
newly acquired parts of the Reich.

97
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.060
In October of 1939 I it was posted to Berlin where he works directly under

98
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:24.350
Gestapo chief Heinrich and Miller in establishing the nationwide central office

99
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.430
for Jewish emigration.

100
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.660
His first job was the clear specified areas of Poland's of juice.

101
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.531
At the same time,

102
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:34.850
he continued his past projects of ridding his beloved Vienna of the Jewish

103
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.743
problem.

104
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.130
He selected Nipsco when the far north of Poland as the site for a transit camp.

105
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.970
Whether you expelled Jews would be gathered before sending them to the harsh

106
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.030
Russian wilderness in order to fend for themselves.
Meanwhile,

107
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.810
ethnic Jews were being moved into the areas of Poland's where the Jews had been

108
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:55.520
evicted on December the 19th 1939 I then received,
yes,
another promotion.

109
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.660
He was now the overall coordinator of Jewish affairs and evacuation for the

110
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:01.370
entire German Reich,

111
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.050
all deportations to camps in Poland when now under his ultimate control,

112
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.950
many at thousands of Jews were also being sent to an area in the east of

113
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.470
Poland's,
known as the general governments.

114
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.880
I come in immediately dropped plans to send 600,000 Jews into the general

115
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:17.480
government,

116
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.350
but these plans were pushed back due to complaints by authorities in the east

117
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.740
who will worry that too many Jews would ruin the economy and the end,

118
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.360
some 63,000 people were relocated to the area with many of them dying and

119
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.670
transit all over occupied Europe.

120
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.480
Jews were crowded into ghettos as they waited to be sent away.

121
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.920
The conditions in the ghettos.

122
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.270
They were appalling and as many people died before they ever step foot on a

123
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:42.200
train carriage.

124
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.880
In 1940 Eichmann released a plan's resettle a million people every year and

125
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:49.490
Madagascar.
His plan had relied on the Luftwaffe,

126
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:51.560
a conquering the British and the battle of Britain,

127
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.890
which would have enabled the Germans do take control if the skies over the

128
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.430
Atlantic.
When this failed to happen,
the plans for operation Madagascar,

129
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.290
they were shelved in definitely,

130
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.360
and September of 1941 Oakland was called to a meeting with the head of the SD

131
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.841
Reinhardt Heidrich.
In this meeting,

132
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:21.160
he was informed that the fear had ordered that all Jews in countries occupied by

133
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:23.290
Germany were to be put to death.

134
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.310
The timeline for this was to swing into action off to the conquest of the Soviet

135
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:27.880
Union.
However,

136
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.300
the entry of the United States since the war following the Japanese attack on

137
00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:35.440
Pearl Harbor forced to rethink if this is the extermination of the Jews,

138
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.690
was to be given maximum priority.

139
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.720
In 1942 hydrate calls a meeting of the major players in the Nazi Organization of

140
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.830
[inaudible] on the outskirts of Berlin.

141
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.720
It was during this meeting that's an official policy of Jewish genocide was laid

142
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:53.620
out.
Heidrick calls it the final solution to the Jewish question.

143
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.290
I had prepared for this by creating lists of the numbers of Jews in each country

144
00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.940
who had to be exterminated.

145
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.480
Heidrick then appointed in his right hand man and man responsible for

146
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:07.590
coordinating all of the trains that would be used to carry Jews to Polish

147
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.670
concentration camps as a result of the constant supply of human fodder that

148
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:14.950
Eichmann was responsible for the death camps that outfits Sta.

149
00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:19.710
How Treblinka and book involved became 24 hour killing machines.

150
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.550
I can funnels Jews and Gypsies from Austria,
Holland,
France,

151
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.000
the Baltic states and Yugoslavia do that slaughter often.

152
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.860
They were sent first to Warsaw and other ghettos in Poland for resettlement for

153
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.050
the wrist and a gross example of distorted perception.

154
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.810
I can rate the following about his work jewelry.

155
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.200
It was grateful for the chance they gave it to learn community life at the

156
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.040
ghetto.
It made an excellent school for the future in Israel.
Basically,

157
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.900
most Jews feel well and happy and that ghetto life.
As the months passed,

158
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.560
the demands placed on [inaudible] and to speed up the killing machine increased.

159
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.740
He was responsible for supplying victims to a total of 164 camps spread

160
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.100
throughout Eastern Europe and attempts to make the process more efficient.

161
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.130
He oversaw the enlargement of the Dev trains still.

162
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.640
He gave no thought to supplying those who were crammed into the carriages for

163
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:13.641
weeks on end with food or water and many of them died on the way I Cummins.

164
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:18.360
Organizational ability was also employed to improve the efficiency of the actual

165
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.290
killing process.

166
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.520
He designs the huge windowless rooms and suggested that they be disguised as

167
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:25.980
shower units.
In order to allay panic.

168
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.000
He also pushed for the replacements of the relatively inefficient carbon

169
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:34.440
monoxide gas with the cyanide based insecticide.
It's like plumbing B.

170
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.820
We can get an insight into Eichmann's ruthless efficiency by an incident which

171
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:43.821
occurred during a roundup of Jews in Paris in 1942 7,000 people were rounded up

172
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.390
4,051 of them being children.
However,

173
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:52.470
the city powers objected to the deportation and has managed to secure talks with

174
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:56.520
Aikman.
The Jews were holed up in a warehouse without food or water.

175
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.080
For six days.

176
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.880
I come and stare down the French officials insisting that every single Jew had

177
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:04.920
to be sent east to their deaths.

178
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.920
In 1944 Eichmann was transferred to Hungary,

179
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:10.350
which had recently been overrun by the Nazis.

180
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.400
He was tasked with fast tracking the transportation of Hungarian Jews to death

181
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:17.910
camps,
something that he did with ruthless efficiency.

182
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.080
In just a few months he had condemns more than 400,000 of them.

183
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:37.150
Bye Ali and 1945 it was obvious to many in the Nazi hierarchy for the game was

184
00:11:37.151 --> 00:11:40.900
up with the Russians coming at them from one side and the allies closing in from

185
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:44.110
the other.
The priority for many became personal survival.

186
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.140
Reinhard Heidrick decided that the time had come to put an end to the mass

187
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:51.370
extermination of the Jews and set about destroying any evidence of the crimes

188
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:56.020
against humanity.
That had been,
when I come in,
heard about this,
he was not happy.

189
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.030
He decided of his own volition to continue and to even speed up the killings.

190
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.640
But finally,
even he saw the writing on the wall,

191
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.090
his biggest fear seem to be that he would be sent out to the front lines to

192
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:07.720
fight the Russian.

193
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.800
This of the Americans in March with the Russians pouring into a hungry,

194
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:15.250
he fled to Australia where he tried to get his old friend and it's Talton Bruna

195
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.440
to help him evade capture by the allies.

196
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.500
But at the ends of his involvements that Eichmann had had with the Jewish

197
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:23.470
slaughter had made him dangerous man to associate with,

198
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.430
and it's Colton Brennan who was trying to save his own skin once,

199
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:28.630
had nothing to do with him.
Surely thereafter,

200
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.960
Eichmann was captured by the U s army having given a false name.

201
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.050
He was transferred between several POW camps.
He was part of a work detail.

202
00:12:36.051 --> 00:12:37.960
Then charm and Germany.
When he escaped,

203
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.100
he managed to secure new identity papers and took on the identity of auto

204
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:46.030
Henning and he relocated to loon bag heath in Lower Saxony.

205
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.580
Eliza phones work in the forestry sector.

206
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.940
Other members of the Nazi hierarchy were not as fortunate as I come in in their

207
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:53.320
attendance to evade justice.

208
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.580
Many of them ended up at the Nuremberg war trials where they gave detailed

209
00:12:56.581 --> 00:13:00.010
evidence about the role that I came in and played and the systematic planning

210
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.620
and extermination of the Jews.
As a result of this,

211
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:07.340
he became one of the most sought after Nazi war criminals in 1950 Eichmann

212
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.230
relocated to Italy.
Yeah.
He received the assistance of Allahu doll,

213
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.550
a Roman Catholic bishop.

214
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:16.180
He was a Nazi sympathizer and had already helps many Nazis get out of Europe.

215
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.130
Huddle all helps Eichmann obtain a humanitarian passport from the International

216
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.710
Committee of the Red Cross along with fake identification and landing permits

217
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:25.690
for Argentina.
We think these documents,

218
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.320
he was able to secure an international passport from the Red Cross.

219
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.140
He now had everything you needed to sail for South America.

220
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.260
He departed from Genoa on June the 17th 1950 and arrived in Buenos Aires on July

221
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:38.434
the 14th

222
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.330
pull the next two years under the name of Ricardo Clemens Eichmann.

223
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.410
It worked for a government contractor in to come and province.
After two years,

224
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.840
he felt secure enough to bring over his wife and sons.

225
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.620
They moved to Buenos Aires where I came,

226
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.260
worked in a series of menial jobs before finding employment with Mercedes Benz.

227
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.030
Over the next few years he would employ,

228
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.170
has natural organizational skills to rise to the position of department.

229
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:15.460
Had beginning in 1956 and Neo Nazi fanatic began interviewing.

230
00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:19.690
I can manage this home with a goal of writing a fawning biography for this

231
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:22.120
project,
so large and damning collection of tapes,

232
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.850
transcripts and notes were produced.
Meanwhile,

233
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.960
a handful of determined his Nazi hunters.
We're hot on Aikman's trail.

234
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.960
Prominence among them was former concentration camp inmates,

235
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:36.670
Simon Wiesenthal in 1953 Weisen full that founds a postcard in which a former

236
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:41.140
Nazi victim had mentioned seeing that pig Eichmann and Buenos Aires.

237
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.470
He passed this information onto the Israeli consulate in Vienna,

238
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.860
the American CIA.
We're also aware of the type of man was in South America.

239
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.740
However,
they were unwilling to act on the information for fear of embarrassing

240
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:52.460
themselves.

241
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.180
In the postwar years the Americans and employed and number of Nazis do work on

242
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:57.860
the Manhattan atomic bomb project.

243
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.550
They didn't want to go near anything that would allow that information to leak

244
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.870
to the public.
Meanwhile,

245
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.710
why some full was working with the Israeli intelligence service massage to build

246
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:09.080
a picture of Eichmann's life in Argentina.

247
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.890
A break in the case came when Eichmann's second oldest son got involved with the

248
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:16.550
daughter of a Holocaust survivor who had relocated to Argentina.

249
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.420
The why the guns and boost that his father had worked for Hitler and was in fact

250
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.900
the brains behind is the final solution of the Jewish question.

251
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.710
The girl promptly reports and this information back to our father who in turn

252
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.660
informs the Israeli authorities.

253
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.740
Amazon sends an operative to Buenos Aires to confirm I Cummins location and his

254
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:34.490
identity.

255
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.020
It was now up to Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion to decide whether to

256
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:43.190
proceed diplomatically or to simply sees Eichmann and bringing back to Israel.

257
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.610
To face the music knowing that the Argentinians had a record of declining

258
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:49.130
extradition requests involving former Nazis.

259
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.520
Ben Gurion decided to take Eichmann by force.

260
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.300
An eight man team of Mossad operatives were send to Argentina to carry out the

261
00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:56.930
mission.

262
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.280
The operation was carried out on maybe 11th 1960 as Eichmann was walking home

263
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:05.030
from work to agents,
pretended to be working on a car or was he walks past.

264
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.450
A third agent approached and asked him for a cigarette.
I come in,

265
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:12.950
I demanded nervously and in that moment all three agents sprang upon him.

266
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.010
One of them,
a black belt in karate delivered a blow to his neck,

267
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.630
which rendered him unconscious.

268
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.140
Eichmann was bundled into a car and taken to a safe house where he was stripped

269
00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:23.330
naked and examiners under his right arm.

270
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:25.910
There it's the agents found a partially removed to tattoo,

271
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.880
which confirmed that he was a member of the SS on May the 21st day heavily

272
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.560
sedated Eichmann were smuggled out of Argentina on a commercial flight.

273
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.180
It was bound for Israel.

274
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.750
When Prime Minister Ben Gurion announced that the most wanted Nazi and the wells

275
00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:49.584
had been captured.

276
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.000
It caused an international sensation because the Argentinian strongly protested

277
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:55.860
the manner of the abduction claiming,

278
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.790
but it had been a violation of Argentinian sovereignty then Gloria and replied

279
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.750
that I can had been captured by agents of the Israeli government,

280
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.080
but by individual citizens that the trial of Adolf Eichmann,

281
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:10.770
it began on April the 11th 1961 in Israel's Beth Hon.

282
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.800
How's if the people 15 charges leveled against him,

283
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.570
including crimes against humanity?

284
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.740
The challenge encompass the view that he was the man in direct control of the

285
00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:22.140
entire Nazi bureaucratic structure,

286
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.400
responsible for the deaths of millions of people before and during the war.

287
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.940
I haven't.
This trial was broadcast live on TV stations around the globe.

288
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.750
After listening to the emotional testimony of Holocaust survivors and others

289
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.450
didn't try to deny the facts.

290
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.450
His soul defense was that he was simply carrying out orders.

291
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.440
He stated that he never did anything great or small without obtaining an

292
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:47.730
advanced express instructions.
Madoff,
Hitler or any of my superiors.

293
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.380
The trial took 14 at the end of which I commend was convicted on all counts.

294
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.580
The sentence was death by hanging his defense team made and unsuccessful appeal

295
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:00.180
for clemency,
which was turned down by the new Israeli prime minister.

296
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.220
The execution was carried out on June the first 1962 at Israel's rambler prison.

297
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.100
I couldn't refuse the black codes that was offered to him on the gallows.

298
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:12.960
His final words were long live Germany,
long live,
Austria,
long live Argentina.

299
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.160
