1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 16 he had a master plan for becoming one of the best,</v>

2
00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>no generalists in all of Britain.</v>

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>He's been in the midst of media scandals.</v>

4
00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>He's interviewed some of the most famous celebrities and most powerful</v>

5
00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>politicians in the world,</v>

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>and he's judged the talents of hundreds of common folks.</v>

7
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Arrogance,</v>

8
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>ambitious and shameless.</v>

9
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>who is this media man?</v>

11
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>of course it's none other than Piers Morgan.</v>

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.793
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.061
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

15
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Morgan was born in Sussex.</v>

16
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>That's in England in 1965 to an Irish dentist who unfortunately died when Morgan</v>

17
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 1>was only two years old.</v>

18
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Morgan was named peers.</v>

19
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.811
<v Speaker 1>Stephan,</v>

20
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh Mira.</v>

21
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>But Morgan's mother remarried after his father's death and Morgan,</v>

22
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>he adopted the surname cute Morgan Morgan and his stepfather.</v>

23
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>They were pretty close and Morgan having never really known as birth farmer</v>

24
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>calls Him Dad,</v>

25
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.381
<v Speaker 1>his parents,</v>

26
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>they weren't middle class English.</v>

27
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>They ran a pub and they supported Maggie Thatcher.</v>

28
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>When Morgan was 13 years old,</v>

29
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>the family could no longer afford to send him to private school,</v>

30
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>so he had to leave behind the classmates that he knew that his new school,</v>

31
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>he was picked on and in true schoolboy fashion,</v>

33
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>the name Q,</v>

34
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>well that was changed to puke.</v>

35
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>They are hilarious,</v>

36
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>aren't made Morgan,</v>

37
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.031
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

38
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>he dropped few from his name later on.</v>

39
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe that some have attributed to a desire to separate from his middle</v>

40
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:26.934
<v Speaker 1>class roots.</v>

41
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>That's that Morgan himself just said was because p Morgan was too long for a</v>

42
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>byline as a Charles Morgan.</v>

43
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>He showed an early affinity for the media as early as age seven he would sit at</v>

44
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>the table devouring the daily newspapers,</v>

45
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>reading the headlines and discussing the day's events with his parents.</v>

46
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

47
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was a teenager,</v>

48
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>he was already writing news articles,</v>

49
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>even actually sold a piece to the mid Sussex Times and then do cricket magazine</v>

50
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>at the age of 2014 he said,</v>

51
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>if this,</v>

52
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>it gave me the real taste of the excitement of a byline.</v>

53
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It's probably no surprise to youth and that a couple of years later when it was</v>

54
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>time for a career to happen,</v>

55
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Morgan had set his mind on the fact that he would become the most famous media</v>

56
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>personality in all of Britain.</v>

57
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>He developed this master plan and ops is not to take an offer from Warrick</v>

58
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>university to study history.</v>

59
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>The reason for this was simply because this would have kept his master plan or a</v>

60
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>hold for a few years while he completed his education.</v>

61
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So instead he went directly to Harlow college and don't have it into the formal</v>

62
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>study of journalism as soon as he could.</v>

63
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

64
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Wilkins first formal journalism Gig,</v>

65
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>was it the south London News and then he joined the sun's right,</v>

66
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:39.254
<v Speaker 1>the gossip column,</v>

67
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>which was entitled,</v>

68
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>bizarre as The Guardian put it.</v>

69
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Morgan spent his years at the sun,</v>

70
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>grinning in namely,</v>

71
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>while posing next to a succession of personalities.</v>

72
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

73
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>wasn't disagree with the Guardian's characterization.</v>

74
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>It was an initial years in the media as he himself told the BBC,</v>

75
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>he made a point of putting himself in the middle of stories,</v>

76
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>posing for pictures with celebrities and generally his name has face out there</v>

77
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.130
<v Speaker 1>for all of Britain.</v>

78
00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And to see while this tactic,</v>

79
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it totally works.</v>

80
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.320
<v Speaker 1>By 1994 at the age of only 20 million Morgan securities place in British media</v>

81
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

82
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>When Rupert Murdoch named him as editor of the news of the world's Piers Morgan,</v>

83
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.410
<v Speaker 1>he was the youngest editor ever of the news of the world.</v>

84
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And as the youngest editor of a paper in Britain in five decades,</v>

85
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>the news of the world had the largest circulation of any paper in the country at</v>

86
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

87
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And the editor Shep gave Morgan a platform in which to put his hard charging,</v>

88
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>oft controversial journalistic methods on display for a huge population of</v>

89
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>readers even held reach,</v>

90
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the previously untouchable barricade of the royal family.</v>

91
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>By the summer of 1994 Princess Diana and Prince Charles is marriage ed was on</v>

92
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>its way to its official ends and Oregon and the news of the welds.</v>

93
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>They weren't going to miss out on the opportunity to publish on potentially</v>

94
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>juicy Ronald scandals.</v>

95
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Wolgan his court wins that James Hew as an officer in the British military</v>

96
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>wanted to spill the beans about his affair with Princess Diana with no fear of</v>

97
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>potential repercussion or for the long held level of dignity with which the</v>

98
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>roles had been treated.</v>

99
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Morgan reached down to it and arranged to interview him for a story.</v>

100
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>He and his associate,</v>

101
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>they actually even bugs the room where they did the interview so they would have</v>

102
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>absolute proof of everything that was set.</v>

103
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Then leads to that year in the fall,</v>

104
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>a book about Prince Charles and his private life.</v>

105
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>It was set to be published while the news of the worlds that they didn't have</v>

106
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>any excerpts the Sunday Times.</v>

107
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Totally did Morgan well.</v>

108
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't ready to give a scoop to another paper and nausea willing to take no</v>

109
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>as an answer when he was denied access to information from the Sunday Times.</v>

110
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

111
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.080
<v Speaker 1>he directed Rebecca back of Seward,</v>

112
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>helps him out on the hotel interview to disguise herself,</v>

113
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>sneak into the Sunday Times officers,</v>

114
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>grab a copy and get it back to the news of the world as quickly as possible.</v>

115
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>this a little bit of espionage.</v>

117
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It totally worked.</v>

118
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And the news of the world,</v>

119
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>they were able to publish the story about Diana and Charles all long before any</v>

120
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>other paid the except for the Sunday Times.</v>

121
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>So if Piers Morgan wanted to be a really famous journalists,</v>

122
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean why did he settle for running gossipy relationship stories?</v>

123
00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the answer was because to him everything was news.</v>

125
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>There is a type of snobbish pompous journalist who thinks that the only news</v>

126
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>that has any validity is war,</v>

127
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>

128
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 1>pestilence or politics.</v>

129
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't come from that school,</v>

130
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>this egalitarian attitude.</v>

131
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>It's allowed Morgan too quickly prove as metal and his willingness to do</v>

132
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>whatever it took to be successful in breaking stories that he only lasted at the</v>

133
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>news of the world for a bit over a year.</v>

134
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Though Morgan said he left the publication of his own accord.</v>

135
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>The timing of his exec coincide with the publication of a photo of Princess</v>

136
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Diana's sister in law leaving and addiction treatment clinic.</v>

137
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>The publication of which even Rupert Murdoch said went too far now in 1995</v>

138
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>shortly after this photo around Morgan,</v>

139
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>he moved on to head up the mirror and other paper roads by Rupert Murdoch here</v>

140
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.040
<v Speaker 1>has tenure.</v>

141
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>It lasted much longer than it did at the news of the world.</v>

142
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>The number of controversial stories though it was much larger than man as a</v>

143
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:50.501
<v Speaker 1>result,</v>

144
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.730
<v Speaker 1>his profile but continued to rise even outside of Britain,</v>

145
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.551
<v Speaker 1>but it's true to form.</v>

146
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It only took a year before Morgan found himself in his first major controversy</v>

147
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.014
<v Speaker 1>at the mirror.</v>

148
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>The day before England was set to play Germany and the euro 96 football</v>

149
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>championships.</v>

150
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>The Mirror ran a headline and the folks when it's front page that many did not</v>

151
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.870
<v Speaker 1>find very amusing above a doctored image of two players wearing world war two</v>

152
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>helmets was the headliner act will not surrender for you.</v>

153
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:21.041
<v Speaker 1>Fritz Zero 96 championship is over next to it was a letter written by Morgan</v>

154
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>himself in the style of Neville Chamberlain.</v>

155
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Reportedly Morgan also plans a publicity stunt than involved driving a tank to</v>

156
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>the German embassy.</v>

157
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>In the ensuing uproar about the headline,</v>

158
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>well that lead to stunt,</v>

159
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>it was subsequently canceled.</v>

160
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly though Morgan,</v>

161
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>he found himself in this position that is hard charging personality.</v>

162
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem suited for you.</v>

163
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Got to apologize.</v>

164
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.821
<v Speaker 1>There were fears,</v>

165
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>the kind of attitude you promoted by the headlight made site acts of violence</v>

166
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.970
<v Speaker 1>during the games though Morgan,</v>

167
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>he was apologizing.</v>

168
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>He was still right where he wants it to be and of course that would be the</v>

169
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>center of attention.</v>

170
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>In 2000 though,</v>

171
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>the attention turns from an editorial decision he had made to a more personal</v>

172
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:57.720
<v Speaker 1>financial scandal.</v>

173
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

174
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>These in newspaper published the story alleging that Morgan had bought 20,000</v>

175
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>pounds worth of stock in a computer company and that he had made the purchase</v>

176
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 1>just before the mirror ran a piece naming the stock as a good buy and inquiry</v>

177
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>began and it was just to hit the wall and Morgan had breached an ethical code of</v>

178
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 1>conduct.</v>

179
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>He could keep his job.</v>

180
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Other mirror employees,</v>

181
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

182
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>they weren't so lucky.</v>

183
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Economist,</v>

184
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>so you wrote on stock vice,</v>

185
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>they lost their jobs and it was another four years before Morgan was cleared of</v>

186
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>any wrongdoing.</v>

187
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.781
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

188
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>it actually came out later that he'd bought additional stock under his wife's</v>

189
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>name and another 70,000 pounds worth by the time that that later revelation came</v>

190
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:31.091
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

191
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>it was Morgan was already on the skids at the mirror.</v>

192
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I just said he had been leading the charge against the Iraq war in the British</v>

193
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>press,</v>

194
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.360
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly criticizing then Prime Minister Tony Blair for his support.</v>

195
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:40.641
<v Speaker 1>Supportive.</v>

196
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>The ball among the story is published on the war and the Morgans leadership was</v>

197
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>a piece that included a photo of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners.</v>

198
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 1>As recently as eight 2016 BBC Interview Oregon,</v>

199
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>he defended the photos seeing if they were real and that the British government</v>

200
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>had a vested interest in getting rid of me.</v>

201
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Their biggest thorn in the side about the war.</v>

202
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.741
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

203
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the mirror,</v>

204
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>it didn't defend them strongly in the wake of the allegations that they were</v>

205
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>actually fake.</v>

206
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.081
<v Speaker 1>The British people.</v>

207
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:06.501
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

208
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>they actually got a paper with a large headline that that stage,</v>

209
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

210
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>we will host and then the man who had,</v>

211
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.151
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

212
00:08:12.151 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>the publication of the photos,</v>

213
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

214
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>he was subsequently out of a job when Morgan's firing was announced to staff</v>

215
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>members at the paper.</v>

216
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>They were in tears after nearly a decade.</v>

217
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Piers Morgan's reign of the Daily Mirror.</v>

218
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.743
<v Speaker 1>It was over.</v>

219
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

220
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 1>free to form though.</v>

221
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>He absolutely did not slink away into the night.</v>

222
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.791
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

223
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>he became a regular feature on people's TV screens that we had already been</v>

224
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 1>appearing on TV before leaving the newspaper business.</v>

225
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Morgan stepped up his involvement with broadcast media after it's firing.</v>

226
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the first offers Morgan received for a regular TV Gig was via a text</v>

227
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>message from signing cow and then in 2000 and America welcomed Morgan into their</v>

228
00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>homes as he served as a judge on America's got talent.</v>

229
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>You also judge Britain's,</v>

230
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:01.411
<v Speaker 1>got talent,</v>

231
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>and even appeared on the Venn,</v>

232
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.301
<v Speaker 1>just a mogul.</v>

233
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Donald trumps reality show the celebrity apprentice Morgan actually won his</v>

234
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>season of the celebrity apprentice and in the process became close friends with</v>

235
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>now President Donald Trump.</v>

236
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Orkin said all along that he believed to Trump would be president and just being</v>

237
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>outspoken about his dislike for the protests that erupted after Trump's</v>

238
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

239
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.641
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

240
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Morgan style trines on the subject of even that some celebrities do decline</v>

241
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.164
<v Speaker 1>interviews with him,</v>

242
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:25.801
<v Speaker 1>but Morgan,</v>

243
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 1>he knew what opening his mouth could lead to.</v>

244
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>He's no stranger to the INS and outs of the American political and media</v>

245
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.274
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

246
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>He served as the host of eight primetime show on CNN for several years after</v>

247
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

248
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>So when Larry King announced his retirement in 2010 Morgan was named as the</v>

249
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>replacement for the long time.</v>

250
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>My chronic American host,</v>

251
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

252
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>it started strong with Morgan able to book some of the biggest names in media</v>

253
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and politics for interviews.</v>

254
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:48.991
<v Speaker 1>Oprah,</v>

255
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:49.824
<v Speaker 1>Rudy Gilani,</v>

256
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.401
<v Speaker 1>Ricky Gervais',</v>

257
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.211
<v Speaker 1>Condoleezza Rice,</v>

258
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>and even two of the con ashy and sisters bands.</v>

259
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:54.181
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

260
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>he made just as many headlines for the interviews he didn't do as well.</v>

261
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Madano was deemed too old to appear on his show and his bands from ever being a</v>

262
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>guest,</v>

263
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's unfortunately for Morgan,</v>

264
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the initial hype,</v>

265
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>it wore off quickly.</v>

266
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Morgan had a different style from king and he was a British person taking over</v>

267
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>in American news and interview show.</v>

268
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately he lost it.</v>

269
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Be Three years in the host chair has poor ratings.</v>

270
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Student into failure is attributed to the you failure to a clash of cultures</v>

271
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>citing such factors as his own outspoken opposition to guns as one such example</v>

272
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>of cultural differences that just couldn't be bridged.</v>

273
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>The CNN show though it wasn't Morgan's only projects during that time period.</v>

274
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 1>It was also hosting life stories for like TV,</v>

275
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>who subjects were as diverse as Sharon Osborne and the prime minister.</v>

276
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And now today he's the permanents cohost for good morning Britain where he keeps</v>

277
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:41.430
<v Speaker 1>himself in the spotlight,</v>

278
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>mostly recently sparring with a gender fluid guest over the validity.</v>

279
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:48.590
<v Speaker 1>You have gender fluidity in this interview and it's pretty classic blunt style.</v>

280
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.950

308
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 1>The FBI then opens their own investigation into the news of the world and the</v>

309
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>allegations that they were hacking the phones of nine 11 victims.</v>

310
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

311
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>this scandal was so wide ranging that even London's police department was</v>

312
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 1>investigated for corruption.</v>

313
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

314
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

315
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.631
<v Speaker 1>the scandal,</v>

316
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:12.620
<v Speaker 1>it's totally envelop to England.</v>

317
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>The wells,</v>

318
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it was paying attention though Morgan had been out of the newspaper world for</v>

319
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:17.831
<v Speaker 1>some time.</v>

320
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 1>He was not immune to being questioned about the scandal.</v>

321
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:20.771
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

322
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 1>he had to answer questions regarding to the voicemails.</v>

323
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 1>If one of England's most famous personas,</v>

324
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.430
<v Speaker 1>so Paul Mccartney,</v>

325
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Mccartney,</v>

326
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.791
<v Speaker 1>his ex wife,</v>

327
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:28.451
<v Speaker 1>Heather Mills,</v>

328
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>had alleged that her voicemails have been listened to after she and Mccartney</v>

329
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:36.781
<v Speaker 1>had had a fight in 2001 a reporter who called her just seem to know too much and</v>

330
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Mel's maintain that she hadn't shared the voicemails with anyone else and that</v>

331
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>she had actually deleted them all.</v>

332
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>The only way the reporter could have known so much was if he had hacked or</v>

333
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 1>listen to the voicemails or talk to someone who hat Morgan and it that he had</v>

334
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 1>heard a message from Mccartney to mills and as a result he was called to testify</v>

335
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 1>and the 2011 inquiry into phone hacking,</v>

336
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Morgan wouldn't reveal how it come to hear the message and he also maintains</v>

337
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.550
<v Speaker 1>that he never authorized the hacking of voicemails or the news of the welds or</v>

338
00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:02.384
<v Speaker 1>the Daily Mirror,</v>

339
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 1>the head of the phone hacking inquiry,</v>

340
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Lord Levison Goldberg and his testimony that he didn't know about the phone</v>

341
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 1>hacking to be utterly unpersuasive as well.</v>

342
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Despite his denials of direct involvement in the hacking Morgan.</v>

343
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:18.871
<v Speaker 1>He was interviewed by the police about the hacking in both 2013 and 2015</v>

344
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.453
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

345
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.051
<v Speaker 1>Phone hacking,</v>

346
00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>incendiary headlines,</v>

347
00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:32.780
<v Speaker 1>taping interviews about the royals,</v>

348
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.380
<v Speaker 1>your might thing that would be enough for any one person to face in the course</v>

349
00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:37.340
<v Speaker 1>of a media career.</v>

350
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.330
<v Speaker 1>But Piers Morgan,</v>

351
00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Speaker 1>he has been embroiled in personal controversy with other celebrities as well.</v>

352
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.260
<v Speaker 1>One much publicized dramas,</v>

353
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:47.150
<v Speaker 1>diameter and action Morgan took is the editor of the Daily Mirror.</v>

354
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.710
<v Speaker 1>He published photos of top gear host Jeremy Clarkson with a woman who was not</v>

355
00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:52.544
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

356
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Clarkson and understandably was perturbed by these photos being put out there</v>

357
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:57.200
<v Speaker 1>for all of the world to see.</v>

358
00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:01.400
<v Speaker 1>So what did parks and do well and he decided to her glass of water in Morgan's</v>

359
00:14:01.401 --> 00:14:04.850
<v Speaker 1>face that's might not seem out of place in your average bar.</v>

360
00:14:04.851 --> 00:14:05.511
<v Speaker 1>That on board,</v>

361
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.100
<v Speaker 1>the last flight of the Conchords,</v>

362
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.240
<v Speaker 1>the alteration,</v>

363
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

364
00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>it stood out and the fact that it was between two,</v>

365
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you are highly visible members of the British media.</v>

366
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.160
<v Speaker 1>We're all even better a fuse between these two men.</v>

367
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

368
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.590
<v Speaker 1>it's officially started and this feud,</v>

369
00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:19.371
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't minor thing.</v>

370
00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It literally came to blows in 2004 when Clarkson punched Morgan in the head at</v>

371
00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:25.430
<v Speaker 1>the national press awards.</v>

372
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Parkson broke a finger.</v>

373
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Morgan gained discard ans these celebrity gossip writers.</v>

374
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

375
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.290
<v Speaker 1>they gained a new story though the views linger for a few years.</v>

376
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>The two men were able to bond over drinks in 2015 and while the feud end it at</v>

377
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:38.061
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

378
00:14:38.061 --> 00:14:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Clarkson was going through a divorce and confided about his travels to Morgan</v>

379
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.980
<v Speaker 1>who was able to empathize.</v>

380
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I sensed that Jeremy's just pretty much like every other 50 something in life.</v>

381
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Angst-Ridden from damage,</v>

382
00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:49.071
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

383
00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:49.491
<v Speaker 1>grieving,</v>

384
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 1>loved ones,</v>

385
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>irritated by work issues and battling in a demons.</v>

386
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

387
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.510
<v Speaker 1>well at the time he entered his fifties Morgan was acquainted with many of the</v>

388
00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:09.390
<v Speaker 1>same trials and tribulations that Clarkson had dealt with.</v>

389
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.200
<v Speaker 1>His own marriage fell apart by the mid two thousands when he had his first wife</v>

390
00:15:13.201 --> 00:15:18.060
<v Speaker 1>and married and shallow officially divorced in 2008 after 27 years of marriage,</v>

391
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:18.810
<v Speaker 1>the marriage,</v>

392
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.680
<v Speaker 1>it produced three sons and Morgan makes a point of staying in close contact with</v>

393
00:15:22.681 --> 00:15:23.310
<v Speaker 1>his children.</v>

394
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.761
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

395
00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:25.620
<v Speaker 1>amidst all of the demands on his time,</v>

396
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Oregon has made a point of speaking to his children every single day.</v>

397
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Often is divorce Morgan.</v>

398
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.690
<v Speaker 1>He began dating Celia walls in a fellow journalist,</v>

399
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the couple the married in 2010 and years later they had a daughter.</v>

400
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.970
<v Speaker 1>They both are British.</v>

401
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.240
<v Speaker 1>They now primarily reside in New York.</v>

402
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Walden often shares details of their married life in her columns and Morgan even</v>

403
00:15:45.421 --> 00:15:48.960
<v Speaker 1>joins in some of the time the team even teams up to write a column about a trip</v>

404
00:15:48.961 --> 00:15:52.740
<v Speaker 1>to Paris in which Morgan steps back from his desire to be known by everyone.</v>

405
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Ferris has always been one of my favorite cities because the French neither knew</v>

406
00:15:55.861 --> 00:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>who I am nor camp.</v>

407
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.590
<v Speaker 1>This means I can behave in a wildly reckless manner and to maintain a reasonable</v>

408
00:16:01.591 --> 00:16:05.340
<v Speaker 1>confidence that the shameful images will never appear on the cover of the</v>

409
00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:06.450
<v Speaker 1>national enquirer.</v>

410
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Though he claims he doesn't want his own personal shame.</v>

411
00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Shout in the national enquirer,</v>

412
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Morgan has made a career out of sharing the intimate details of other people's</v>

413
00:16:25.141 --> 00:16:25.680
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

414
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.980
<v Speaker 1>He's never been shy about sharing his political opinions or any opinions.</v>

415
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.390
<v Speaker 1>He's made a name for himself.</v>

416
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.040
<v Speaker 1>He's made a few enemies along the way and shows absolutely no sign of stepping</v>

417
00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:36.930
<v Speaker 1>out of the spotlight anytime soon.</v>

418
00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:38.310
<v Speaker 1>From Middleclass Sussex.</v>
