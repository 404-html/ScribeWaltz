1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>He is revered as one of the greatest artists of all time.</v>

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.580
<v Speaker 1>For centuries is typifying into the perfect artistic genius.</v>

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>His greatest legacy is the surviving works that we can see today.</v>

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>The Sistine Chapel,</v>

5
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>the statue of David,</v>

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>yet behind the artworks law is a complex and stubborn man,</v>

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and in this week's biographics,</v>

8
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>we go beyond the facade to discover the real Michael Angelo,</v>

9
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Italy in the 15th century.</v>

10
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It was very different to the country that we know today.</v>

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.951
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

12
00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>it was a collection of small republics.</v>

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>These city states were all under the governorship of the pope who was located in</v>

14
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Rome.</v>

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>The key republics were Florence,</v>

16
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:53.801
<v Speaker 1>Genoa,</v>

17
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>and Venice.</v>

18
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Every state I didn't.</v>

19
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Certain governors,</v>

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>it's nobles,</v>

21
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.731
<v Speaker 1>peasants,</v>

22
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>priests,</v>

23
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.721
<v Speaker 1>imams,</v>

24
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>government officials nestled in the remote app and nine mountains of central</v>

25
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Italy was the small village of Capri seat.</v>

26
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It was here on March the sixth,</v>

27
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:06.431
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

28
00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:06.971
<v Speaker 1>75.</v>

29
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The Franciscan Deniro,</v>

30
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Buena Rossi gave birth to her second son,</v>

31
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

32
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>her husband's a lot of etsy.</v>

33
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Does.</v>

34
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo,</v>

35
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.921
<v Speaker 1>we are not used to.</v>

36
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Mooney was a lonely official who had the job of convicting and sentencing</v>

37
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>criminals when baby Michael Angelo was six months old,</v>

38
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>the family of four moved to Florence here,</v>

39
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Itso,</v>

40
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>so bought a small farm near the village of set.</v>

41
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.563
<v Speaker 1>In your note,</v>

42
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it was in this village and the child spent his early years under the care of</v>

43
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>wetness farming off newborns do a wetness for the first few years of life was a</v>

44
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>common practice at that time.</v>

45
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>The women who took in Michelangelo was married to a stone cutter in later years</v>

46
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 1>when he had transformed himself into a sculptor.</v>

47
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo commented that he had drunk model dust with his nurses milk when he</v>

48
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>was three.</v>

49
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo returned to live with this family in Florence.</v>

50
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>The family was poor rams with new babies arriving frequently.</v>

51
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>The household was overcrowded.</v>

52
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of ECO received a migo government salary,</v>

53
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>and his farm wasn't very successful.</v>

54
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

55
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>he believed that the work of a lowly farmer was beneath him when he was six</v>

56
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.071
<v Speaker 1>years of age,</v>

57
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>young Michelangelo's tough life got even tougher.</v>

58
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>His mother died leaving behind five young sons,</v>

59
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.670
<v Speaker 1>including a newborn.</v>

60
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Ludovico,</v>

61
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 1>did his best working two jobs and still managing to trundle the boys off to mass</v>

62
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>at the Church of Santa Croce and Florence every Sunday.</v>

63
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>This church was filled with magnificent works of art,</v>

64
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>including a crucifix carved by the famous sculptor,</v>

65
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Donatello and wall paintings by he auto,</v>

66
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest artists of all time.</v>

67
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>The young Michelangelo must have marveled at these magnificent pieces.</v>

68
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>In 1485,</v>

69
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ego took a new wife,</v>

70
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>lucrezia deadly eldine.</v>

71
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Gagliano came from a rich family bringing 600 floor into the union as a dowery.</v>

72
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>This was an enormous amount at the time and it flips to the fortunes of the</v>

73
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>family overnight and immediate result of the family's newfound wealth was that a</v>

74
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 1>lot of ego was able to afford to send as Michelangelo to a Latin school to learn</v>

75
00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>

76
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.761
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

77
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and mathematics,</v>

78
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>but boy soon proved that he was no academic boards with his lessons.</v>

79
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>He would stare out of the window while doodling on paper.</v>

80
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.941
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

81
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>one thing he did fall in love with was poetry,</v>

82
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>returning home for vacation,</v>

83
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

84
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.210
<v Speaker 1>he told his father that he was more interested in art than in academic studies,</v>

85
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.700
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of ego was not impressed at that time.</v>

86
00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Artists were the lowly paid servants of noblemen being considered less or more</v>

87
00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>than a servant's Ludovico wanted his son to aspire to.</v>

88
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.433
<v Speaker 1>More than that,</v>

89
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>the only person who seemed to understand Michelangelo's passion for us was an</v>

90
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.360
<v Speaker 1>older boy that he had befriended by the name of Francisco Gren Artsy Francisco</v>

91
00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:47.420
<v Speaker 1>himself was a budding artist apprentice do the famous artists,</v>

92
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Dominica,</v>

93
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.141
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

94
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:48.974
<v Speaker 1>and diary.</v>

95
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.550
<v Speaker 1>He took them Michelangelo to his Master's workshop and showed him works in</v>

96
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:53.180
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

97
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.820
<v Speaker 1>The younger boy was mesmerized by what he saw.</v>

98
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 1>He knew that being an artist was his destiny.</v>

99
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Despite his father's negativity,</v>

100
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo kept begging to be allowed to pursue his passion.</v>

101
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

102
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 1>his friend Francisco encouraged him to produce some drawings,</v>

103
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.580
<v Speaker 1>which he showed to his master Galleon dire.</v>

104
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>The great artist was impressed and expressed the desire to also take</v>

105
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo on.</v>

106
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>There's an apprentice.</v>

107
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.671
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

108
00:04:16.671 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>lots of ECO relented under the age of 12.</v>

109
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>His son became apprentice to gallon diode the most around the most successful</v>

110
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:25.850
<v Speaker 1>artists workshop in Florence along with his two brothers.</v>

111
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>They were kept busy decorating chapters in Florence.</v>

112
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>The brothers had a number of apprentices aged between eight and 15 who lived</v>

113
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:35.060
<v Speaker 1>with them and assisted with paintings and murals.</v>

114
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.661
<v Speaker 1>The parents,</v>

115
00:04:35.661 --> 00:04:36.530
<v Speaker 1>including Ludovico,</v>

116
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.850
<v Speaker 1>had to pay for living expenses and for training from the Ugandans your brothers</v>

117
00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>young Michael Angelo learns how to prepare a wooden panel for painting and how</v>

118
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.600
<v Speaker 1>to plaster a wall in preparation for the painting of a fresco.</v>

119
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.620
<v Speaker 1>He was also taught how to make working drawings called cartoons,</v>

120
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.470
<v Speaker 1>which would form the basis of finished paintings</v>

121
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>among the apprentices.</v>

122
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo was an immediate standout.</v>

123
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

124
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>He proved to be stubborn and it's quite full of himself.</v>

125
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>He was given the task of copying works previously drawn by his master and having</v>

126
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>done so declared that his works were better than the originals gallons.</v>

127
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I acknowledged that the boy had great talent,</v>

128
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>but he was angered by his pride for attitude.</v>

129
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>They also saw that Michelangelo lacked the patients needed to learn some of the</v>

130
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>skills required such as painting frescoes.</v>

131
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>He showed little interest in grinding and mixing paints,</v>

132
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't be bothered mixing the ingredients needed for the smooth plaster</v>

133
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>needed for fresco painting when he was 14,</v>

134
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo went one step too far.</v>

135
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>He had copied some drawings that his master had done of women,</v>

136
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>but then he did to correct some finer aspects of the originals by going over</v>

137
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>them with a broad NIB pen.</v>

138
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>This was too much gallons.</v>

139
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Io kicked Michelangelo out of the workshop claiming that there was no teaching</v>

140
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>this no at all.</v>

141
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Rather than being discouraged,</v>

142
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>the talented team made the decision that paints and pasta went off for him.</v>

143
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>He considered them to be a lesser form of art to him.</v>

144
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>The real skill lay in stone producing fine sculptures of the human form.</v>

145
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>This desire would take them to the very pinnacle of Florentine Ability.</v>

146
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>The house of Medici</v>

147
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.460
<v Speaker 1>before Michelangelo had been dismissed by Gulen diode,</v>

148
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.460
<v Speaker 1>some members of the Medici family visited the workshop.</v>

149
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Among them was an elderly sculptor named Beto.</v>

150
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Did Giovanni.</v>

151
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 1>This man,</v>

152
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.550
<v Speaker 1>notice the talents that Michelangelo possessed and struck up a relationship with</v>

153
00:06:38.551 --> 00:06:39.220
<v Speaker 1>a boy.</v>

154
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Often his dismissal.</v>

155
00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:43.030
<v Speaker 1>The budding young sculpture sought out the old man,</v>

156
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.150
<v Speaker 1>but older was employed by Lorenzo de Medici,</v>

157
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:47.890
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful man in the city.</v>

158
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>He was making statues,</v>

159
00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:51.400
<v Speaker 1>medals for the man and looking after his art collection.</v>

160
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Many of Lorenzo statues were displayed in a golden artists.</v>

161
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Went to drawer and carve.</v>

162
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>This area was a gathering place for students,</v>

163
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.740
<v Speaker 1>sculptors who would get feedback and instruction from a whole day about their</v>

164
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:03.310
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

165
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Soon,</v>

166
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo was a regular in the garden.</v>

167
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>The now 15 year old began creating sculptures from clay and bringing them to the</v>

168
00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

169
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 1>They was younger than the other.</v>

170
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Budding is.</v>

171
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.190
<v Speaker 1>His skill was clearly beyond this.</v>

172
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 1>This lead to jealousy sometimes and even lead to physical violence in one</v>

173
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>encounter.</v>

174
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

175
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.430
<v Speaker 1>even at his nose broken that the boy he was not deterred begging a piece of</v>

176
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>marble from another sculptor.</v>

177
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.430
<v Speaker 1>He created his first relief carving the head of a foreign just as he had been</v>

178
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:30.731
<v Speaker 1>hoping.</v>

179
00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:34.690
<v Speaker 1>This sculpture was seen by Lorenzo de Medici who was immediately taken with the</v>

180
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>boys skill.</v>

181
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.420
<v Speaker 1>He brought Michelangelo into his fold,</v>

182
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.970
<v Speaker 1>giving him his own room and paying him an allowance.</v>

183
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>The young artist's life was now more peaceful.</v>

184
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.390
<v Speaker 1>He was able to settle down to the task of perfecting his chosen art form.</v>

185
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 1>One of his first major projects was to convert a scene from mythology on model</v>

186
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>as a relief panel.</v>

187
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>This was the battle of the centaurs.</v>

188
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.610
<v Speaker 1>These creatures with the heads and arms of men and the bodies of horses gave him</v>

189
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.070
<v Speaker 1>plenty of scope to show action and form.</v>

190
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 1>The realism and gentle precision of this work is remarkable for a sculptor of</v>

191
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:05.890
<v Speaker 1>such a young age.</v>

192
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>The other major piece that Michelangelo produced while working in the house of</v>

193
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Medici was a relief panel called Madonna of the steps.</v>

194
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It shows the Virgin Mary nursing the infant Jesus.</v>

195
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.250
<v Speaker 1>The piece is carved on fine white model and shows the madonnas face in profile</v>

196
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>as she holds her infant son against her.</v>

197
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Things were going remarkably well for the 17 year olds and he was living in the</v>

198
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:31.210
<v Speaker 1>inner sanctum of the richest family in the city and he had a powerful patron who</v>

199
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:32.200
<v Speaker 1>admired his talents.</v>

200
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

201
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.420
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the last.</v>

202
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.321
<v Speaker 1>In April 14,</v>

203
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:35.741
<v Speaker 1>92,</v>

204
00:08:35.741 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Lorenzo suddenly died.</v>

205
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 1>His son pro took over,</v>

206
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but he can't let off a sculpture.</v>

207
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.290
<v Speaker 1>He gave Michelangelo no work until the winter when you decided that he would</v>

208
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 1>like a snowman made.</v>

209
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 1>He ordered Michelangelo to make one.</v>

210
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.500
<v Speaker 1>It would prove to be the artists strangest condition.</v>

211
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Around the same time the prior of Santo Spirito asked the young sculptor to a</v>

212
00:08:55.231 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>crucifix for his church to license with the results of the prior gave Michael</v>

213
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Angelo the use of a room in which he could work.</v>

214
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>He was able to dissect corpses in order to study anatomy.</v>

215
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind this was,</v>

216
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:07.351
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

217
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>to make the most lifelike sculptures of the human body possible.</v>

218
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He believed that in order to know how to make these sculptures,</v>

219
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>he had to know how the human body was put together.</v>

220
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.661
<v Speaker 1>The US.</v>

221
00:09:16.661 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>He actually became one of the first.</v>

222
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>People do dissect and study.</v>

223
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>The human body in this way,</v>

224
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.690
<v Speaker 1>by 1494,</v>

225
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Florence was facing a crisis and army lads buying King Charles the eighth of</v>

226
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:39.470
<v Speaker 1>France was it the walls and was threatening to overrun the city.</v>

227
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.281
<v Speaker 1>Many people,</v>

228
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>including Michelangelo,</v>

229
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.433
<v Speaker 1>fled the city.</v>

230
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He traveled to the Lanya in northern Italy and Venice and important trading</v>

231
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:47.564
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

232
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo.</v>

233
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.550
<v Speaker 1>He hoped to find work.</v>

234
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

235
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>he could not find any employment,</v>

236
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.810
<v Speaker 1>so he went back to behlen.</v>

237
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

238
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>nothing lost his patron.</v>

239
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo set out in search of a replacement.</v>

240
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>He found it in the form of San Francisco,</v>

241
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.090
<v Speaker 1>outer vandy or your local Nobel and politician.</v>

242
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll prevent the set,</v>

243
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:06.020
<v Speaker 1>his talented new sculpture to the task of carving the missing fingers of the</v>

244
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:06.501
<v Speaker 1>unfinished,</v>

245
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:09.800
<v Speaker 1>trying of send them Monica in the church at the same name again.</v>

246
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Michael Angelo,</v>

247
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>now 20 had fallen on his feet.</v>

248
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He enjoyed a comfortable home,</v>

249
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>had stone and supplies provided and received commissions for his artwork.</v>

250
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Just as it happens in Florence.</v>

251
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:21.320
<v Speaker 1>This bred resentment among other sculptors.</v>

252
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.101
<v Speaker 1>They paid rent,</v>

253
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:25.370
<v Speaker 1>sports tools since stone and survived out of their own pockets.</v>

254
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.291
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

255
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:37.124
<v Speaker 1>back in Florence,</v>

256
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.500
<v Speaker 1>a change of power had a cut.</v>

257
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.680
<v Speaker 1>A priest by the name of [inaudible] Savonarola had instigated a fierce campaign</v>

258
00:10:42.681 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 1>against the house of Medici.</v>

259
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.100
<v Speaker 1>When the threats of French invasion hurt emerged,</v>

260
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.660
<v Speaker 1>the house of Medici had fled.</v>

261
00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:50.720
<v Speaker 1>The city leaving Savonarola for you to take power.</v>

262
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.170
<v Speaker 1>This strict churchmen disapproved of paintings and sculptures that showed the</v>

263
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:55.100
<v Speaker 1>naked human body.</v>

264
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

265
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>prospects were not good for local sculptors.</v>

266
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.971
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

267
00:10:58.971 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 1>in 1495,</v>

268
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo felt a great urge to our town,</v>

269
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:03.590
<v Speaker 1>to Florence to see his family.</v>

270
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.490
<v Speaker 1>While then he made contact with some members of the house of see now living</v>

271
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.450
<v Speaker 1>under false names,</v>

272
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.000
<v Speaker 1>one of them Lorenzo DPF,</v>

273
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Francisco de Medici wanted Michael Angelo to help him sell a statute that he had</v>

274
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:15.044
<v Speaker 1>made earlier.</v>

275
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 1>It was a figure of the Roman God of Love Cupid.</v>

276
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 1>If the statue was aged to look like an ancient statue,</v>

277
00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Lorenzo reasons,</v>

278
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.360
<v Speaker 1>it would make a lot of money in Rome.</v>

279
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo is smeared the statue with deaths to make it look as if it had been</v>

280
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 1>buried.</v>

281
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Even took the forge dan deep to Rome,</v>

282
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.380
<v Speaker 1>where it was purchased by a senior judgment calls and our re Reo.</v>

283
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.411
<v Speaker 1>While in room Michael,</v>

284
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Angela was introduced to some powerful people,</v>

285
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>including members of the board,</v>

286
00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:40.100
<v Speaker 1>your family who numbered among them the pope,</v>

287
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and he was well aware that Michelangelo was really the creator of cupids quickly</v>

288
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.200
<v Speaker 1>commissioned him to create another statue for his collection.</v>

289
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.130
<v Speaker 1>The statue that resulted has come to be recognized as Michelangelo's</v>

290
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece,</v>

291
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>the statue of Bacchus,</v>

292
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the Greek god of wine and celebrations.</v>

293
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

294
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Although everyone else was impressed,</v>

295
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the cardinal was not.</v>

296
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 1>He thought of the Gods looked too drunk and refuse to pay for the work.</v>

297
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Michael Angelo now had to fight to get paid for a job that he had already</v>

298
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>completed.</v>

299
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>On top of this,</v>

300
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>he received news that his father had fallen into bad financial straits.</v>

301
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>What do you need it and fast.</v>

302
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It was a new patron to support not just himself,</v>

303
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>but also his family.</v>

304
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>For several months,</v>

305
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>nothing seemed to pan out for the 21 year old master sculptor.</v>

306
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.560
<v Speaker 1>He was without a patron.</v>

307
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>He was without payments for his back,</v>

308
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>his statue,</v>

309
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 1>and just follow the was in desperate need of financial assistance.</v>

310
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Then in November of 14,</v>

311
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 1>97 things to contend for the best at,</v>

312
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it was conditioned to produce an exciting new work by a French ambassador by the</v>

313
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.420
<v Speaker 1>name of Cardinal Zone.</v>

314
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Bill had to like grow that and envisioned a statue of the Virgin Mary cradling</v>

315
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 1>the dead Jesus subject known as the piano.</v>

316
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.860
<v Speaker 1>It took Michael Angelo two years to complete the theater,</v>

317
00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 1>but it was worth it.</v>

318
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 1>The finished work was displayed in the Vatican and everyone who saw it was</v>

319
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>amazed at the realism of the flesh and fabric that the sculptor had fashioned</v>

320
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 1>from the cold model.</v>

321
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 1>The psm made Michelangelo's famous now the most powerful men in Europe who were</v>

322
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 1>clamoring to have him work for them.</v>

323
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It seemed as if as money,</v>

324
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>whereas we're finally behind him</v>

325
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.511
<v Speaker 1>back in Florence,</v>

326
00:13:26.511 --> 00:13:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the scene have changed once again on a railroad.</v>

327
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.820
<v Speaker 1>The priesthood fallen into disfavor and it's been executed.</v>

328
00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

329
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It was now safe for artists to return and to pursue projects that the</v>

330
00:13:35.811 --> 00:13:37.580
<v Speaker 1>authorities of the Florentine Cathedral,</v>

331
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 1>the guns of,</v>

332
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.440
<v Speaker 1>formulates the idea to commission a giant statue of the biblical killer of</v>

333
00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Goliath,</v>

334
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.490
<v Speaker 1>young David to sculptors had already been commissioned to do the job.</v>

335
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Both had failed,</v>

336
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>merely managing to make the huge block of marble almost unusable in 50.</v>

337
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:51.591
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

338
00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:54.140
<v Speaker 1>The job was given to Michelangelo in order to do the job,</v>

339
00:13:54.141 --> 00:13:56.840
<v Speaker 1>these sculptor had to stop working on another job in Romans,</v>

340
00:13:56.841 --> 00:13:57.920
<v Speaker 1>relocate to Florence.</v>

341
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.970
<v Speaker 1>This blessing from one project to another became a common practice and one that</v>

342
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:04.310
<v Speaker 1>created frequence legal ramifications.</v>

343
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.270
<v Speaker 1>The creation of Davis was an immensely challenging and lengthily Joel.</v>

344
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.050
<v Speaker 1>The first decision was to choose the pose that fitted in with the way the marble</v>

345
00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.100
<v Speaker 1>had already been worked.</v>

346
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.160
<v Speaker 1>This prevented him from emulating the traditional pose,</v>

347
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.070
<v Speaker 1>which showed David standing with Goliath had his feet,</v>

348
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.820
<v Speaker 1>so therefore he decided to do depict David's in the moments before the fight,</v>

349
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.950
<v Speaker 1>as if it was looking upon his phone.</v>

350
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.760
<v Speaker 1>His next move was to surround the huge piece of marble with barricades.</v>

351
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Then you went to work.</v>

352
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.030
<v Speaker 1>He tirelessly chipped away at the giant.</v>

353
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

354
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the statue of David was completed.</v>

355
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a triumph with crowds lavishing praise on the creator of the 14 foot nude</v>

356
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:40.580
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

357
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.200
<v Speaker 1>The man who had commissions,</v>

358
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.730
<v Speaker 1>the work pro to arena and ruler of Florence was also impressed that he told</v>

359
00:14:46.731 --> 00:14:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Michael Angelo the David's nodes was do brought the sculptors.</v>

360
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Stubborn pride now came to the but it was tempered with common sense,</v>

361
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>taking a handful of marble dust.</v>

362
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>He climbed up the scaffolding and pretended to chisel the nose,</v>

363
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>even let the dust falls to the ground.</v>

364
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Soderini declared that the nose was now much better</v>

365
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:13.961
<v Speaker 1>in 50,</v>

366
00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:14.490
<v Speaker 1>93,</v>

367
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.600
<v Speaker 1>a new Pope Julius.</v>

368
00:15:15.601 --> 00:15:17.040
<v Speaker 1>The second was elected in Rome.</v>

369
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Julius had great artistic ambitions and he knew who he wanted to spearhead the</v>

370
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.190
<v Speaker 1>many projects he had in mind,</v>

371
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and this of course was Italy's greatest sculptors.</v>

372
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

373
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo had the skills needed to do justice to the greats.</v>

374
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Theocratic works that the pope and visions Julius knocked down the unstable</v>

375
00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>fifth century basilica of Saint Peter's and the Vatican,</v>

376
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's began rebuilding the chapter on a much grander scale.</v>

377
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.960
<v Speaker 1>The centerpiece was to be his own tomb,</v>

378
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.540
<v Speaker 1>which would be designed and carved by Michelangelo.</v>

379
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.590
<v Speaker 1>This massive project was intended to show the greatness of Julia says both the</v>

380
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Pope and also as a patron of the arts.</v>

381
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It was to be three stories high and covered in life size sculptures.</v>

382
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.980
<v Speaker 1>The sculptures spent the first eight months just querying the marble needed for</v>

383
00:15:58.981 --> 00:15:59.814
<v Speaker 1>the projects.</v>

384
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.400
<v Speaker 1>It would prove to be his most frustrating project,</v>

385
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.850
<v Speaker 1>one on which he would work on and off for the next 40 years.</v>

386
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.400
<v Speaker 1>In the end of the finished tomb was smaller than plans,</v>

387
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.900
<v Speaker 1>but still vast.</v>

388
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Only three of the statues were by Michelangelo,</v>

389
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.350
<v Speaker 1>the large bearded Moses and the biblical characters of Rachel and Leah,</v>

390
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and instead of being placed in some pizzas,</v>

391
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.850
<v Speaker 1>it was put in the much less grands.</v>

392
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Church of San Pietro.</v>

393
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Four years into the tomb projects,</v>

394
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Pope Julia set his sights on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican.</v>

395
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.050
<v Speaker 1>The ceiling was painted with a pattern of gold stars,</v>

396
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>but the pope envisions something far grander.</v>

397
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Even though Michelangelo was known as a sculptor and painter,</v>

398
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the pope chose him to do the work.</v>

399
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.630
<v Speaker 1>The great sculptor had not worked on a fresco since his days as an apprentice</v>

400
00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:45.900
<v Speaker 1>back in Florence bars back in the day when the pope chose you for a job,</v>

401
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.620
<v Speaker 1>you did it,</v>

402
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but that did not mean that you have to do it willingly.</v>

403
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.061
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

404
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:52.650
<v Speaker 1>he considered himself to be a slave to the whims of the pope.</v>

405
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.570
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a balance of the painting project.</v>

406
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>This is not my profession.</v>

407
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I am wasting my time and all for nothing they got helped me.</v>

408
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a massive job.</v>

409
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The chapel ceiling covered a curved surface of about 5,600 square feet.</v>

410
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 1>That's 507 square meters.</v>

411
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:08.971
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

412
00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:13.170
<v Speaker 1>these ceiling has an uneven surface and it was 60 feet above the chapels floor.</v>

413
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.130
<v Speaker 1>The pope commissioned the artist to fill this canvas with scenes from the Old</v>

414
00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Testament's.</v>

415
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo plans out name,</v>

416
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 1>scenes taken from the book of Genesis.</v>

417
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.890
<v Speaker 1>The centerpiece would be the creation of Adam for for pain staking years.</v>

418
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo worked on the ceiling.</v>

419
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It was backbreaking work.</v>

420
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 1>The figures were designed to be seen from the floor,</v>

421
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.980
<v Speaker 1>but the artists had to paint high up on the scaffolding lying on its back.</v>

422
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.320
<v Speaker 1>According to his official biographer on dv,</v>

423
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.580
<v Speaker 1>he works on his own,</v>

424
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.690
<v Speaker 1>applying the plaster,</v>

425
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.650
<v Speaker 1>mixing the colors,</v>

426
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.060
<v Speaker 1>and doing all the painting,</v>

427
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the results.</v>

428
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.040
<v Speaker 1>They were breathtaking.</v>

429
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.940
<v Speaker 1>The use of perspective and the dramatic rendition of the figures were admired by</v>

430
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 1>everyone who saw them.</v>

431
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Having triumphantly completed the assisting chapel project.</v>

432
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo returns to his work on the tube of Julius when Pope Julius died in</v>

433
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:57.481
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

434
00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>

435
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 1>The urgency I went out to the projects in 15,</v>

436
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:01.141
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

437
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:01.651
<v Speaker 1>the new pope,</v>

438
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Leo the 10th asked Michelangelo to design a new facade for the Church of San</v>

439
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Lorenzo in Florence.</v>

440
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 1>There we had no experience.</v>

441
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 1>That's an architect's.</v>

442
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 1>The sculptor was confident that he could do a good job.</v>

443
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.250
<v Speaker 1>He throw himself into the projects,</v>

444
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 1>buying a piece of land near the church in order to work on his facade,</v>

445
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but then in 15,</v>

446
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

447
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>the project was put on hold and then cancel altogether.</v>

448
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

449
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 1>he was furious.</v>

450
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 1>He had invested himself fully,</v>

451
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 1>both physically and financially into the project.</v>

452
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Partly to placate him,</v>

453
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>the pope gave him a replacement projects the MEDICI tombs to be created in</v>

454
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>remembrance of two members of the family who had died prematurely.</v>

455
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo began work on the Medici Chapel and 50 19 two,</v>

456
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 1>which was added to the library a few years later.</v>

457
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Both buildings took years to complete and are stunning designs.</v>

458
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>The artist was now at the height of his creative power,</v>

459
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.640
<v Speaker 1>but crisis was just around the corner.</v>

460
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.241
<v Speaker 1>In 15,</v>

461
00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:06.020
<v Speaker 1>27 armies from France and the holy Roman Empire invaded Italy.</v>

462
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Rome was looted and burned by now.</v>

463
00:19:08.391 --> 00:19:09.470
<v Speaker 1>There was yet another pope,</v>

464
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 1>claimants the seventh,</v>

465
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.470
<v Speaker 1>and he sided with the holy Roman Empire.</v>

466
00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:13.750
<v Speaker 1>When it besieged Florence,</v>

467
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.663
<v Speaker 1>a loyal Florence,</v>

468
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo returns home to defend this city.</v>

469
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.390
<v Speaker 1>He set to work designing new fortifications to help protect the city.</v>

470
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That's his efforts were in vain.</v>

471
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.600
<v Speaker 1>After a long struggle,</v>

472
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 1>the city fell with many people being killed.</v>

473
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

474
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.680
<v Speaker 1>he went into hiding,</v>

475
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.430
<v Speaker 1>concealing himself in a tiny crypt onto the ultra.</v>

476
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.880
<v Speaker 1>If the Medici Chapel in Santa Renzo very states until the news came through that</v>

477
00:19:34.881 --> 00:19:36.800
<v Speaker 1>the pope had no animosity against him.</v>

478
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo spends his latter years writing poetry and continuing to work for</v>

479
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the pope's in Rome.</v>

480
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.920
<v Speaker 1>One of his most famous poems describes how uncomfortable he was when painting</v>

481
00:19:55.921 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the Sistine Chapel ceiling bends almost double with paint splashing on his face</v>

482
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 1>as he aged.</v>

483
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 1>He wrote more poems of a religious nature throughout the reign of several pipes.</v>

484
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.340
<v Speaker 1>He held the position of chief architects of some peters.</v>

485
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

486
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>he works on carvings that were variations of the work that had fast propels him</v>

487
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 1>to fame,</v>

488
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 1>the PSL.</v>

489
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It was while working on one of his pieces on February the twelfth,</v>

490
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:17.431
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

491
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 1>64 that he began to feel feverish you took to his bat,</v>

492
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.200
<v Speaker 1>and despite the efforts of his doctors,</v>

493
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 1>he died six days later.</v>

494
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 1>His dying wish was to have his body returned to Florence,</v>

495
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.960
<v Speaker 1>the city that he loved.</v>
