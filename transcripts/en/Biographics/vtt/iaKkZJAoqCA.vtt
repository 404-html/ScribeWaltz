1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.360
He was one of the world's most notorious and ruthless leaders.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.201
Since coming to power.

3
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:08.940
In 1979 Saddam used any means necessary to hold onto Iraq,

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.630
including killing anyone who stood in his way at a young age.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.180
He was brutalized at home,
ran away to his uncles,

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.970
and quickly became a thug for an extremist political party.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.070
As he rose through the ranks and took over,

8
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.730
he modernized the country and rules through fair.
Eventually,

9
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.020
his greed defines and murderous ways.
Let him to the gallows.

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.310
Today on biographics,
we learned about the life of Iraq's former presidents,

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.510
Saddam Hussein.

12
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.240
On April the 28th 1937 Saddam Hussein was born to a peasant,

13
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:54.740
women in a modern Straw village.

14
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:58.280
Goals our near to Chris on the banks of the Tigris river,

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.050
so darn bore the physical marks of his tribe on the rest of his right hands at

16
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.450
our two of three dark blue dots.

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.480
Most people in this village lived in severe poverty and life was very difficult,

18
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.790
so the arms father,
his sheep herd a disappeared before he was born.

19
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.640
Then a few months later said arms.

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.410
12 year old brother died from cancer or this scent.

21
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.940
Saddam's mother suffer into a crippling depression and she attempted to abort

22
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.380
unborn baby and to kill herself.
She failed and when her infant son was born,

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.930
she named him Saddam,
which means in Arabic,

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.830
the one who confronts or the stubborn one without a husband.

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.260
Soon Dylan's have the means to support our baby.

26
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.060
She sends it on to live with a brother,

27
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:42.200
Kai Rolla to laughy retired army officer and is Arab nationalist and to Chris

28
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.710
[inaudible] lives with him only three years until it's alpha was in prison due

29
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.600
to his part in a coup to overthrow the pro British governments in Iraq.

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.170
By this time said I'm his mother had remarried,
a man named Abraham Hassan.

31
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.040
Villagers knew him as Hassan for Leia back at his mother's home,

32
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:02.010
the young Saddam and do regular beatings and maltreatment of the hands of a

33
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.670
stepfather,
neighbors,
and early friends of Saddam.

34
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:08.600
Recall Hassan beating him to wake him in the morning and regularly shouting

35
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.360
things like you,
son of a dog out,
don't want you.

36
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.410
He was forbidden from going to school and instead was made to be useful by

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.390
stealing goats and chickens for the family.

38
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.530
If Saddam was caught stealing it has been said he would rather poison the

39
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:25.180
animals then return them to their owners.
At the age of 10 Saddam Dom,

40
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.760
his uncle had been released from prison as he fled to to Chris to be with him.

41
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.290
Topher filled the boy with dreams of glory saying he would be a great leader of

42
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.800
Iraq.
Someday you're going to have to sit on his first real possession.

43
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.060
And that was a hand gun.

44
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.350
So dom reportedly use the weapons threats in his primary school teachers and he

45
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:45.980
may have murdered a man and he was not even a teenager.
According to the story,

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.310
after the killing,
police showed up at [inaudible] house and founds it,

47
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.980
I'm sleeping with the gun,
still warm under his pillow,

48
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.370
under his uncle's cat was finally able to go to school,

49
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:59.560
but he lands much more than how to read,
how to write through the years.

50
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.930
He was deeply influenced by Kalfas politics.

51
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:06.280
And after leaving the [inaudible] secondary school in 1957 at the age of 20 so

52
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:10.870
dom drawings the Arab about half socialist party as a low level thug and gunman.

53
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.890
The party was formed in Syria in 1947 with the ultimate goal of unifying the

54
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.800
various Arab states in the Middle East.

55
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.420
At the time it was the most radical nationalist party in Iraq and did it become

56
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.790
an underground revolutionary force,

57
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.850
but he was 22 Saddam played a major role in the Ba'ath Party.

58
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.590
His assassination attempts of the Ven Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Karim Qassim.

59
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.420
During the attack on October the seventh 1959 Saddam and other assassins

60
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.630
ambushed Cassim's car on Baghdad's busiest street.

61
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.550
The prime minister minister's a chauffeur was killed,

62
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.480
but the prime minister was sped surviving gunshot wounds in the arm and
shoulder,

63
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.910
so they'll escapes with a bullet in his leg.

64
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.110
The official version of the story portrays it on as a hero who dug the bullet

65
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.530
out with a pen knife and other versions suggests to the plot fails because

66
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.220
Saddam opened fire prematurely.
Several of the would be assassins.

67
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.940
They were caught,
tried and executed,
but Saddam was not.

68
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.750
He managed to flee to Syria before eventually seeking refuge in Egypt.

69
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.530
While in Egypt,
studied law at the University of Cairo.

70
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.680
Saddam returned to Iraq in 1963 after a successful military overthrow of cosines

71
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.920
governments.
After his returns was recruited for yet another assassination,

72
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.910
the Ba'ath party at suffered from infighting and the coup was plans to overthrow

73
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:29.470
the leader.
The plan,
however,
was betrayed and Saddam became a wanted man.

74
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.910
He was forced into hiding,

75
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.510
but was caught and in prisons in 1964 while he was in prison,

76
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.890
he remains active in party politics and read up on his role models tyrants like

77
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.270
Joseph Stalin and Hitler.
In 1966 Saddam escaped prison,

78
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.040
thanks to the help of sympathetic prison gods.
Afterwards,

79
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200
he was appointed deputy secretary of the regional commands and became a rising

80
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:52.180
star in the bar off organization.

81
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.090
In 1968 another successful coup in Iraq puts it down as but AAFP party in power

82
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.120
and precedents.
Ahmed Hassan,
our backer,

83
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.180
Saddam's cousin named him deputy head of the secret police.

84
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.500
Saddam proved to be a ruthless but effective politician within governments.

85
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:21.010
He either eliminated or cooperatives individuals seem stood in his wife.

86
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.710
Eventually he clawed his way to become the vice president of Iraq's

87
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.290
revolutionary command council,
the RCC,
the core group that held Iraq's behalf,

88
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.370
this government together,

89
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.870
although not the official presidents of Iraq rock until 1979 so though I'm Trudy

90
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.420
held the reins from the early 1970s onwards.

91
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.550
When the Ba'ath party it seized control.

92
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:42.370
It did not enjoy widespread support across the country.

93
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.440
That changed after Saddam nationalized Iraq's oil industry in the early 1970s

94
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:50.970
before the energy crisis of 1973 as a result,

95
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.270
the nation enjoyed a boon to the economy and as the massive earnings allow the

96
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.500
back office to governments to fund health,

97
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.610
education and public works sectors and expand social programs.

98
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.680
In an attempt to wipe out illiteracy,

99
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.120
Saddam required all children to attend school and made it free through high

100
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.670
school.
He also provided free hospitalizations,

101
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.500
all the Rockies and full economic support to the families of Iraqi soldiers.

102
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.880
Such reforms were unheard of in any other Middle Eastern country in the years

103
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.881
before.

104
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.881
The Iran Iraq war construction became one of the prized occupations of Iraq is

105
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.903
middle class.

106
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.820
It is also important to note that 40% of the increased revenue from oil to

107
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.100
buying armaments from western and Soviet suppliers,

108
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.130
that figure increased at the onset of the war with Iran in 1979 when our back,

109
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.610
our attempt to to your night Iraq and Syria in a move that would have left

110
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.170
Saddam effectively powerless,

111
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.370
Saddam forced albacore to resign and on July of 16 1979 Saddam Hussein became

112
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.080
president of Iraq.
Five days later,

113
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.720
he calls him assembly of the Ba'ath party consisting of roughly 250 people.
Now,

114
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.050
the meeting party officials saft mystified as Saddam made the announcement that

115
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:07.190
he had uncovered a plot against him and he claims the conspirators were in that

116
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.990
very room and alleged informants then read a list of 68 names out loud and each

117
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.810
person was promptly arrested and removed.

118
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.220
Every single one of these individuals was eventually tried and found guilty of

119
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.830
prisoner 22 of them were sentenced to death.

120
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.130
The whole ordeal was films and circulated around Iraq.

121
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.220
This was an intentional well scripted display of Saddam is power and to clear

122
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:33.410
message of who was in charge.
Three months later,

123
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.770
Saddam declared 14 people up to 13 of the Jews,

124
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.080
part of a Zionist aspiring.

125
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.800
He made a very public carnival like display out of their execution,

126
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.000
stringing them up before a crowd of thousands in downtown Baghdad.

127
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.200
Over the next several months,

128
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:52.710
Saddam had more plotters murders on television and he hung them up on the city's

129
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.740
lampposts to guard against coups and ensure loyalty surrounded himself with his

130
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:01.520
Ken putting his fellow Klansman in government positions.

131
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.930
He regularly used informance and it's the secret police to route out a suspected

132
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:09.230
conspirators.
If anyone so much has made a joke about Saddam,

133
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.920
they could have that tongue caught out or even pay with our life.

134
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.330
He believed it was better to murder a person of suspicion and be wrong than it

135
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.700
was to not and then be killed by them.

136
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.710
<v 0>Does it all married his first cousin,
so his uncle TALF his daughter,</v>

138
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.850
that five children,

139
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.750
including two sons who day and [inaudible] as well as three daughters.

140
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.400
Rock out runner Holler.

141
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.430
He took on mistresses but did not parade them around publicly.

142
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.990
Later on when his sons grew up,

143
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.710
he gave them high ranking positions within the Iraqi government to Dom's public

144
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.890
image was meticulously crafted.
He dyed his hair black,

145
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.040
sported a mustache and refuse to wear his reading glasses and that's in private.

146
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.260
He had a slight limp due to a slipped disk,

147
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.740
so he was never filmed walking for more than a few steps.

148
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.460
He was six foot tall and his weight fluctuated from trim to Chubby,

149
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.210
but as well tailored suits were made to disguise is protruding valley.

150
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.830
Each of his 20 palaces was kept fully staffed with meals prepared dany as if he

151
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.110
were in residence to disguise his whereabouts.

152
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.860
He moved around frequently and to use the body doubles to 40 assassination

153
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.090
attempts.
His meals,

154
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.560
she delicacies like imported lobster were first tested for radiation and then

155
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:29.760
poison.
His wine of choice was the Portuguese rosay but he never drank in public.

156
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.580
Do you maintain the conceit that he was a strict Muslim?

157
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.430
Saddam was particularly phobic about germs and even top generals,

158
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.171
someone to meet him.

159
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:40.340
What often order to strip down to their underwear and it's their clothes were

160
00:09:40.341 --> 00:09:43.680
then washed arms and the x rayed before they could get dressed to see him.

161
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.520
They also had to wash their hands and disinfections during his imprisonment and

162
00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:51.330
just said he would try to maintain this loneliness by wiping his utensils and

163
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:54.540
food tray with baby wipes before eating throughout his rule,

164
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.680
he maintains a limited worldview and possessed little knowledge of western

165
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.260
culture laws and advancements in technology.

166
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.100
He was once shocked to learn there was no such law in the u s that prevented

167
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:07.710
citizens from complaining about the presidents.

168
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.630
They'll sign you that Saddam anointed himself,
presidents of Iraq.

169
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.320
Iran is Ayatollah Khomeini that day.
Successful Islamic revolution.

170
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.400
So Darren's political power rested in part upon the support of Iraq's minority

171
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:33.560
sunny populace,
and he worried the developments and Shiites minority Iran,

172
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.790
because need to a similar uprising in Iraq and response on September the 20

173
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:42.350
seconds 1980 so dom ordered Iraqi forces to invade the oil rich region of

174
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:46.220
Kazakhstan stone and Iran,
a clear violation of international law.

175
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.890
The conflict seems,
turns into an all out war.

176
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.700
One Saddam foolishly expected would be over in a matter of weeks.

177
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.650
Saddam had no prior military experience and he grossly underestimated his enemy.

178
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.540
Iran was three times the size of Iraq and to formidable opponents a stalemate

179
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.920
and sued with both sides engaged in bloody trench wolf that at the same time at

180
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:10.940
ground troops with deadlocked sit on some millions of dollars into developing

181
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:11.840
nuclear weapons.

182
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.310
In 1981 Israel took this matter seriously believing that if Saddam had the

183
00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:19.940
ability that would be no preventing him from dropping atomic bombs on their

184
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:21.140
cities.
In June,

185
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:24.770
the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq's research center or rentals.
Eric,

186
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.180
at least 25 pounds of enriched uranium were reported to have been on site.

187
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.280
The plants was near completion and scheduled to begin operations within a matter

188
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.340
of months.

189
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.110
The destruction of Iraq's nuclear plants was humiliating and with no end in

190
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:39.944
sight to the war.

191
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.440
Saddam consultant as cabinets in the meeting said Mom's health minister

192
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:47.480
suggested that he stepped down in order to form a ceasefire with Iran.

193
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.620
As the story goes,

194
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.340
said I'm thanked him for his cancer ends then had him arrested on the spot.

195
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.200
The minister's deeded with Saddam to release our husbands since he promised that

196
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:56.650
he would,

197
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.790
when he was sent home the next day he was delivered in a black canvas body bag,

198
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.930
cut up into tiny pieces in the closing days of the war with Iran.

199
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.920
Saddam's murderous ways reached new heights and it's most savage act.

200
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.520
He poisoned thousands of civilian Kurds using chemical gases,

201
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.000
killing upwards of 5,000 people and injuring 10,000 mall.

202
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.860
The genesis of what became known as the Halabi Gymnastica or bloody Friday,

203
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.930
Iranian photographer,
caviar Golstein witness the gas attacks from a helicopter.

204
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.330
He stages it was life,

205
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.150
frozen life had stops like watching a film and suddenly it hangs on one frame.

206
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.130
It was a new kind of deaf to me.

207
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.330
The off time off requests victims were still being brought in.

208
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.220
Some villages came to our shopper.

209
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.630
They had 15 or 16 beautiful children begging us to take them to hospital.

210
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.350
So all the press sat there,
and as we were each handed a child to carry,

211
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.483
as we took off,

212
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.990
fluids came out of my little girl's mouth and she died in my arms.

213
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.030
One decades after the attack,

214
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:59.740
at least 700 people were still being treated for severe after effects of this

215
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:00.430
massacre.

216
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.730
So these have concluded that the Kurdish population in this region that suffer

217
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:07.090
from a higher percentage of medical disorders,
birth defects,

218
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:10.570
and various diseases,
including cancers and heart disease.

219
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.350
On August the 20th 1988 after years of intense conflicts,

220
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.750
the left half a million casualties on each side.

221
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.150
A ceasefire agreement was finally reached.

222
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.570
The ATO war ravaged Iraq's economy and infrastructure.

223
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.630
1 million Iraqi soldiers were out of work at the ends of the 1980s so dom turned

224
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:30.970
his attention towards Iraq's wealthy,
neither Kuwait,

225
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.120
Saddam believed that the Kuwaitis had a $200 billion in various bank accounts

226
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:36.964
around the world,

227
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.570
and to takeover of this small country would yield him all the riches he needed

228
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:44.920
to pay back Iraq's ward out and stabilize this country using the justification

229
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:47.230
that Kuwait was historically a part of Iraq.

230
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.320
Saddam ordered the invasion on August the second 1990 it took only at six hours

231
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.470
for Saddam's armies to occupy the country and move greatly condemned around the

232
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:57.100
wells.

233
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.450
The UN Security Council resolution was prompted me past imposing sanctions and

234
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:06.430
setting a deadline of January the 15th of 1991 for the Iraqis to leave Kuwait

235
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.570
during the occupation.

236
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.830
So dom stage day number of bizarre televised interviews with citizens of key

237
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:15.190
ways in which he asked them if they were happy with the Iraqis invasion.

238
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.330
And of course in all of these interviews they said absolutely because they

239
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.020
didn't have a choice when's it on ignored?
The January the 15th deadline,

240
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.420
a coalition force headed by u s presidents,

241
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:28.240
George Hw Bush confronted Iraqi forces.

242
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.440
Saddam was no match for America's far power and modern warfare technology.

243
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.160
Within just six weeks,
Saddam's troops were out of Kuwait.

244
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.640
A ceasefire agreement was signed,
the terms of which included rock,

245
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.490
just man's Lincoln's germ and chemical weapons programs.

246
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.990
The previously imposed economic sanctions levied against Iraq remains in place.

247
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.230
Despite this and the fact that his military had suffered a crushing defeat and

248
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:55.910
estimated 150,000 Iraqis died.
So I'm claimed victory in the conflict.

249
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.990
He calls the mother of all battles his biggest victory and the maintains that

250
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:04.790
Iraq had actually repulsed and attack by America and it's criminal gang.

251
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.150
He says Iraq has punched a hole in the myth of American superiority and it to

252
00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:14.150
the nose of the United States and the dust during the 1990 various she items

253
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:15.980
Kurdish uprisings in Iraq occurred,

254
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.150
but the rest of the world fairing and other war did little or nothing to support

255
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.960
these rebellions and as they were ultimately crushed by Saddam's forces.

256
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.530
At the same time,
Iraq remains under intense international scrutiny.

257
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.000
Saddam violated the terms of the USP steel when inspectors were sent into a
rock.

258
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:36.050
They found him destroyed stockpiles of weapons including chemical and biological

259
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:40.340
warheads and a super gun with missiles capable of reaching Israel.

260
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.940
The inspectors also alleged Saddam was still at work at developing nuclear

261
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:48.941
weapons in 1993 when Iraqi forces violated a no fly zone imposed by the UN.

262
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.030
The United States launched a damaging missile attack on Baghdad.
Further strikes.

263
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:54.710
Okay.
I didn't.

264
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.030
1998 with economic sanctions still in place in the years following the Gulf War.

265
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.511
Saddam,

266
00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:03.560
it continued to maintain his personal wealth and his family's wealth through

267
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.580
selling oil and medical supplies meant for his people on the black market.

268
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.880
While the citizens of Iraq,
we're in dire straits,

269
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.450
he built opulent palaces and has maintained his lifestyle

270
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.350
after the terrorist attacks on the US.

271
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.100
On September the 11th 2001 President George W.

272
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.820
Bush and members of his administration suspected Saddam's governments of having

273
00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:37.360
a relationship with a solid lardons Alica your organization.

274
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.680
They also suspected him of possessing weapons of mass destruction and is

275
00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:45.670
January,
2002 state of the Union address,
President Bush named Iraq,

276
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.020
part of his so called axis of evil along with it wrong and it's North Korea.

277
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.590
Later that year,
you and inspections of suspected weapons sites began.

278
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.310
There's little or no evidence that such programs existed was actually found

279
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:02.370
despite this on march the 20th 2003 under the pretense that Iraq did in fact

280
00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:05.560
have a covert weapons program and that it was planning attacks.

281
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.170
A US led coalition invaded Iraq.

282
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.470
Within weeks the government and military had been toppled.

283
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.700
And on April the ninth 2003 backed out fell to the Saddam.
However,

284
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.540
he managed to a you'd capture in the month that follows and intense search for

285
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:21.280
Saddam began.
While in hiding,

286
00:17:21.281 --> 00:17:25.120
Saddam released several audio recordings in which he denounced Iraq's invaders

287
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.250
and called for resistance.
Finally,

288
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.750
on December the 13th 2003 so dom was found hiding in a hole in the ground in a

289
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:36.340
bunker near a farm house and add door near to create the ones well dressed and

290
00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:40.480
groomed.
Leader looks the Shovels Unshaven and bewildered.
When he was arrested.

291
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.530
Saddam was moved to a US base in Baghdad where he would remain until June the

292
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:49.380
30th 2004 when he was officially handed over to the interim Iraqi government to

293
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:53.010
stand trial for crimes against humanity with his day's numbered,
so dominant,

294
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.100
showed no accountability or remorse for his crimes.

295
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.840
In 2003 when Austin by Iraqi politicians about his brutal acts,
Saddam Coles,

296
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.030
the Heloc Jerry attack Iran was handiwork,

297
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.990
said the Kuwait was rightfully a part of Iraq and is that the mass graves were

298
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:09.360
filled with thieves who fled the battlefields.
