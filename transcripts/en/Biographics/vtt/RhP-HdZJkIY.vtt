More about that a bit later on,
but for now,
let's just get on with it.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.010
Henry Ford was an American success story through his dog,
perseverance,

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
engineering,
brilliance,
and innovative production techniques.

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.670
He brought an affordable motor vehicle to the masses,

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.610
creating an empire in the process,

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.680
and yet there were other aspects of the man that didn't really fit comfortably

11
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:48.681
in to the American icon image from his antisemitism to his vehement opposition

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.610
to unions.

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.620
Henry Ford was a man who define you to description and in today's buying

14
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.710
graphics video,
we're going to get close and personal with Henry Ford.

15
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.790
Henry Ford was born on July the 30th 1863 in greenfield township,

16
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:14.020
Michigan.
It was the oldest of five children to William and Mary.

17
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:15.970
Fort William was an Irish immigrant.

18
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.380
While Mary was a first generation American of Belgian heritage,
the Ford family,

19
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.730
they were middle class farmers.

20
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.720
Henry was particularly close with his mother who he absolutely adored.

21
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.230
The children,
worked hard to help their father performed the day's labor.

22
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.460
Penry pitched in enthusiastically though be never really enjoyed the work he

23
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:37.270
needs.
A comment says I never had any particular love for the farm.

24
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.420
It was the mother on the farm that I loved and re he disliked school much

25
00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:44.980
preparing to study on his own terms.

26
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.810
He had a huge amounts of curiosity and this was mixed with his creativity.

27
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.710
By the time he had reached his teens and rate was obsessed with gadgets,

28
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.220
he had a habit of taking apart watches and then putting them back together.

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.450
He did this over and over again and suddenly you could do it in a matter of

30
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.030
minutes.
His reputation as a watch repairman,

31
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.090
it begins to grow and soon he was maintaining the time pieces of everyone in his

32
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:07.810
neighborhood.

33
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.310
When he was 13 Henry saw a steam powered motor vehicle for the first time.

34
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.840
He was fascinated with it and he instantly recognized its potential to replace

35
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:20.740
the horse as the main means of transportation.
From that point on,

36
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.640
he was absolutely obsessed with automobiles.

37
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.323
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.790
<v 0>A short while after the encounter with the vehicle,
Henry's beloved mother,</v>

39
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.320
she died very suddenly.
Naturally Henry was heartbroken from that point on.

40
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.110
He wants it to get off the farm as it simply held.

41
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.210
Too many memories is opportunity.

42
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.510
It came three years later when he was offered his first job.

43
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.890
He moved to Detroit to become an apprentice machinist for James F flower and

44
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:53.840
brothers who made machine parts.

45
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.090
He laid to move to the Detroit dry dock company by night.

46
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.620
He worked at a watch repair company in order to pay his rent.

47
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.000
Any spare time that he had,

48
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.940
it spends on his mechanical experiments in 1882 at the age of 19 Henry Reed

49
00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:09.880
sounds of the family farm to help his father.
He's still hated farming,

50
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.100
but he loved tinkering with the farm machinery.

51
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.540
His father had purchased a Westinghouse portable steam engine and Henry made it

52
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.550
his mission to perfect the use of it.

53
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.350
They became so good on the machine that he managed to get a summer job at the

54
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.183
Westinghouse Electric Company in Detroit.

55
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.240
He demonstrated and repaired steam engines that we use to power heavy machinery.

56
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.020
When are you turning?

57
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.570
21 of Henry's father gifted him with a sizable parcel of land.

58
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.910
He now splits his time between working the lands,

59
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.260
demonstrating Westinghouse machines and studying part time for a bookkeeping.

60
00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:50.090
To play that in early 1888 he met a young woman by the name of Clara Jen Bryant

61
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.610
after a short courtship.

62
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.330
The couple were married on April the 11th five years later their first and only

63
00:03:56.331 --> 00:04:00.410
child Edsel was born for now.
I had a family to look after.

64
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.100
He made ends meet by cutting and selling the timber on his lambs.

65
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.640
Within a year he set up a saw mill which became moderately profitable.

66
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.300
He built Saint Mechanical Workshop on the farm and it's continued tinkering on

67
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.620
heavy machinery and we had been brought up in Christian households and now that

68
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:19.790
he was a family man,
he seemed to take religion much more seriously.
Every Sunday.

69
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:24.560
He made an eight mile round trips.
He attends the nearest Episcopalian church.

70
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.050
He came to believe in reincarnation,

71
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:31.220
which was not an episcopalian concept rather than finding another church.

72
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:34.940
However,
he simply added this to his own personal belief system.

73
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.310
He has and evangelizing spirits,

74
00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:40.580
enjoying sharing his beliefs with others and was his religious beliefs.

75
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:45.410
He wrote religion like anything else is a thing that should be kept working.

76
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.490
I see no use in spending a great deal of time learning about heaven and hell in

77
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:54.080
my opinion.
Man makes his own heaven and a hell and carries it around with him.

78
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.930
Both of them are states of minds.

79
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.130
In 1885 Ford was tasked with fixing an auto engine,
a large station rate,

80
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.220
single cylinder,
internal combustion,

81
00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:13.840
four stroke engine designs by German Nicolaus Auto.

82
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.940
I've to bullying is a pass and analyzing every components.

83
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:20.780
He put it back together and working for him and then proceeded to make his own

84
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.340
version of this machine.
By 1890 he was working on a petrol powered engine.

85
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.540
In September of 1891 Henry secured a position at the Edison and illuminating

86
00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:33.650
company in Detroit.
In Gara,
moved to the city to make a new life.

87
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.430
Within two years,
Ford was promoted to the position of chief engineer.

88
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.910
Along with this promotion came a substantial pay rise.

89
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.840
This is provided in the means to work on as petrol engine when he wasn't working

90
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.460
for Thomas Edison in 1896 that countless evenings tinkering in his home
workshop.

91
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.500
They finally paid off with the unveiling of his first self propelled vehicle.

92
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.630
He called it the Ford quadricycle.

93
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.250
He presented his prototype to address and company executives and Keating Thomas

94
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.083
Edison himself.

95
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.090
Addison was intrigued and in fact delighted with Forbes invention encouraged by

96
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:11.750
the praise of his boss for developed a mark to model with numerous improvements.

97
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.680
Volts newer ends,
better quadricycle caught the attention of a Detroit,

98
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.110
a lumber baron by the name of William H.
Murphy.

99
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.090
Nothing but his money behind the young inventors.

100
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.660
They're allowing Henry to resigned from Edison and start his own company.

101
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.630
He called it the Detroit automobile company.

102
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.220
Investors wanted to capitalize on Ford's petrol motor as quickly as possible.

103
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.000
They pressured him to rush production.
As a result,

104
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.940
the vehicles produced were of a lower quality higher price than photos.

105
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.420
Happy with having produced just 20 automobiles.
The company,

106
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.630
it was dissolved in January of 1901 Ford was more relieved than deterred with

107
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.960
the closure of the Detroit automobile company with the pressure to produce no

108
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:51.560
longer on him.

109
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.970
He put his efforts into designing and building a 26 horsepower automobile in

110
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.600
October of 1901 in order to get publicity for his invention.

111
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.860
He began entering racing competitions often soundly,

112
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.020
beating the local champion in a 10 mile race.
See one back.

113
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:07.490
That confidence of his investors,

114
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.170
they were prepared to back a second company and so the Ford Motor Company was

115
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.740
born with Henry as its chief engine.
Yeah.
However,

116
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:19.230
the same tensions developed as previously when the investors brought in a

117
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.970
consultant to check and Reese focused on technological improvements in half the

118
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:26.330
company,
the new man,
Henry Leland's when zones to create his own vehicle,

119
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:30.350
the Cadillac and the company was renamed the Cadillac Automobile Company.

120
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.803
<v 4>Okay.</v>

121
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.400
<v 0>Ford now teamed up with a format cycle racing champion named Tom Cooper.</v>

122
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.450
Together they produced an 80 plus horsepower vehicle that they dubbed the nine

123
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.190
nine nine this call was raced by top race and Barry Oldfield to eight resounding

124
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:54.191
victory in an October of 1902 race with this success under his belt fought,

125
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.270
enters into a third company.

126
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.430
He teams up with a call dealer from Detroit named Alexander Malcolmson to form

127
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.090
forward and Malkin some limited.

128
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.510
He knows that about making an affordable automobile for the working man for to

129
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.620
and Malcolmson.
They found a factory and they got to work.

130
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.290
They contracted the dodge brothers,
John and Horace,

131
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.580
who owns a local machine shop to produce all the parts that they need it within

132
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.490
a year.
Fort had his new an affordable vehicle.

133
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.330
The challenge now is to set it.
Initial sales were slow,

134
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:25.370
which led to a cash flow crisis.

135
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.990
You invest as well brought on board and the company was reincorporated as the

136
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.380
Ford Motor Company in June of 1903 Fords,

137
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.100
new economical automobile was put to the test on the ice covered surface of

138
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.370
lake.
Some clash between Michigan and Ontario.

139
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.030
It's achieved a new land speed record of 91.3 miles per hour.

140
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:46.220
That's 146.9 kilometers an hour.

141
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.220
Barney Oldfield been toured the country to demonstrate the calm.

142
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.150
This publicity brought the name Henry Ford to a wide audience.

143
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.910
Sales affords a new car.
They grew by 1905 the company.

144
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.290
It was absolutely thriving forest where the only car manufacturer who we're

145
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:05.850
catering to the middle classes because of for the automobile it was no longer

146
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:07.680
just the pay thing for the rich.

147
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.280
Now it was able to be seen as a viable means of transport for pretty much

148
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:14.880
everybody.
No.
Just before we get into Ford's most notable vehicle,
of course,

149
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:15.660
the model t,

150
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.200
let me tell you a bit about today's sponsor who make the sort of longer videos

151
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:22.690
possible and that sponsor is Blinkist look.
Now if you,

152
00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:25.260
if you're watching this channel,
you're probably curious about things.

153
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:29.130
I mean why else would you commit to to a 20 minute video about Henry Ford and

154
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:32.580
this is why Blinkist is such a great fit for this very channel.

155
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.570
Blinkist is an APP that takes the best insights and need to know info from

read or you can listen to 8 million people currently use this APP and they're

158
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.650
consuming content.
That's from history to self help.

159
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.910
The way I consume think is that my commute to work is about 15 minutes each way.

160
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.040
So it's perfect for a little hit of knowledge.

161
00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:00.120
Blinkist is about 15 minutes of audio or tax to read.

162
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.170
It's really a way to fast track myself to the most important knowledge from

163
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:08.400
important books.
One that I recently recapped with Stephen Covey's seven habits.

164
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.840
A book that I've read in the past,

165
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.920
ams love blinkers provided me an amazing reminder of all of the best stuff from

166
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.650
that book,
but it's not a central that I'd read it in the first place,

167
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.490
but this is also a biography channel.

168
00:10:18.491 --> 00:10:22.470
So how about I recommend one of the many books from Walter Isaacson on that

169
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:26.730
platform.
He's biography,
people like Einstein,
Franklin Da Vinci,
Steve Jobs,

170
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.910
the first hundred people to go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash and

171
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:33.330
biographic it's going to get unlimited access for one week to try it out.

172
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.300
She wants to get 25% off.
If you want the full membership,

173
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.250

174
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.780
Vinci.
Again,
that's completely free.

175
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.130
Just go to blinkus.com forward slash biographics let's get back to fort.

176
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.690
In October,
1908 Ford released of a famous model t.

177
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.100
This streamlines vehicle has a number of innovative features including having

178
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.620
the steering wheel on the left and entirely enclosed transmission engine four

179
00:11:05.621 --> 00:11:10.190
cylinder is cast in solid block and it's a pair of semi elliptic suspension

180
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:10.880
springs.

181
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.140
The model t was easier than anything else on the market to drive and it was

182
00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:16.610
inexpensive to repair.

183
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.560
Now with the model t Ford introduced the assembly line production process.

184
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.590
Now.
He wasn't the first to use assembly line production procedures,

185
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:29.000
but he did refine it to make it as efficient and as therefore as cost effective

186
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:32.720
as possible.
Rather than having a group of employees working on a single vehicle,

187
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.550
Ford set up a conveyor system where the calm moved from one station to another.

188
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.570
At each station,

189
00:11:38.571 --> 00:11:43.070
a highly skilled worker would focus on just one aspect of the construction.

190
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.640
That worker would then repeat the same job over and over again.

191
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.320
This process cut down the time to produce a model t from 12 to only six hours.

192
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.060
As a result of these improved practices was able to sell his model to you the

193
00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.090
unheard of price of $895 which is $23,010 in today's money,

194
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.800
this was less than half of what other manufacturers were selling their vehicles

195
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.700
for.
As the assembly line process was,
streamlines the price of the model t.

196
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.530
It came down even further.

197
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.680
By 1912 it was down to $575 on the strength of the massive popularity of the

198
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:18.240
model.
T Ford was able to day,

199
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.940
gave 48% share of the u s automobile market.

200
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.150
By 1914 in 1913 though a multistory factory was built in Highland park.

201
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.180
The assembly of the model t would begin on the fourth floor with the engine and

202
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.470
it would move down floor by floor until the body was added on the final and

203
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:40.180
ground floor for to set up a network of model t franchises all over the country.

204
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.730
Salesman sold and not only the affordable car,

205
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:47.320
but also the concept of vehicle travel and the opportunities that came with it.

206
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.310
With the model t,

207
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:52.660
the country would be opened up to the masses with all the wonders that is held

208
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.470
in store.

209
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.470
Ford was determined that his buyers would become loyal fort customers for life.

210
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.040
As a result,
he offered an unheard of guarantee.
When you bought a model t,

211
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.270
the Ford factory would stands behind you maintaining it at the most affordable

212
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:08.260
price possible.

213
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.030
Ford was a firm believer in welfare capitalism.

214
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.960
He wanted to maintain a happy workforce who were treated fairly.
As a result,

215
00:13:20.961 --> 00:13:24.170
he introduced innovative programs and benefits for his staff.

216
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.350
In 1914 he introduced the living wage where each worker received a minimum of $5

217
00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:30.651
per day.

218
00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:35.651
This would be the equivalent of about $120 in 2019 this is always double the pay

219
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:38.150
that most other companies were offering at the time.

220
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.240
One reason that Ford brought in the living wage was that prior to its

221
00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:45.140
introduction,
his factories had a very high employee turnover rate.

222
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.550
Some departments numbering a hundred men tons over 30 employees a year.

223
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.420
This was largely due to the monotony of the production line process.
Now,

224
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:56.840
the increased pay offset the boredom of the job.

225
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.830
The living wage allowed for us to attract the best mechanics in Detroit of the

226
00:14:00.831 --> 00:14:01.221
companies.

227
00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:05.820
They were forced to raise their wages or simply lose their workers for Aussie.

228
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.660
Did other things to ensure a happy workforce is factories.

229
00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:12.980
That cafeteria is water fountains,
healthcare ins company sponsored sports teams.

230
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.940
The benefits that Ford brought to his workforce.

231
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.840
Though they came with a few strings.

232
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.710
He expected his workers live clean lives in accordance with Christian and moral

233
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:22.490
principles.

234
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.390
He established a social departments which kept a close eye on the private lives

235
00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:27.260
of his employees.

236
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.670
Anyone who was seen to be overdrinking gambling or not providing adequately for

237
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:35.120
that family would be subjected to an intervention.
Meanwhile,

238
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:39.710
businesswise cells of the model t we're going from strength to strength and

239
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:44.711
dropping the price of the basic touring car to $360 saw sales reaching 472,000

240
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.250
in 1916 every single one of those cars was black as was the color that dried the

241
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.720
fastest on the assembly line.

242
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.430
This led forward to to the rather famous line that any customer can have a car

243
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:02.450
painted any color he wants,
so long as it is black

244
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.460
voted was completely opposed to us participation in world war one he was a

245
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:17.540
pacifist.
He was offended by other businessmen who profited from war trade.

246
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.390
In 1915 he teams up with Hungarian born Jewish pacifist or seek a Schwimmer and

247
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.690
funded a piece ship to travel to Europe and advocate for an end of the fighting

248
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.670
117 leading pacifists.

249
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:32.480
It's boarded the ship headed along with Ford and Schwimmer to the Netherlands

250
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:33.620
and then on to Sweden.

251
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.250
The voyage did not have official US government blessing and it soon became the

252
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:41.990
subject of intense ridiculed for decided to distance himself from the enterprise

253
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.070
and he left the ship and made his own way back to the United States.

254
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.360
Around this time,
VOD began.
Z make public is antisemitic beliefs.

255
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.410
He claims that the war had been started by German Jewish bankers and that he was

256
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:57.440
collecting information that would make that fact clear.

257
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.950
Despite its founders pacifist and antisemitic sentiments,

258
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:05.090
the Ford Motor company was pressed into producing engines for fighter planes and

259
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.530
anti submarine boats.

260
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:11.531
Once the u s entered the war in 1917 and 1918 at the urging of President Woodrow

261
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.010
Wilson Ford ran for the Senate seat and Michigan Ford was an advocate for

262
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:19.730
Wilson's League of nations and the president had felt that if Ford won Michigan,

263
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.780
it could tip the scale in his favor and congress.
He told Ford,

264
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.640
you are the only man in Michigan who can be elected and help bring about the

265
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:31.760
peace you so desire fought.
He ran,

266
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.000
but he lost by about 4,500 votes.
Still,

267
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.450
he did remain a staunch advocate of the League of nations.

268
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.660
A month after the end of the war in December of 19 1940 handed the reigns of the

269
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.510
Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel,
who is now 26 years old.
However,

270
00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.510
the father retains the right to veto any decision.

271
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.920
In 1918 Ford had purchased a small newspaper called the Dearborn independence.

272
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.780
Every Ford factory issued this paper to its employees throughout the 1920s Ford

273
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:09.890
use this paper as the vehicle for disseminating his antisemitic views.

274
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.180
He believed that an international Jewish conspiracy was walking to take control

275
00:17:14.181 --> 00:17:14.900
of the world.

276
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.900
Between 1920 and 1922 we published a multivolume work titled The International

277
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.340
Jew.
Historians now believe that these books were an influence on ad off Hitler's

278
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:29.450
worldview during the warriors for worked with his son to take the Ford Motor

279
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.440
Company to the rest of the world.

280
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.460
A massive complex was built at River Rouge in Dearborn,
Michigan.

281
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.670
This was the world's largest industrial complex at the time.

282
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.260
By 1929 he had thriving dealerships on all six continents.

283
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.010
Ford wanted his business to become a vertically integrated company.

284
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.850
This means that every aspect of supply for the company would be owned by the

285
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:55.110
company.
This meant that the company wouldn't have to rely upon any suppliers,

286
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.880
especially foreign suppliers.

287
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:02.060
On May the 31st of 1929 Ford signed a nine year technical assistance agreement

288
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:06.150
with the Soviet government forces would help the Soviets set up an automobile

289
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:10.290
blinds in the Soviets would purchase $30 million worth of knocked down for

290
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.460
trucks and cars.

291
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.660
Ford sent his best servicemen to the Soviet factory to train the Russians

292
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.580
by the mid 1920s the model t sales,
they would dwindling competitors.

293
00:18:25.581 --> 00:18:27.290
We're producing competing models,

294
00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:29.870
some of them with more powerful motors and better features.

295
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.650
It was time for a new model to roll off the production lines and model.

296
00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:38.570
A Ford was released in 1927 the car was available in a range of styles including

297
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.140
sports could pay truck and it's commercial.
I'm like the model t.

298
00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:43.730
It was available in four colors.

299
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.560
The model a was another hit for Ford with sales to 1931 topping 4 million by

300
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:53.561
1931 a third of all automobiles throughout the world were made by the Ford Motor

301
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.620
Company.
In the late 1920 Ford began building airplanes.

302
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.780
The most popular was the Ford for 80 try,
Mota,

303
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.560
commonly known as the tin goose fought for.

304
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:08.270
This was honored by the Smithsonian Institution for changing aviation history.

305
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.660
Henry Ford hated labor unions.

306
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.950
He was of the opinion that they served only the self interest of labor bosses

307
00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:22.750
who were detrimental to workers.

308
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.370
He felt that he was perfectly able to look after the interests of his works and

309
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.200
saw no need for bunions on his sites in order to scare off union activity.

310
00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:34.210
40 employed,
uh,
former navy boxer.

311
00:19:34.211 --> 00:19:38.530
Harry Bennet's had his service department then it was not averse to using

312
00:19:38.531 --> 00:19:40.600
violence to squash union activity.

313
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.340
On one occasion he had men be AARP United autoworkers representatives as the

314
00:19:45.341 --> 00:19:47.710
police simply looked on this incidence,

315
00:19:47.711 --> 00:19:51.460
which became known as the battle of the overpass was widely reported.

316
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.880
It's hard Ford's reputation and it increased support for the union.

317
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.870
Edsel Ford recognized that that was a need for a collective bargaining

318
00:19:58.871 --> 00:20:00.790
agreements with unions.
However,

319
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:05.200
his father vetoed the idea of him even talking to the unions.

320
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.780
In April,
1941 there was a sit down strike,

321
00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:11.920
which closed down the river rouge plant fort prepared to shut down his entire

322
00:20:11.921 --> 00:20:13.750
business rather than deal with the union.

323
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.860
It was only the intervention of his long suffering wife Plora that brought him

324
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.400
to his senses with the recalcitrants of the old man.
Out of the way,

325
00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:25.240
it's still managed to sign an agreement with the United Auto Workers Union.

326
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.310
In June of 1941

327
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.920
[inaudible] obsession with blaming the Jews for the worlds ills intensified over

328
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:40.830
the years.
His newspaper,
the Dearborn Independence,

329
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.400
published 91 consecutive articles to writing Jews.

330
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.550
Jewish leaders responded by calling for of Fords cars.

331
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.450
In 1927 he was sued for Lidl,
the case.
It was settled out of court.

332
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.710
Shortly thereafter for degreed to shut down production of his newspaper.

333
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.130
In the early 1920s Ford had been given a copy of a book gold,

334
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.440
the Protocol of the Elders of Zion,

335
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:06.400
which had been produced by the Russian sauce secret service in the early 19

336
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:10.900
hundreds it painted a damning picture if the supposed worldwide Jewish

337
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:14.260
conspiracy fought.
He believed every word of it.
However,

338
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:18.760
within a few years it was exposed as a fake.
Went forward.
Learned of this.

339
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:22.120
He was horrified and z often an apology to the Jewish community,

340
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:26.410
assuring them of his future friendship and goodwill.
Despite these words,

341
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:30.490
Ford continued to denounce Jews throughout the 1930s he did business with Nazi

342
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:34.900
Germany up to and including the warriors at the same time he produced be 24

343
00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:36.430
bombers for the u s military.

344
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:41.730
Ford is the only American mentioned favorably and mine comf speaking in 1931 two

345
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:46.120
eight Detroit News reporter Hitless ads that he regarded forward as his

346
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.140
inspiration.

347
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.550
This explained his reason for keeping Ford's life size portrait next to his
desk.

348
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.020
Headline reveal at Fort stating that I shall do my best to put his theories into

349
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:59.830
practice in Germany and modeling the Volkswagen on the model t.

350
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.593
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

351
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.370
<v 0>In May,
1943 49 year old Edsel Ford died of stomach cancer.</v>

352
00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.450
Henry now aged 80 was forced to run the company one small.
Yes.

353
00:22:14.451 --> 00:22:15.590
He was not a well man.

354
00:22:15.591 --> 00:22:18.680
Having already suffered from a series of strokes and heart attacks.

355
00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.840
He was at the helm for two years,

356
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.950
at which point he handed the reins over to his grandson,
Henry Ford.
The second,

357
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.500
Henry Ford's retirement was short lived.

358
00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.470
He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on April the seventh of 1947 it is Dearborn,

359
00:22:31.471 --> 00:22:32.270
a state,

360
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:36.860
100,000 people showed up at his funeral to honor the man who brought private
