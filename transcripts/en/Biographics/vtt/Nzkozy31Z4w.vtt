1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>The seventh is one of the most famous women who has ever lived.</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Her story has inspired poets,</v>

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:06.751
<v Speaker 1>dramatists,</v>

4
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>and artists for more than 2000 years through cunning and guile.</v>

5
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>She survived to rule Egypt as all of us siblings perished by the wayside.</v>

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
<v Speaker 1>I think beauty and charm led to one of the most celebrated romances in history</v>

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>and the ancient world's ultimate tragedy.</v>

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>we get up close and personal with the original Queen of denial,</v>

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra,</v>

11
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.470
<v Speaker 1>why the time of the birth of Cleopatra,</v>

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>the seventh and 69 bce.</v>

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Egypt had a 3000 year old history of power and decline.</v>

14
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>The country was ruled by a dynasty of Pharaoh's each with a named ptolemy who</v>

15
00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>had arrived from Macedonia in 323 bce.</v>

16
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.091
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

17
00:00:56.091 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>however they face the danger of invasion from the menacing Roman empire.</v>

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>First ptolemies had ruled benevolently,</v>

19
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>but their descendants,</v>

20
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>including Cleopatra's father proved to be weak,</v>

21
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>even foolish leaders as a results Cleopatra's early years were unsettled.</v>

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>She knew that her family was at war with the people that it rules and with</v>

23
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

24
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>the people suffered under the cruelty of Ptolemy.</v>

25
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>The Twelfth Cleopatra's father,</v>

26
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.140
<v Speaker 1>and they resented his alliance with Rome when Cleopatra was just four years old,</v>

27
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>the citizens of Alexandria rioted and Chase Ptolemy out of Egypt.</v>

28
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>He fled to Romance Cleopatra's oldest sister Berenice became queen.</v>

29
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

30
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>ptolemy returns to Egypt with the help of Roman General Pompei.</v>

31
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>He snatched back power from baroness and ruled again as Pharaoh.</v>

32
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>One of his first orders was for his oldest daughter to be executed.</v>

33
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra now had two surviving sisters and two younger brothers.</v>

34
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>All of ptolemies children hoped to eventually ruled,</v>

35
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>which made them all rivals shortly after the execution of baroness,</v>

36
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the oldest daughter of Ptolemy,</v>

37
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra.</v>

38
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Trifacta died in mysterious circumstances.</v>

39
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Many historians believe that she was poisoned by one of her siblings.</v>

40
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.911
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

41
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra had only one sister still alive,</v>

42
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the youngest Asano.</v>

43
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>She must've wondered how long she would survive.</v>

44
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.901
<v Speaker 1>Her.</v>

45
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Two younger brothers were named Ptolemy.</v>

46
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>According to the custom,</v>

47
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>they would both eventually become rulers of Egypt as Ptolemy,</v>

48
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the 13th and Ptolemy the 14th.</v>

49
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>By the time she was 14.</v>

50
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra was ptolemies oldest living daughter.</v>

51
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>When he died,</v>

52
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 1>she would become queen as the wife of her younger brother Ptolemy the 13th for</v>

53
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>the young girl.</v>

54
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>The prospect filter with both excitement and terror,</v>

55
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>vividly recalling the fate of her two sisters,</v>

56
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 1>she fed the enemies,</v>

57
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>might also tried to kill her,</v>

58
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.490
<v Speaker 1>but the young girl was clever.</v>

59
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>She had made friends with powerful courtiers who she felt would protect her.</v>

60
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra was groomed for rulership from her early teens.</v>

61
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>She learns new languages,</v>

62
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>including Egyptian,</v>

63
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>which surprisingly was not spoken at all in the royal court.</v>

64
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 1>All her family members,</v>

65
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>they simply spoke Greek.</v>

66
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>She also used religion to support our claim to the throne,</v>

67
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>claiming to be the daughter of the sun gods,</v>

68
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>ancient royal title.</v>

69
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>When their father died,</v>

70
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra and her husband slash brother began their rule.</v>

71
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It was 51 BC and she was nearly 18 years of age,</v>

72
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>10 years older than the new king.</v>

73
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>This allowed her to assume full responsibility for ruling the country.</v>

74
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It was a particularly complex time.</v>

75
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>In addition to domestic problems which included a discontented peasantry brought</v>

76
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>to its knees by famine.</v>

77
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention the hostility of other members of our own family.</v>

78
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>There were also problematic foreign relations.</v>

79
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>The most pressing issue was the unrelenting demands for taxes coming from Rome.</v>

80
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Despite the requirements of having a husband Ptolemy,</v>

81
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the 13th appointed to rule with her.</v>

82
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>She didn't take kindly to having him tagging along.</v>

83
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Her solution was to oust him from his position and rule alone for the next 18</v>

84
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.114
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

85
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.350
<v Speaker 1>One thing that we knew for sure was that she could not beat the Romans that</v>

86
00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>their military game at this point,</v>

87
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>so therefore she had to take off where I left off and keep appeasing the Roman</v>

88
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.724
<v Speaker 1>overlords.</v>

89
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>She attempted damage control by working with the Roman oppressors in the hope</v>

90
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that they would give up on Egypt entirely like a father.</v>

91
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>She chose survival,</v>

92
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>but she had one advantage over him.</v>

93
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.273
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra,</v>

94
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>she was clever and she knew how to play the cards that she was dealt to best</v>

95
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

96
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>She would continue to do so throughout her reign.</v>

97
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Up until the very end,</v>

98
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't allowed to fold her hands if she could see any way to play to the</v>

99
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>best of her ability.</v>

100
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>And she would absolutely bluff if necessary.</v>

101
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>She would eliminate every other folk in the game and keep a few aces up our</v>

102
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:34.651
<v Speaker 1>sleeve by willing key Alexandrians Romans and the priests over to our site.</v>

103
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>She was a brilliant strategist even at the young age when she became regions.</v>

104
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.191
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

105
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>given that she was ruling Egypt and given the tempestuous history of our family,</v>

106
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>nothing was going to come easy to a new ruler,</v>

107
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>especially a female one.</v>

108
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Her little brother had his supporters or should I say his controllers,</v>

109
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and they wanted to have the power in their hands,</v>

110
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>not in the hands of Cleopatra.</v>

111
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>When I say they,</v>

112
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking mainly of a man named goodness Pompei,</v>

113
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>who at the time was the supreme control river.</v>

114
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Him The man who gave her father the title of King and the person who was given</v>

115
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>the rights to possess Cypress.</v>

116
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>It is highly unlikely that Pompei saw Cleopatra as too smart to simply be</v>

117
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>mollified as her father had been.</v>

118
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>She would be hard to control and a constant threat to Roman dominance over</v>

119
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

120
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>How there's a brother needed some assistance and this was given to him in the</v>

121
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>form of room and support.</v>

122
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Pompei would show up occasionally to formally recognize the little brother over</v>

123
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>the big sister as the ruler of Egypt with pompey is backing Ptolemy,</v>

124
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>the 13th when to war with his big sister driving half from power in 49 ce,</v>

125
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra discovered that her husband was plotting with palm pay to send</v>

126
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>soldiers to kidnap and possibly kill her.</v>

127
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>She knew that she must leave Egypt's and so she said,</v>

128
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:47.944
<v Speaker 1>sail for Syria.</v>

129
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Eventually hope to recruit an army to help our wind back the throne from her.</v>

130
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

131
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen year old husband slash brother Cleopatra choose to flee to Syria because</v>

132
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>the ptolemies had once ruled that the king of Syria was also an enemy of Rome.</v>

133
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:00.763
<v Speaker 1>Like Cleopatra.</v>

134
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He fears that his own country would be taken over by the mighty Roman Empire.</v>

135
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>She took her only surviving sister I'll send into exile without.</v>

136
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>This was partly to protect the younger girl from her brother's raft,</v>

137
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>but also to stop her from seizing the throne herself.</v>

138
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.770
<v Speaker 1>While these dramas were playing out in the ptolemaic dynasty up north,</v>

139
00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:28.750
<v Speaker 1>a bloody civil war was taking place General Julius Caesar Battles and defeated</v>

140
00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 1>the forces of general pompey.</v>

141
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Pompey arrived in Glucagon in Egypt's hoping to get money,</v>

142
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.180
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

143
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.720
<v Speaker 1>men and ships because he was running low on what he needed to defeat Caesar.</v>

144
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Up until that time,</v>

145
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.000
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians had been on the receiving ends of much of the support from room</v>

146
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.080
<v Speaker 1>due to the relationship established between Cleopatra's father and Pompei.</v>

147
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Before Caesar rose up to challenge the Redmond general and now the pump.</v>

148
00:06:50.881 --> 00:06:53.320
<v Speaker 1>They had just lost badly to seize a fossil.</v>

149
00:06:53.321 --> 00:06:55.600
<v Speaker 1>This he needed Egypt's help.</v>

150
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile sees it was in pursuits and also looking for aid for his military</v>

151
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:00.220
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>

152
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>He arrived in Alexandria with a rather modest military force.</v>

153
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.500
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

154
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it seems to the young Egyptian king and his advisors that Cesar was going to be</v>

155
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:10.360
<v Speaker 1>the eventual victor in Rome.</v>

156
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.470
<v Speaker 1>If the king continue to support Pompei to continue his war against Caesar on</v>

157
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian soil,</v>

158
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.140
<v Speaker 1>the battles could devastate Egypt's and if pompei eventually last season would</v>

159
00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.630
<v Speaker 1>be enraged against the Egyptian readership.</v>

160
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Caught between a rock and a hard place.</v>

161
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>As soon as Pompei landed with troops that palace,</v>

162
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Iom,</v>

163
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.121
<v Speaker 1>Ptolemy,</v>

164
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 1>the 13th,</v>

165
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.381
<v Speaker 1>had Pompei,</v>

166
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.620
<v Speaker 1>ambushed and killed event delivered pompous had to Desisa.</v>

167
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.131
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

168
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:34.090
<v Speaker 1>the king miscalculated.</v>

169
00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 1>How happy sees would be to see as enemies had presented to him by the Egyptian</v>

170
00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>

171
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Pompei may have been his rival,</v>

172
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 1>but it was up to Caesar to decide Pompez face not have the upstart Egyptian</v>

173
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 1>king.</v>

174
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>You said that right.</v>

175
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Even though he was horrified by the brutal murder of Pompei,</v>

176
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Caesar wanted to keep the peace he had come to Egypt to collect a huge sum of</v>

177
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:57.580
<v Speaker 1>money that you've claimed Cleopatra's father had owed him.</v>

178
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.440
<v Speaker 1>He ordered both Ptolemy and Cleopatra to meet with him to discuss the P</v>

179
00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:02.050
<v Speaker 1>streeting.</v>

180
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.010
<v Speaker 1>The now 21 year old queen saw her opportunity to act.</v>

181
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>She slipped past ptolemies general,</v>

182
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>the killers.</v>

183
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>It was blocking Glucagon and sales along the coastline to Alexandria bike,</v>

184
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.700
<v Speaker 1>way of denial.</v>

185
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Then she went to see Caesar at the palace.</v>

186
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra had developed into a very mature and savvy young women.</v>

187
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Legend has it that she secret at a self in a rolled up bedroll in order to get</v>

188
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 1>into the palace that this has largely been debunked,</v>

189
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 1>but she did not need to go through quite so covert length to get an audience</v>

190
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 1>with Cesar in Alexandria.</v>

191
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Speaker 1>She had been communicating with him from her posts over the border shortly</v>

192
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:38.410
<v Speaker 1>before sneaking past to kill us and heading toward Alexandria.</v>

193
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.370
<v Speaker 1>She sent word to Caesar that she was coming or he had sent word to her,</v>

194
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 1>telling her to come.</v>

195
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

196
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.370
<v Speaker 1>it's likely it was no surprise that Cleopatra was arriving in the harbor that</v>

197
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

198
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Cleopatra,</v>

199
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:53.680
<v Speaker 1>dawn's her most impressive outfits and took great effort to look beautiful for</v>

200
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>her audience with season whatever she did,</v>

201
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>worked a treat and sees the ordered that she'd be restored to the throne.</v>

202
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.151
<v Speaker 1>Naturally.</v>

203
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>When Ptolemy arrived to find Cleopatra and the palace re-installed as CCO</v>

204
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 1>regions,</v>

205
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>he was not at all pleased.</v>

206
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

207
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>he threw a royal fit as impressed as Caesar was with the Queen.</v>

208
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.320
<v Speaker 1>He wisely took into consideration the support that her brother,</v>

209
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Hans,</v>

210
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>among many of the upper crust of Alexandria.</v>

211
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.451
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

212
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>he decided to handle the situation astutely,</v>

213
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>he wisely reds to brother and sister,</v>

214
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>the will of the father,</v>

215
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>which stated that he wanted them to rule together,</v>

216
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 1>but the young king,</v>

217
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.820
<v Speaker 1>he was not appeased.</v>

218
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.480
<v Speaker 1>He ran out of the palace and threw down his crown in a terrible rage and a new</v>

219
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>

220
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Allow Ptolemy to leave the city and join his sister,</v>

221
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.611
<v Speaker 1>Austin.</v>

222
00:09:36.611 --> 00:09:36.781
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

223
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>In Sicily days after the Alexandrian war ended,</v>

224
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the advocated king's body was found lying in the harbor</v>

225
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.050
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in years.</v>

226
00:09:50.051 --> 00:09:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra now felt safe,</v>

227
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:51.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

228
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:52.880
<v Speaker 1>enemy husbands,</v>

229
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:56.740
<v Speaker 1>along with his advisors were dead and Caesar had promised to protect her and her</v>

230
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.580
<v Speaker 1>new husband,</v>

231
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.970
<v Speaker 1>her surviving 11 year olds,</v>

232
00:09:58.971 --> 00:09:59.771
<v Speaker 1>brother Ptolemy,</v>

233
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 1>the 14th with Caesar.</v>

234
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.930
<v Speaker 1>She sailed down the Nile in order to be test subjects and impress them with our</v>

235
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:05.530
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

236
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Rumor spread that she was pregnant with seizes child,</v>

237
00:10:07.871 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 1>which came to be known as ces,</v>

238
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Arion.</v>

239
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>When he's at return to Rome,</v>

240
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.940
<v Speaker 1>he left at 15,000 of his finest soldiers to guard the queen after taking control</v>

241
00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 1>of Egypt.</v>

242
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Return to Rome where he was hailed as a hero before long.</v>

243
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra had come north to join him.</v>

244
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.480
<v Speaker 1>She claimed that the trip was to negotiate a peace treaty between Egypt and</v>

245
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Rome,</v>

246
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but she also wanted to make sure of Caesar's protection.</v>

247
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.590
<v Speaker 1>She did not once want a younger brother or his advises to try to seize power in</v>

248
00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Egypt while she was away.</v>

249
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Many Romans chief,</v>

250
00:10:35.621 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between Cleopatra and Caesar.</v>

251
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 1>It was widely feared that Caesar would names dot Darian as his app and so the</v>

252
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra would then have a hold on the Roman empire through his son sees a</v>

253
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.050
<v Speaker 1>celebrated his victories by parading his captives through the streets of Rome.</v>

254
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra sister also know who led the Egyptian army against Caesar,</v>

255
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>was dragged through the streets,</v>

256
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:57.550
<v Speaker 1>back headed in chains.</v>

257
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a disgrace for women to appear in public this way.</v>

258
00:11:00.101 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>At the time it was the custom for Egyptian women to wear a long cloak and avail</v>

259
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.360
<v Speaker 1>outside of their homes.</v>

260
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

261
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Austin,</v>

262
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky,</v>

263
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.560
<v Speaker 1>unlike other prisoners,</v>

264
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.550
<v Speaker 1>she was not killed.</v>

265
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Caesar felt that the Romans might right if they saw a princess publicly executed</v>

266
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.471
<v Speaker 1>to give.</v>

267
00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the victory at the battle of soulless sees that builds a new</v>

268
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:18.461
<v Speaker 1>template,</v>

269
00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Rome.</v>

270
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.720
<v Speaker 1>He also paid for a beautiful statue of Cleopatra to be put on display in the</v>

271
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:23.350
<v Speaker 1>temple.</v>

272
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.650
<v Speaker 1>It showed her as a mother holding and in her arms</v>

273
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.390
<v Speaker 2>as a</v>

274
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>reward for his victories.</v>

275
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 1>The Senate made sees a dictator for life,</v>

276
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but some Romans feared that Caesar was becoming too powerful and that he wanted</v>

277
00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:41.324
<v Speaker 1>to be king.</v>

278
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Speaker 1>About 60 conspirators decided that Caesar had to be killed.</v>

279
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.620
<v Speaker 1>The plants which was led by brutus and Cassius was carried through immediately</v>

280
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>following a Senate meeting in 44 BC,</v>

281
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the shocking news of Caesar's murder spread through the Roman empire like</v>

282
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.863
<v Speaker 1>wildfire.</v>

283
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra who was in Rome at the time of the assassination lost no time in</v>

284
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 1>hurrying back to Egypt now that season protect who was dead.</v>

285
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>A kingdom was once more in danger.</v>

286
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Many hostile nations saw Egypt as a rich prize and hope to conquer it.</v>

287
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra kept us sciences area enclosed by her side because she feared that he</v>

288
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>might be murdered by his enemies on her return to Egypt.</v>

289
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra found this sister.</v>

290
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask to know who had been released from Raymond Captivity,</v>

291
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>was plotting with an anti seize a faction in the hype of seizing power.</v>

292
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Many of the nobles in the Egyptian court supported arsenault and joined her in</v>

293
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 1>her conspiracy against Cleopatra.</v>

294
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>At this time that nation was suffering a crisis due to the failure of the Nile</v>

295
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 1>floods.</v>

296
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 1>There was not enough water in the river to spread rich mode over the fields in</v>

297
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>order to irrigate them.</v>

298
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

299
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 1>farmers' crops and animals died,</v>

300
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:44.710
<v Speaker 1>and as many families suffered from famine and disease,</v>

301
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 1>many nobles and officials were angry that Cleopatra did not take moves to help</v>

302
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>the victims of the famine.</v>

303
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 1>The tenuous situation for Cleopatra Mandatory needed a new Rehmann protector who</v>

304
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:55.594
<v Speaker 1>she could lean on,</v>

305
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and that came in the form of Marc Antony.</v>

306
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>CAESARS murder led to three terrible years of warfare in Rome as different</v>

307
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 1>groups of Roman senators and members of leading Roman families struggled to take</v>

308
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

309
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.000
<v Speaker 1>The rival armies were led by three powerful men and each hopes to take seizes</v>

310
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.490
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

311
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Ruler,</v>

312
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 1>their names were octavian who sees his nephew,</v>

313
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Mark Antony and Marcus.</v>

314
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Let us finally in 42 bce,</v>

00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:24.280
<v Speaker 1>the room and lands were divided among the three Manzanita control of the entire</v>

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.360

<v Speaker 1>and control of Egypt,</v>

319
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:34.381
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania.</v>

320
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:36.140
<v Speaker 1>It's still needed Cleopatra's support,</v>

321
00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:38.150
<v Speaker 1>and he feared that she might support his enemies.</v>

322
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.020
<v Speaker 1>He needed goals from Egypt in order to pay his armies in order to keep control</v>

323
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.850
<v Speaker 1>of his share of the empire.</v>

324
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.320
<v Speaker 1>He also needed Egypt screen in order to feed his men Anthony rates of Cleopatra</v>

325

<v Speaker 1>runs when she did not reply,</v>

326
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.260
<v Speaker 1>he summoned to meet him.</v>

327
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra was in no hurry to response Anthony.</v>

328
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.801
<v Speaker 1>Instead.</v>

329
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.120
<v Speaker 1>She deliberately took her time.</v>

330
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 1>She knew that anthony needed Egypt skulls and in return she planned to ask for</v>

331
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:01.354
<v Speaker 1>his protection.</v>

332
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.560
<v Speaker 1>She also wanted his help to kill enemies,</v>

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.870
<v Speaker 1>The queen herself was dressed as the Greek goddess of Love Aphrodite.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She laid on my couch beneath the canopy of gold cloth.</v>

346

<v Speaker 1>but the queen refused insisting that he joined her on her royal barge.</v>

348
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.800
<v Speaker 1>She did a great cat without preparations.</v>

349
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.900
<v Speaker 1>She wants it to Anthony to be delighted,</v>

350

<v Speaker 1>astonished,</v>

351
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly impressed.</v>

352
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.240
<v Speaker 1>She arranged for her to be decorated with thousands of tiny oil lamps and</v>

353

<v Speaker 1>glittering flickering patterns of lights,</v>

354

<v Speaker 1>She was reminding Antony that according to legend task,</v>

360
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.440
<v Speaker 1>this was the place where aphrodite and diagnosis met and fell in love.</v>

361
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra's seduction worked how dramatic visit to Tarsus had one.</v>

362
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Anthony support in her struggled to remain the ruler of Egypt as he forgot his</v>

363
00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:26.660

365
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra on the left hand side.</v>

366
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.041
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

367
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>her two remaining siblings,</v>

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.131
<v Speaker 1>14th,</v>

370
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:37.964
<v Speaker 1>were put to death.</v>

371
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

372
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra became pregnant.</v>

373
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Anthony did not remain in Europe to see the birth of his twins,</v>

374
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 1>a boy and a girl in 40 BC had to return to Rome because his wife fava was</v>

376
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra continued to really Jeb.</v>

377
00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It's because Anthony did not return for another four years when he sailed back</v>

378
00:15:56.661 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>in 36 BC after a disastrous defeat and Patho,</v>

379
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra welcomes him.</v>

380
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>She needed a strong ally to help keep Egypt independence.</v>

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Anthony plans to set up an empire in North Africa and the Middle East to</v>

382
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>challenges rivals in Rome.</v>

383
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra supported his plans because they would increase her own power in 35</v>

384
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They will also angry this anthony had divorced his Roman wife and outraged</v>

400
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Octavian personally declared war against Cleopatra and all of Egypt.</v>

401
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Even though Anthony had tried to avoid conflict with Rome,</v>

402
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.940
<v Speaker 1>it had now become impossible to avoid.</v>

403
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.380
<v Speaker 1>This was especially so after the Roman Senate.</v>

404
00:17:01.381 --> 00:17:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It's found out about his will in which he declared his intention to be buried in</v>

<v Speaker 1>September of 31 bce constituted a first fundamental step toward their defeat.</v>

409
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.021

410
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:23.660
<v Speaker 1>they were considered foreigners and enemies of Rome.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anthony succeeded in taking police iom and it's getting close to the gates of</v>
