<v Speaker 1>Been.</v>

2
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was the stereotypical country bumpkin hailing from rural New Zealand.</v>

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:04.591
<v Speaker 1>The shy,</v>

4
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>gangly beekeeper steps out of the shadows to take on one of the greatest</v>

5
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>physical challenges of them all.</v>

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Climbing the world's highest mountain through guts,</v>

<v Speaker 1>script,</v>

8
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>and determination.</v>

9
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.113
<v Speaker 1>He managed to,</v>

10
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>as he famously says,</v>

11
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>knock the bast it off.</v>

12
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>From there,</v>

13
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>he used his newfound fame as a platform to improve the lives of the Nepalese</v>

14
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>people who had developed an affinity for leaving behind the legacy of it endures</v>

15
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>beyond the record books.</v>

16
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>In today's buying graphics,</v>

17
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>we look at the life and the accomplishments of the first demands.</v>

18
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Who ever climbed Mount Everest,</v>

19
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Sir Edmund Hillary.</v>

20
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.861
<v Speaker 1>It means first of all,</v>

21
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>we're going to read was born on July the 20th 1919 in Aucklands and New</v>

22
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Zealand's shortly after the birth of his father,</v>

23
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Percival or Augustus was allocated a land grants in recognition of his service</v>

24
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>during the first world war as a results,</v>

25
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.121
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

26
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>which included three year olds in June,</v>

27
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>moved itself to the finding sediments of two cow or younger.</v>

28
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Brother.</v>

29
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Rex soon came along June.</v>

30
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Later described the three boys as follows,</v>

31
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>as had the brains,</v>

32
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.010
<v Speaker 1>racks have the looks,</v>

33
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>and I was the girl according to ads own recollections.</v>

34
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>It was his mother who held the family together.</v>

35
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>She managed the money that's made sure that the kids were okay.</v>

36
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>This was no easy task.</v>

37
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Hillary children has an adventurous streak that saw them pushing everything to</v>

38
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the limits.</v>

39
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>One seven racks swap to bicycles with edge riding on the one that was too small</v>

40
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

41
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.581
<v Speaker 1>Rex,</v>

42
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

43
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 1>founded hard to control the larger bike still living.</v>

44
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>The tag would be chasing him.</v>

45
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 1>He went as fast as he could turning your corner.</v>

46
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>He collided with a car bouncing off the bonus and then bouncing off the road.</v>

47
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>The driver was terrified that he had killed racks,</v>

48
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 1>but ed was merely terrified of the beating he knew his father would give him</v>

49
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>when he saw the state of the bike.</v>

50
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Although Percy was a pacifist,</v>

51
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 1>he was prone to fits of rage.</v>

52
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>These bursts of rage.</v>

53
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Think we usually directed at his oldest son,</v>

54
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 1>even though he feared the beatings,</v>

55
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the southern edge was determined to never give his father the satisfaction of</v>

56
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>admitting that he had done anything wrong despite the competitive bond with his</v>

57
00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

58
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.521
<v Speaker 1>Ed's other,</v>

59
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

60
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>they were filled with loneliness throughout this primary years.</v>

61
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make any friends while other kids were out playing.</v>

62
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>He fills his time with extra tuition,</v>

63
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>which allows him to enter high school two years ahead of his peers.</v>

64
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>This only made his social situation worst,</v>

65
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>though he was now shorter and the younger than all the other kids high school</v>

66
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>men's,</v>

67
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>that he had to take the train to the prestigious Auckland Grammar school and rub</v>

68
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>shoulders with the children of the wealthy.</v>

69
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 1>This intensified his lack of self confidence and social awkwardness.</v>

70
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Even further in his later years often recounts an incidents that occurred during</v>

71
00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:32.101
<v Speaker 1>his first week.</v>

72
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You could Auckland's grammar that had a deep impact on him.</v>

73
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>He turns up for his first gym class along with his classmates.</v>

74
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 1>The teacher surveyed his new students and then fixing his gaze on Ed said,</v>

75
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>what have they sent me?</v>

76
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He then went zones,</v>

77
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.881
<v Speaker 1>the catalog,</v>

78
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 1>a long list of what he saw was wrong with that.</v>

79
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

80
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.610
<v Speaker 1>he told the humiliated boy to go against the wall with the other misfits.</v>

81
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Ed Recalls that this incident is marked the beginning of a sense of inferiority</v>

82
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:55.834
<v Speaker 1>about his looks,</v>

83
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>which would remain with him for the rest of his life.</v>

84
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Ed founds the companionship that he lacks with other humans in books.</v>

85
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.880
<v Speaker 1>After waiting through the typical teenage and literary attractions of the days</v>

86
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>such as Edgar Rice Burroughs and h a Haggis,</v>

87
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>he discovered books on mounds and narrowing.</v>

88
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>They fascinated him and he devoured everything on the subject that he could get</v>

89
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>his hands on personally around the local newspaper in the town and had a</v>

90
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.550
<v Speaker 1>sideline business as a beekeeper in 1935 and in last year at Oakland Grammar,</v>

91
00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the family moved to the inner Oakland suburb of rem or era.</v>

92
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Beekeeping now became the family's main source of income.</v>

93
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>The changements that adds no longer had to spend hours on the train every single</v>

94
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:32.824
<v Speaker 1>day</v>

95
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>from college,</v>

96
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Edwin's homes of the University of Auckland where he studied mathematics and</v>

97
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:41.014
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

98
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>He also joins the university tramping club with his long stride and is abundance</v>

99
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:45.551
<v Speaker 1>stamina.</v>

100
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>He seemed became a star Bush Walker.</v>

101
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>He also took lessons in boxing and Jujitsu that head to head combat.</v>

102
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.880
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't his style in 1938 as who had been struggling academically drops out of</v>

103
00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>the university and joined his father in the beekeeping business.</v>

104
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>His Stamina,</v>

105
00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.951
<v Speaker 1>endurance,</v>

106
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and physical strength were ideally suited for the job.</v>

107
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>It was hot,</v>

108
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>physically demanding work,</v>

109
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>and in the summer he would carry out his duties wearing only shorts or a hat and</v>

110
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>a veil every day it would have to India up to 300 bee stings.</v>

111
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Not long after ed began working on the beef farm,</v>

112
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>his parents converted to a new age,</v>

113
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>religious movements called radiant living.</v>

114
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 1>The group had beliefs that we're not far removed from those of Christian</v>

115
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>scientists at and his brother,</v>

116
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:23.891
<v Speaker 1>rex,</v>

117
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>they soon became converts to when war broke out in 1939 it appears inevitable</v>

118
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that both Hillary boys would be drafted into the New Zealand armed services,</v>

119
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but proceed.</v>

120
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>The pacifist was determined to prevent this from happening.</v>

121
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>He managed to get himself off the hook by relying on a provision that allowed</v>

122
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>exemptions for reserved occupations including beekeeping.</v>

123
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.191
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

124
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:43.581
<v Speaker 1>that person,</v>

125
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>he did all of this without telling Ed who was not happy to hear about his</v>

126
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>father's meddling personally soon discovered there's only one exemption per</v>

127
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>family was allowed as exemption men,</v>

128
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>so the corrects would have to go to war.</v>

129
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>It just so happens though that racks,</v>

130
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.880
<v Speaker 1>unlike Ed,</v>

131
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 1>was a conscientious objector ad would have been happy to sign up or there's</v>

132
00:04:59.151 --> 00:04:59.984
<v Speaker 1>wrecks wasn't.</v>

133
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>He followed his conscious and spent the next four years in a detention camp for</v>

134
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>three years and fumes silently that his father had prevented him from fulfilling</v>

135
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>what he saw as his patriotic duty.</v>

136
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.241
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

137
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>in 1944 he joins the Royal New Zealand Air Force.</v>

138
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>It was during his training as a flight navigator in New Zealand,</v>

139
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>South Islands that had encountered towering mountains.</v>

140
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>He managed to get in a few solo climbs.</v>

141
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Then he came across the 2,884 meters,</v>

142
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>snu camps and mounts,</v>

143
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.423
<v Speaker 1>Tapper Werner crew.</v>

144
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>He became determined to make an a sense and arranged for a three day leave.</v>

145
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>He arranged do plan the mountain with a partner,</v>

146
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but the man pulled out at the last minute and decided to go at alone with a</v>

147
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>friend taking him part of the way on his motorbike.</v>

148
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>He then walked eight kilometers to a farm where he stayed overnight.</v>

149
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>The next day he walked another 24 kilometers.</v>

150
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Overnight it there's another farm and then set off the mountain.</v>

151
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>He reached the top without any trouble anti returned safely.</v>

152
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>The next day he walked another 32 kilometers before receiving a left and it was</v>

153
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 1>delighted with this first experience.</v>

154
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>He had knocked off his first mountain and it felt</v>

155
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.100
<v Speaker 1>returning to his war service had found himself a stations to the Pacific</v>

156
00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:05.670
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

157
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.181
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>

158
00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:09.810
<v Speaker 1>he would recall coming across this small Fijian boy who came up and begged for a</v>

159
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:13.560
<v Speaker 1>piece of bread experiences like this form the catalyst for his great</v>

160
00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:16.980
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian work that he would pursue later in life ads.</v>

161
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.800
<v Speaker 1>He never came there combat though he did contract malaria.</v>

162
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.940
<v Speaker 1>His war also nearly ended in disaster when a full petrol tank in his plane fell</v>

163
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:25.140
<v Speaker 1>and burst into flames.</v>

164
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.860
<v Speaker 1>The plane came down into the ocean before ads who was not wearing a shirt could</v>

165
00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>jump Claire of the Blazer and craft a wave,</v>

166
00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:33.180
<v Speaker 1>knocked him off his feet and he fell into the flames.</v>

167
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.640
<v Speaker 1>He then managed to roll off the plane and into the sea.</v>

168
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Ed suffered secondary bands and the pain was made worse by going having to swim</v>

169
00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 1>450 meters and then walk 800 meters under the blazing sun before he reached</v>

170
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:44.250
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

171
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.970
<v Speaker 1>he was taken to a hospital in Guadalcanal where he was shot full of morphine and</v>

172
00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>

173
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 1>He was told that he would be in bed for months before he could achieve a full</v>

174
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:53.064
<v Speaker 1>recovery.</v>

175
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.550
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

176
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.190
<v Speaker 1>within two weeks he was up and walking about.</v>

177
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.030
<v Speaker 1>He became so restless and so board that he begged his doctors to allow him to</v>

178
00:07:00.031 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 1>recover at home in Oakland.</v>

179
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.250
<v Speaker 1>They finally relented and he was discharged from the air force and sent home.</v>

180
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.270
<v Speaker 1>When I got home.</v>

181
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 1>He didn't intend to buy rounds but rather gets work,</v>

182
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but when he discovered that his father had taken on other workers and to no</v>

183
00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>opening for him on the beef farm,</v>

184
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.560
<v Speaker 1>he moved to the South Islands in search of new opportunities.</v>

185
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>He joins the New Zealand Alpine club and over the next couple of years he learns</v>

186
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.980
<v Speaker 1>their climate is craft as he took on many of the mountain there,</v>

187
00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 1>speaks of the South Island and its claims with others but always wanted to be</v>

188
00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>the first to the top.</v>

189
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.670
<v Speaker 1>In 1949 oldest sister June got married personally had enjoyed and especially</v>

190
00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>good honey season and he paid for ed to travel with his parents to Europe edge.</v>

191
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Took every opportunity to take on European peaks including the Aiga Molly</v>

192
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.920
<v Speaker 1>was in Europe.</v>

193
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I had received a letter from a former climbing partner by the name of George</v>

194
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Lowe informing him that plans were underway.</v>

195
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Of a New Zealand party.</v>

196
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.310
<v Speaker 1>If you undertake a track of the Himalayas,</v>

197
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.570
<v Speaker 1>they intended to explore the possibility of tackling the world's highest peak</v>

198
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.503
<v Speaker 1>Mount Everest,</v>

199
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.740
<v Speaker 1>something that had never been done successfully before low.</v>

200
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He wants you to know whether Hillary was interested.</v>

201
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The answer as well as you might imagine,</v>

202
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:10.890
<v Speaker 1>it was an unequivocal yes and mountaineering terms.</v>

203
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.290
<v Speaker 1>There was no greater challenge than a successful,</v>

204
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.610
<v Speaker 1>a sense of Mount Everest,</v>

205
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.360
<v Speaker 1>which Tau is 8,848 meters from the ground.</v>

206
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Many climbers had died trying to get their most famous famously the British</v>

207
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:21.850
<v Speaker 1>climber,</v>

208
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 1>George Mallory and 1924 but turning point in the history of attempts on Everest</v>

209
00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 1>occurred in 1950 when the Nepalese government agreed to allow parties to attempt</v>

210
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 1>the mountain from Nepal on the southern side.</v>

211
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Previous expeditions at attacks from Tibet on the northern side of the mountain,</v>

212
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the Nepalese government decided to let a different country every year half ago.</v>

213
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It just so happens that in addition to the New Zealand group,</v>

214
00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:44.550
<v Speaker 1>a party of British climbers,</v>

215
00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:46.710
<v Speaker 1>we're also planning and assault on Everest.</v>

216
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.910
<v Speaker 1>The British group sent a letter to the New Zealand,</v>

217
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:51.030
<v Speaker 1>does suggesting that they join up the invitation.</v>

218
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.510
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

219
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 1>it was only for two clients.</v>

220
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.300
<v Speaker 1>The question was now,</v>

221
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>well you go after some heated discussion.</v>

222
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It was decided that edge,</v>

223
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>the acknowledged superior Kleiner and I'll read a third would be the token New</v>

224
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Zealanders on the British expedition rather than a concerted effort to reach the</v>

225
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>summit.</v>

226
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>This expedition was more of an exploratory probe while climbing with shifts in</v>

227
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 1>the expedition leader and every came across a vast hidden valley that appeared</v>

228
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>to provide a previously unknown route to the top.</v>

229
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>The group split up and agreed to return the next year.</v>

230
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>The following year in 1952 however,</v>

231
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 1>was assigned to a Swiss expedition.</v>

232
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Attempts to climb Everest,</v>

233
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the British within New Zealand contingents that have to wait until 1953</v>

234
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.771
<v Speaker 1>burning.</v>

235
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>The 1953 assaults began in a small office in London.</v>

236
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It was led by Eric Shipton who believed that the journey should be made by a</v>

237
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>small team with basic supplies but shipped and has only just begun choosing his</v>

238
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>team when there was a sudden change of plan.</v>

239
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Previous attempts to climb Everest by small teams had failed and it was decided</v>

240
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>that this time they would use a big team with the latest equipment and plenty of</v>

241
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>suppliers and new leader.</v>

242
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.510
<v Speaker 1>John Harms was appointed in March of 1953 the expedition team began to arrive in</v>

243
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:03.354
<v Speaker 1>Katmandu.</v>

244
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>The team got ready to make their way east to the Himalayas and Mount Everest.</v>

245
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was one of 14 climbers and more than 30 Nepalese shoppers who made up</v>

246
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 1>the team.</v>

247
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Nearly 400 people set off from Katmandu on March the 10th more than 350 of them</v>

248
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>were locals who are hired to carry supplies to the site for the first camp for</v>

249
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.284
<v Speaker 1>17 days.</v>

250
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>They walked through the Nepalese countryside until they arrived base camp.</v>

251
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Then they stayed for three weeks planning for clients to come.</v>

252
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>They practiced with their climbing gear on local cliffs and tried to get used to</v>

253
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the thin air if the high mountains in early April base camp was moved from near</v>

254
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Tengboche monastery to a second main base.</v>

255
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>The lake camp hire up by a lake on a glacier.</v>

256
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>The first big challenge for the leaders came on April the 13th for men,</v>

257
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.991
<v Speaker 1>including Hillary,</v>

258
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 1>were selected by Hans to explore a region known as the Khumbu icefall.</v>

259
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>This was an area of how sized blocks of ice that cracked and creaked.</v>

260
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>The claim has had to find a safe route for the Nepalese Sherpas who were to</v>

261
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>follow bringing suppliers a number of camps that were set up through the icefall</v>

262
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 1>that leads climbers press through the Khumbu icefall and set up advanced base</v>

263
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:04.404
<v Speaker 1>camp above it.</v>

264
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 1>But I now Hillary had impressed all with his boundless energy and exceptional</v>

265
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

266
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Early on in the morning of April,</v>

267
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>the 26 ads have teamed up with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay for the first time.</v>

268
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>That task was to reach an advanced camp.</v>

269
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 1>It was set up during the previous year's Swiss expedition ropes.</v>

270
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Together.</v>

271
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>The two men waded through deep,</v>

272
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 1>slushy snow that had a shortened with the sun's rays despite being hot and</v>

273
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>thirsty.</v>

274
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>The Path worked well together.</v>

275
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.491
<v Speaker 1>Arriving at the camp,</v>

276
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 1>they founds an unexpected treat.</v>

277
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>The Swiss had left behind some supplies,</v>

278
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>which included delicious gs all the way back to base camp.</v>

279
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Hilary boasted to Norgay that he could make it back within an hour all when's</v>

280
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>well until he decided to leap across a crevasse.</v>

281
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>He reached the other side,</v>

282
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but the edge of the crevasse broke off.</v>

283
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly he was slipping downwards and his fate was in the hands of his partner.</v>

284
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.091
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

285
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Norgay was a brilliant climber.</v>

286
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 1>He quickly grabbed a hold of the pole and he used all of his skill,</v>

287
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>strength and experience to help Hillary climb up to the side of the crevasse</v>

288
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 1>resenting to base camp.</v>

289
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>The bonds between the two men had been strengthened by Hilary's narrow escape</v>

290
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>and then reread to his parents that he had Norgay had become the Tigers of the</v>

291
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:05.801
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

292
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:06.634
<v Speaker 1>On that day.</v>

293
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>They had shown strength,</v>

294
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.171
<v Speaker 1>courage,</v>

295
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:09.004
<v Speaker 1>and fearlessness,</v>

296
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.460
<v Speaker 1>and they hoped that that would take them to the top of Everest.</v>

297
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.171
<v Speaker 1>By late May,</v>

298
00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>delete climbers had scaled the lots they face to the south called the flat area.</v>

299
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the nastiest places on Everest.</v>

300
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Yet they start out with the seventh camp.</v>

301
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>This was where they would make their final push to the summit to other climbers</v>

302
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 1>were selected to make first push,</v>

303
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>but they only made it to the lower south summit</v>

304
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:33.911
<v Speaker 1>on the morning of May,</v>

305
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>the 28th five more climbers set off from the south Cole,</v>

306
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 1>three lead climbers without a steps for the two men who had been picked to go</v>

307
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the top.</v>

308
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and Tenzing by nightfall.</v>

309
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>They help us a turns back and now it was up to the two of them.</v>

310
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and Tenzing pitched their tents below Everest south summit on an Aleve</v>

311
00:12:51.051 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>and Ice Ledge at 6:30 AM on May the 29th they began their final journey to the</v>

312
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 1>summit while climbing a steep slope.</v>

313
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>The surface no shifted carrying Hillary with us.</v>

314
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Then with their oxygen running low,</v>

315
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>the two men came to a rock face.</v>

316
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It was too slippery to try and climb hard rock in the crampons fitted to their</v>

317
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:06.790
<v Speaker 1>boots.</v>

318
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>They had to find another way.</v>

319
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Hilary sorta corners attached to a rock and it started to come away leaving your</v>

320
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:12.291
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>

321
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 1>stretching upwards between the rock and the ice.</v>

322
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 1>He crawled into the crack and grasping the rock in front of him.</v>

323
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 1>He pulled himself further in.</v>

324
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Drowning is crampons into the ice.</v>

325
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 1>He pulled himself through the crack at the top of the cornice and signaled to</v>

326
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Norgay to follow.</v>

327
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 1>They now continued along the Ridge hoping the summit would come into view just</v>

328
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 1>as Hillary doubt as if they could go on.</v>

329
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>He looked up and sort of sneaky peek that dropped away on all sides.</v>

330
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Hillary himself later recalled a few more whacks of the ice ax,</v>

331
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 1>a few more weary steps and we were on the summit.</v>

332
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It was now time to celebrate,</v>

333
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 1>to take photographs and appreciates and the best view in the wells.</v>

334
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Then use the terrorist did finally been conquered.</v>

335
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Reach the outside world on June.</v>

336
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 1>The second Ed was lionized as the beekeeper from rural New Zealand who had done</v>

337
00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the impossible from Nepal.</v>

338
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:57.460
<v Speaker 1>He flew to London where he was appointed a nice commander of the British Empire</v>

339
00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 1>by the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth the second he resides in New Zealand as a</v>

340
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>conquering hero with thousands flooding the streets to get a glimpse of him for</v>

341
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the awkward and shy young man that he was this unexpected adulation.</v>

342
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to get used to a few months after conquering Everest,</v>

343
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Hillary made under the conquest he won over and married Louise,</v>

344
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Mary Rose.</v>

345
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.271
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

346
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>however he needed help,</v>

347
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>he was so shy that he had to rely on his mother in law to propose on his behalf.</v>

348
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 1>This union later produce three children,</v>

349
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Peter,</v>

350
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>

351
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>and Belinda.</v>

352
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Peter would become a client and just like his father reaching the summit of</v>

353
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Everest himself in 1990 both Hillary and Tenzing continued climbing with</v>

354
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>

355
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.840
<v Speaker 1>tackling 10 more Himalayan peaks over the next decade.</v>

356
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 1>On January the fourth 1958 he led an expedition to Antarctica following the</v>

357
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>route of Robert Falcon Scott.</v>

358
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:44.740
<v Speaker 1>In 1912 the New Zealanders became the first to make the track in motorized</v>

359
00:14:44.741 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 1>vehicles with ad writing attractor.</v>

360
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Henrie later became an unofficial ambassador for New Zealand's in the 1970s he</v>

361
00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>commentated on the several and you went talk ticks sightseeing flights.</v>

362
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 1>On November the 28th 1979 he was booked to work on flight nine oh one but had to</v>

363
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 1>renege due to other work commitments.</v>

364
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 1>That flight crashed into a mountain in Antarctica with everyone on board being</v>

365
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:05.474
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

366
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.240
<v Speaker 1>As the years went by,</v>

367
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Hillary returned increasingly to Nepal.</v>

368
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Then he became absorbed in programs of fundraising and building work for shatter</v>

369
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.270
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

370
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.820
<v Speaker 1>In 1960 he established the Himalayan trust,</v>

371
00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:22.120
<v Speaker 1>which was responsible for the building of many schools and hospitals throughout</v>

372
00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.650
<v Speaker 1>a remote Himalayan areas.</v>

373
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Hillary received terrible news though.</v>

374
00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:29.530
<v Speaker 1>In 1975 tragedy struck with his wife and daughter Belinda being killed in a</v>

375
00:15:29.531 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>plane crash while flying to join him in the Pool Devastated Hillary and must</v>

376
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:34.330
<v Speaker 1>himself and his building work.</v>

377
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:34.780
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

378
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.720
<v Speaker 1>this was becoming increasingly difficult as he was getting more and more</v>

379
00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:38.554
<v Speaker 1>altitude sick.</v>

380
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Henry's health deteriorated in the late 1990s on January the 11th 2008 his heart</v>

381
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.710
<v Speaker 1>finally gave out.</v>

382
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.710
<v Speaker 1>He died at the Auckland City hospital from cardiac arrest.</v>

383
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.550
<v Speaker 1>His country,</v>

384
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.230
<v Speaker 1>they went into mourning at a state funeral,</v>

385
00:15:50.231 --> 00:15:51.940
<v Speaker 1>was held on January the 20 seconds,</v>

386
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.833
<v Speaker 1>two months later,</v>

387
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:57.370
<v Speaker 1>a Thanksgiving service was held in his honor at some George's chapel in Windsor</v>

388
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Castle standing guard outside the chapel with Gurkha soldiers from Nepal showing</v>
