<v Speaker 1>Robert E.</v>

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

3
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

4
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.720
<v Speaker 1>the mere mention of his name was enough to arouse passionate debate in his time.</v>

5
00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:08.200
<v Speaker 1>He was loved and respected by both the confederate army and the southern people.</v>

6
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Curiously,</v>

7
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>following the civil war,</v>

8
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>this high admiration carried over to include the people of the north and Lee</v>

9
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>became a cherished figure for all Americans during the war.</v>

10
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>When Abraham Lincoln looked at a picture of Lee,</v>

11
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 1>he remarked that a man with such compassionate countenance had to be a good man,</v>

12
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but the water which he devoted his every fiber broken,</v>

13
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>if not in spirit,</v>

14
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>certainly in body.</v>

15
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And he was only to outlive the conflicts.</v>

16
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>By five years into these biographics,</v>

17
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:37.330
<v Speaker 1>we discover the man who was Robert E.</v>

18
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

19

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.870

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Lee was born on January the 19th 1807 at Stratford hall plantation in</v>

22
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Westmoreland County,</v>

23
00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.000

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.910

30
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>and he fled Virginia and his family never to return.</v>

31
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it was raised by his mother,</v>

32
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33

35
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.820

<v Speaker 1>which produced intelligence that led to American victories.</v>

46
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>During this period,</v>

47
00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>the military had no medals for bravery,</v>

48
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>so officers were given brevet promotions for brave deeds during warfare APP.</v>

55
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:22.851
<v Speaker 1>the political term.</v>

56
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>All it was about to engulf the nation while he was on leave.</v>

57
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>From his position in Texas,</v>

58
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>John Brown attacker to the armor is Harper's ferry and events that clearly set</v>

59
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>the nation on the road to walk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>President Buchanan calls on leads take command of a small federal force that</v>

61
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>would be responsible for bringing the situation under control,</v>

62
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Lee and a future subordinate.</v>

63
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>He was also on leave.</v>

64
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Jaeb Stewart took command of a small group of marines and it's captured the</v>

66
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>contemporaries in the army was placed in a difficult situation as it became</v>

67
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>obvious that the southern states plan to defend themselves with arms general.</v>

68
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:58.481
<v Speaker 1>Winfield,</v>

69
00:02:58.481 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>

70
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the aging patriarch of the army.</v>

71
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.391
<v Speaker 1>Aj Lincoln,</v>

72
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:01.541
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

73
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Awfully commander of the army.</v>

74
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Learning of this offer at least struggles with the definition of duty does it</v>

75
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>meant everything to him as an officer in the United States army.</v>

76
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.450
<v Speaker 1>On April the 19th 1861 after Virginia had quit the union,</v>

78
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Robert E.</v>

79
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Lee face the most difficult decision of his life.</v>

80
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It's kept him up all night pacing the wooden floor and the visit Arlington</v>

81
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Mansion.</v>

82
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Lee's daughter Mary courteously recalls this that night.</v>

83
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Arlington was like a place where a death,</v>

84
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 1>a ACAT.</v>

85
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>The death in question was the end of a brilliant military Korea.</v>

86
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Lee's wife,</v>

87
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>

88
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>they to wrote,</v>

89
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>my husband's has wept tears of blood over this terrible war,</v>

90
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 1>but as a man of honor and does a Virginian,</v>

91
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 1>he must follow the destiny of his State is what was the severest struggle of his</v>

92
00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

93
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you resign a commission he had held for 30 years to accept the command would</v>

94
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly mean fighting against his native Virginia and the south.</v>

95
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Something that he simply couldn't bring himself to do.</v>

96
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Resignation from the army was also a difficult choice to make and it does.</v>

97
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>He wrestled with his decision.</v>

98
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.130
<v Speaker 1>He was attended by the prospects of bloodshed on either side.</v>

99
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.881
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

100
00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 1>he decided to resign his commission in the army and attempt to to avoid service</v>

101
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:17.880
<v Speaker 1>with either side in the forthcoming conflict,</v>

102
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Lee himself wrote with all my devotion to the union and the feeling of loyalty</v>

103
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>and duty of an American citizen,</v>

104
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I have not been able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives,</v>

105
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.853
<v Speaker 1>my children,</v>

106
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 1>my home.</v>

107
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I have that for resigned my commission in the army except in the defense of my</v>

108
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:33.864
<v Speaker 1>native state.</v>

109
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I hope to never draw my sword again.</v>

110
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>This statements was to prove to be prophetic.</v>

111
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.970
<v Speaker 1>On Monday,</v>

112
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.150
<v Speaker 1>they bought the 22nd 1861 Lee left his home at Arlington,</v>

113
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>never to return within two weeks,</v>

114
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:44.791
<v Speaker 1>union troops,</v>

115
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>they occupied to south Mary Hams there for girls.</v>

116
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>They were vagabonds of war.</v>

117
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 1>His three sons were soldiers in gray.</v>

118
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>While Lee was in Richmond planning the defense of Virginia.</v>

119
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>The general belief among politicians in the south was that the war would be</v>

120
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>short,</v>

121
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>but Lee,</v>

122
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>he believed otherwise he status.</v>

123
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.010
<v Speaker 1>If it comes to a conflict of arms,</v>

124
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.230
<v Speaker 1>the war will last at least four years.</v>

125
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Northern politicians do not appreciate the determination and pluck of the south</v>

126
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.950
<v Speaker 1>and southern politicians do not appreciate the numbers,</v>

127
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.821
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

128
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.451
<v Speaker 1>and it's patient.</v>

129
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Perseverance of the north.</v>

130
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Both sides forgets we are all Americans.</v>

131
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I foresee that the country will have to pass through a terrible ordeal,</v>

132
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.430
<v Speaker 1>a necessary expiation perhaps for our national sins.</v>

133
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.343
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

134
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>During the early days of the warrior,</v>

135
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>it became apparent to me that the south would fight a defensive war and that is</v>

136
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>beloved Virginia would become the major battlefield of that war.</v>

137
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He accepted a commission as a commander of Virginia.</v>

138
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:44.681
<v Speaker 1>His troops,</v>

139
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>and we're seeing commission does a brigadier general in the confederate army.</v>

140
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>He remains in relativity obscure positions during the first year of the war as</v>

141
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>he gained his earliest experiences in the civil war in the mountainous region of</v>

142
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>western Virginia.</v>

143
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>The poor weather combines with the political infighting between two of</v>

145
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Virginia's former governors.</v>

146
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Now generals resulted in disastrous military failures for the confederacy.</v>

147
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.781
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>

148
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>he was attacked in southern newspapers,</v>

149
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>is evacuating Leeann's granny leaves his hand runs,</v>

150
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>isn't ubid tens gray during the tension filled bouncing campaigns please.</v>

151
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Next assignment.</v>

152
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>It was on the Carolina Sea coast where he was responsible for building defenses</v>

153
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>to prevents launch scale union army attacks from the seat.</v>

154
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>He placed his strong defensive positions upstream where shallow rivers could not</v>

155
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>be easily navigated by the union.</v>

156
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Navy.</v>

157
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Lee's ability as a military engineer was proved by the fact that his defenses</v>

158
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>will have to last for much of the war.</v>

159
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>He was also nicknames the king of spades because of the construction work that</v>

160
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.434
<v Speaker 1>he managed.</v>

161
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.131
<v Speaker 1>His detractors.</v>

162
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

163
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>what seems to realize their mistake and misjudging this aggressive officer,</v>

164
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>what is West Point classmates and Joseph [inaudible] Johnson was severely</v>

165
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>wounded at the battle of seven pines.</v>

166
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1862 linguists placed in commands of what would soon become the</v>

167
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 1>legendary army of Northern Virginia as union general George Mcclellan advanced</v>

168
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>towards the new confederate capital Lee auditors' mandate to begin digging</v>

169
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>defenses for Richmond's giving new credence to one of his nicknames,</v>

170
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but he soon was to demonstrate the audacious side of his military personality.</v>

171
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Leah initiated the seven days campaign on June the 25th 1862 and he had soon it</v>

172
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>pushed the union army from the outskirts of Richmond.</v>

173
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 1>By August 29th he and his army were positioned to do battle as Manassas,</v>

174
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:21.591
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>

175
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>where he defeated the Union army for a second time before invading Maryland's.</v>

176
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>This new commands of the confederate army had completely changed the military</v>

177
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

178
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>In only a few weeks.</v>

179
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.851
<v Speaker 1>In June,</v>

180
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the entire union army had been poised to attack Richmond's,</v>

181
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>but by September he was in a position from which you could threaten Washington,</v>

182
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>DC.</v>

183
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Lee's army fought to a stalemate at the battle of Antietam and on September the</v>

184
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>17th and withdrew to the southern side of the potter Mac in December,</v>

185
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:50.351
<v Speaker 1>but he was able to conclude the 1862 campaign with a major victory of Ambrose</v>

186
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Burnside's Union forces at Fredericksburg,</v>

187
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>

188
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>sending the northern army reeling back to their basis now Washington Lee and</v>

189
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>this hard marching subordinate,</v>

190
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>stonewall Jackson were able to defeat a larger union army under Joseph Hooker at</v>

191
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Chancellorsville in the first campaign of 1863 but the victory was costly.</v>

192
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Jackson was fatally wounded by his own men while conducting a personal</v>

193
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>recognizance of the enemy's lines.</v>

194
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 1>This was actually a common feature of good confederate commanders.</v>

195
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>They would actually conduct that own recognizance during a lull in the battle</v>

196
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>viewed as unnecessary bravado by some historians.</v>

197
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 1>This was actually a key to the successful operations of the confederate</v>

198
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>commanders and Lee himself frequently under Tareq of these hazardous operations.</v>

199
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Favorite sounds from a personal battlefield reconnaissance.</v>

200
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 1>That second Manassas with a mark on his face where a sharp shooters,</v>

201
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>bullets at grace,</v>

202
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Devon lease immediate reactions of the death of his most trusted officer was</v>

203
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>that it was God's wealth and the Lord would raise someone else up to Jackson's</v>

204
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>place and that's hope.</v>

205
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

206
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.743
<v Speaker 1>he was mistaken,</v>

207
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Lee would just have to do the best he could by himself.</v>

208
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>At Chancellorsville.</v>

209
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>These cemented his reputation as a brilliant brilliance battlefield commander.</v>

210
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>It was a battle that seemingly on paper he could not win,</v>

211
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>outnumbered this two to one.</v>

212
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>He's still divided his army in half in the face of the enemy.</v>

213
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>He won the battle in spectacular fashion and it was undoubtedly has most famous</v>

214
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>

215
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>The victory of Chancellorsville cleared the way for another confederate invasion</v>

216
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>of the north confusion within the Union army combined with the losses of the</v>

217
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>earlier basil gave,</v>

218
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>leave the opportunity.</v>

219
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>He longed for a chance to destroy the union army in a classic and Napoleonic</v>

220
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>battle that would end the civil war.</v>

221
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>This was a high risk operation,</v>

222
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:24.560
<v Speaker 1>but Lee placed great faith in the ability of his army of northern Virginia and</v>

223
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>to get his bag.</v>

224
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 1>This is where he would attempt to do it again.</v>

225
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

226
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.350
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1863 lead boldly moved his army of nearly 60,000 men into union</v>

227
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

228
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.550
<v Speaker 1>His plan was to destroy as many military posts does he could in Maryland and</v>

229
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:47.384
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>

230
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>While the Union army was forced to defend Washington DC,</v>

231
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.090
<v Speaker 1>a key target Swisscom curtain just outside of Harrisburg,</v>

232
00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:53.924
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>

233
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.570
<v Speaker 1>This was the largest military supply depot in the north.</v>

234
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I think his main aim was not to defeat to the union army militarily,</v>

235
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.910
<v Speaker 1>but to bring the water and ends politically.</v>

236
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.660
<v Speaker 1>He believed that a massive defeat in the north would encourage people to lose</v>

237
00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:07.610
<v Speaker 1>faith in the warm and demand it's cents.</v>

238
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.121
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

239
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:10.070
<v Speaker 1>as the confederate forces move north,</v>

240
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:11.570
<v Speaker 1>a skirmish erupted in Gettysburg,</v>

241
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania between opposing cavalry units,</v>

242
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.820
<v Speaker 1>legal word of the skirmish and were startled to be informed.</v>

243
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a major union force was closing it on Guettas back.</v>

244
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Instead of sending a cavalry reconnaissance force to confirm the report,</v>

245
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.060
<v Speaker 1>he sent his entire army to mobilize.</v>

246
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.780
<v Speaker 1>This is something that history would record as a colossal mistake.</v>

247
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.591
<v Speaker 1>The audit,</v>

248
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>all of his forces to converge at cash down that small village seven miles from</v>

249
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>gutters back.</v>

250
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the 60,000 confederates port.</v>

251
00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:40.280
<v Speaker 1>In around 3000 union soldiers took position on Macpherson Ridge.</v>

252
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.330
<v Speaker 1>These men trying to hold off the onslaught of rebel soldiers until help arrived,</v>

253
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but reinforcements were miles away.</v>

254
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:47.510
<v Speaker 1>In Washington DC,</v>

255
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.470
<v Speaker 1>the union soldiers,</v>

256
00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:51.200
<v Speaker 1>they were forced to withdraw southeast on the cemetery Ridge,</v>

257
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.030
<v Speaker 1>a range of hills on the outskirts of Gettysburg that forms the shape of a fish</v>

258
00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:55.580
<v Speaker 1>hook.</v>

259
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.030
<v Speaker 1>This position provided an extremely strong defensive advantage.</v>

260
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Lee immediately saw the danger in the strength of the union position,</v>

261
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but because of his numerical superiority,</v>

262
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.230
<v Speaker 1>he believed that the enemy was vulnerable.</v>

263
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.710
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

264
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>union forces sooner arrived and strengthens their defensive position.</v>

265
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Though it was nowhere near Lee's bass campaign,</v>

266
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>much of what happened to get his bag,</v>

267
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:16.730
<v Speaker 1>we're still remarkable from a southern perspective,</v>

268
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Lee was our numbers ends without much of his cavalry.</v>

269
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.820
<v Speaker 1>The cavalry was used largely for reconnaissance in order to find the enemy and</v>

270
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 1>establish his size and strength.</v>

271
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.210
<v Speaker 1>But Lee's calvary regiments were in the process of reading the entire union army</v>

272
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 1>rather than gathering information and screening the flanks of Lee's army,</v>

273
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 1>and he was also without his most trusted officer at general,</v>

274
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Stonewall Jackson,</v>

275
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.250
<v Speaker 1>who had been killed at Chancellorsville six weeks earlier,</v>

276
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.240
<v Speaker 1>still let you failed to adjust your strategy to the situation on the grounds he</v>

277
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:47.720
<v Speaker 1>refused to retreat even when the situation was clearly hopeless.</v>

278
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.080
<v Speaker 1>After three days of terrible fighting and unprecedented losses,</v>

279
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the confederates were forced to withdraw from the fields and to make a hasty</v>

280
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>retreat from the northern territory.</v>

281
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>As the survivors of the disastrous attack that history remembers,</v>

282
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>his pickets challenge came fleeing back to the southern position,</v>

283
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 1>the general road among the men trying to console them and admitting that it was</v>

284
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>all his faults.</v>

285
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 1>In later reflection,</v>

286
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.350
<v Speaker 1>they admitted that he had simply asked too much of his men at Gettysburg.</v>

287
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>

288
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.660
<v Speaker 1>no blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was</v>

289
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>projected by me.</v>

290
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I am alone to blame.</v>

291
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Gettysburg was Lee's greatest wartime disappointments in its way.</v>

292
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>He tended his resignation as you confederate President Jefferson Davis rising.</v>

293
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.053
<v Speaker 1>Mr President.</v>

294
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>No one is more than myself and my inability for the duties of my position.</v>

295
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I cannot even accomplish what I myself desire.</v>

296
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 1>How can I fulfill the expectations of others?</v>

297
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.060
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

298
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I sensibly feel v growing failure of my bodily strength.</v>

299
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 1>This was no idle self pitying,</v>

300
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:42.821
<v Speaker 1>the civil war,</v>

301
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:45.020
<v Speaker 1>and in particular the battle of Gettysburg Broccoli.</v>

302
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Physically.</v>

303
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>There is good evidence that to just before the Bassel he actually had a heart</v>

304
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:49.410
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

305
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:49.751
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

306
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Davis refused to accept his resignation knowing that the man was irreplaceable.</v>

307
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Following Gettysburg,</v>

308
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the retreated across the potter Mac never to return to the north again.</v>

309
00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.171
<v Speaker 1>The following spring,</v>

310
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 1>a new Yankee general came to the fields to fight leap.</v>

311
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 1>His name was Ulysses Simpson grants.</v>

312
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.231
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

313
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:08.500
<v Speaker 1>the North had founds a worthy contender for the great confederate general.</v>

314
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Unlike many of his predecessors,</v>

315
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>groms was not covered by lead.</v>

316
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Both men underestimated each other,</v>

317
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 1>seemed discovering that their opponents was different from anyone else that had</v>

318
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>ever been up against.</v>

319
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Immediately upon taking commands at grant issued the following commands do</v>

320
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:21.604
<v Speaker 1>general needs,</v>

321
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>commander of the army of the potter Mac Lee's army will be your objective points</v>

322
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 1>wherever ligos there you will go.</v>

323
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:28.714
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

324
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 1>grants relentlessly pursued Lee from the wilderness to Spotsylvania and then to</v>

325
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>cold harbor wearing terrible slaughter took place throughout the bloody campaign</v>

326
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and despite heavy losses,</v>

327
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Lee Galleon Lee led his army on May the sixth 1864 is his line was wavering.</v>

328
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.480
<v Speaker 1>He himself rode to the front and demanded that his men stand their ground on the</v>

329
00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous circumstances.</v>

330
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 1>After June,</v>

331
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>1864 Lee's army of northern Virginia had been pushed back to the defenses of</v>

332
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Richmond's and back.</v>

333
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.671
<v Speaker 1>Effectively.</v>

334
00:13:54.671 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Grants had taken him out of the war,</v>

335
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 1>unable to maneuver and know where to go or they could do now was wait and to</v>

336
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 1>react as grant circling around him,</v>

337
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 1>access with his army besieged and pin down the knew that the end was in sight.</v>

338
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Lee's anguish while being hemmed up at Petersburg was heightens with the news</v>

339
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that his home in Arlington had been confiscated by the union governments having</v>

340
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>been seized for unpaid taxes.</v>

341
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 1>It was quickly converted into a large soldiers' cemetery.</v>

342
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Orders were given for the graves to be placed as close to the house as possible</v>

343
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 1>so that it could never be used again as a private dwelling.</v>

344
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.541
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

345
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:26.550
<v Speaker 1>the cruelest bro,</v>

346
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 1>but it was yet to come through the winter of 1864 Lee's army lacked forage</v>

347
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:34.600
<v Speaker 1>rations and supplies somehow managed to retain their fighting spirit,</v>

348
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>but even that's was to disappear in April of 1865 with his men that are near</v>

349
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>starvation point,</v>

350
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Lee led his bedraggled army to Appomattox courthouse in Virginia following a</v>

351
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 1>last desperate flight from Richmond and it was there that Lee surrendered his</v>

352
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 1>army and ended the civil war.</v>

353
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 1>The correspondence between grants and lead during those closing hours of the war</v>

354
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>is enlightening.</v>

355
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>On April the seventh grants sent the following message to leave general.</v>

356
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 1>The results of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further</v>

357
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>resistance in this struggle.</v>

358
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I regarded it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further</v>

359
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:09.470
<v Speaker 1>a fusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of the army of northern</v>

360
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

361
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Very respectfully.</v>

362
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>You s grants,</v>

363
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Lee's reply.</v>

364
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 1>It came swiftly.</v>

365
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 1>General grants though not entertaining the option you express on the</v>

366
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the army of northern Virginia.</v>

367
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless a fusion of bloods and therefore ask</v>

368
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 1>the terms you will offer in condition if it's surrender.</v>

369
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Very respectfully.</v>

370
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Robert E.</v>

371
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

372
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 1>On the morning of April the ninth Lee put on his best uniform and went to the</v>

373
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:37.280
<v Speaker 1>home of Wilmer Mclean where he met general grant.</v>

374
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 1>The two men contrasted sharply Lee six feet high,</v>

375
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 1>ends with faultless form and dress grants.</v>

376
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Five foot seven mud splatters as in a rumpled private,</v>

377
00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:46.820
<v Speaker 1>so uniform the terms of Sorento.</v>

378
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>While unexpectedly generous without demand for punishment,</v>

379
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the confederate army was allowed to go home on the provision that they would</v>

380
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 1>never take up arms again against the federal governments.</v>

381
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Many historians believed that it was a measure of grants respectfully,</v>

382
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 1>that he handled the terms the way he did.</v>

383
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>As he exited the Mclean House,</v>

384
00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Lee was chaired by the confederates and saluted by the union troops,</v>

385
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.940
<v Speaker 1>asked officer of the Union to remove his hat and saluted.</v>

386
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Lee was grants.</v>

387
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

388
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:18.960
<v Speaker 1>After the war,</v>

389
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.810
<v Speaker 1>he became president,</v>

390
00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:21.420
<v Speaker 1>so of Washington College in Lexington,</v>

391
00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

392
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.681
<v Speaker 1>During those years,</v>

393
00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:26.010
<v Speaker 1>he also found time to write his memoir and in it he stated the following,</v>

394
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I did only what my duty demanded.</v>

395
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I could have taken no other course without dishonor,</v>

396
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.850
<v Speaker 1>and if at all were to be done over again,</v>

397
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I should act in precisely the same manner.</v>

398
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.680
<v Speaker 1>He dedicated his last years to education.</v>

399
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.880
<v Speaker 1>On September the 28th 1870 he went to a school meeting on the way home and he</v>

400
00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:42.714
<v Speaker 1>caught a Kohl's.</v>

401
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.800
<v Speaker 1>14 days later,</v>

402
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.610
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>

403
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.270
<v Speaker 1>The huge funeral service at Lexington was attended by thousands of Americans</v>

404
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.130
<v Speaker 1>from both the north and the south.</v>

405
