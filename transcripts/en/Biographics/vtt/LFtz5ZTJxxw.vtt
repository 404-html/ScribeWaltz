5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.193
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.490
<v 0>It is one of the greatest nations in the world.</v>

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.750
Germany is the linchpin of the European Union and the economic powerhouse that's

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.420
also homes,

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.150
one of the world's top creative capital's despite a history scarred by two world

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:38.040
wars and a 45 years of partition under a communist dictatorship.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.220
It's a nation that's consistently been at the center of global affairs for 150

12
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.760
years and it only exists because of one man.

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.720
When all way von Bismarck was born,
Germany was a collection of 39 weeks.

14
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.920
States cowering between the superpowers of France,
Austria,

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.990
and Russia.
By the time he died,

16
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:02.991
the German nation had been forged in blood and iron and central Europe had a new

17
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.690
sheriff in town.
But while we all know the modern Germany,

18
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.650
he gave us a few of us know much about Bismarck himself.
In this video,

19
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.430
we take a look at the man known to history as the iron chancellor,

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.950
and just before we get into the main part of the video today,

21
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.490
I do want to say that there are a lot of Ziad German pronunciations.

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.580
If I screw them up,
I apologize.

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.853
<v 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.130
<v 0>What else do von Bismarck was born in the Prussian village of Sean housing on</v>

25
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:37.600
April the first 1815 it was into a wells that had been shattered by war,

26
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.580
not 10 years before Napoleon's grands.

27
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:43.750
Army had come storming through central Europe,
destroying the holy Roman Empire.

28
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.720
Ins leaving the Germanic states in ruins.

29
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.650
Bismarck's own home of pressure had been deeply humiliated by a French military

30
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.380
occupation,
not the young auto was aware of any of this.

31
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.420
Less than three months after he was born,

32
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.090
Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo for baby.
Also,

33
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:02.170
Napoleon's defeat meant being able to grow up on his parents' estate without
war.

34
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.980
I asked the right estate does why the image would lead to cultivate as a man of

35
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:09.310
the people.
I'll say von Bismarck came from the Prussian nobility.

36
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.850
His father was a young car,
kind of minor aristocrats.

37
00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:15.850
While his mother came from a family of middle class professionals.

38
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.460
It's still money does not equal comfort.

39
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.380
Aged seven auto strict mother sent him away to school in the Prussian capital of

40
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:27.530
Berlin and experience.
There's also absolutely hated it.

41
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.140
He hated it so much in fact that the experience gave him a lifelong loading of

42
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:35.350
strong women like his mother.
While also he was siting in Berlin.

43
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.660
Europe was trying to rebuild itself after Napoleon,

44
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.650
the destruction of the thousand year old holy Roman empire had left a void in

45
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:43.850
the center of the consonants to fill it to the surviving.

46
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.930
So you have hours created something called the German Confederation,

47
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:51.280
a collection of 39 states locked in a loose association.

48
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.010
The confederation was designed to be weak.

49
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.090
It's power was balanced between the Catholic Austrian empire in the South and

50
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:02.440
the Protestant kingdom pressure where Otto von Bismarck was born in the north.

51
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.150
Now as we run through Bismark's life,

52
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:08.530
it's important to remember there was nothing at this stage that even remotely

53
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.580
resembled modern Germany.
When you hear us say Bismarck studied in Hanover,

54
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.880
it wasn't like you moving from say Colorado to Washington.

55
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.020
It was literally like moving to another country or be as one where they just

56
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:21.310
happened to speak the same language.

57
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.790
This language thing was why people started wondering why there were 39 Germanic

58
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.460
states and instead of one United Germany,

59
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.430
but that's something we're going to get to in a moment.
For now.

60
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.190
All you need to know is that also answered,
got again,

61
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:38.191
university and Hanover and the 1830s and he studied to be a lawyer remarkably

62
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.920
for such a great man.
He was useless as a student.

63
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.850
His friends considered him a dandy.
His tutors is considered him a drunk.

64
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.240
He scraped through his course and joins the Prussian civil service,

65
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.080
terminally boring occupation.
In fact,
it was so boring.

66
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.890
The Bismark wrote the pressure and civil servants is like one musician in an

67
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.380
orchestra.
He's confined to his own.

68
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.670
This part I however want to make my own music.

69
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.870
It's a quote Bismarck fans,
uh,
fond of because it points to his future greatness.

70
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.460
At the time though,
that future greatness,
it was very much in doubt.

71
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.280
This is mark actually quit the civil service in 1839 after his mother died and

72
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.750
he returned to his father's estate.

73
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.240
He briefly became a Bible thumping evangelical before marrying the pious you of

74
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.660
and put comma and living as just another Russian farmer.

75
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.520
The one notable thing that he did came in 1847 when he was sent to the Prussian

76
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.480
parliaments and made a number of speeches attacking the nation's Jews and this

77
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.680
stage in his early thirties he really was written more than a random hick from

78
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.820
Pomerania.
So you might know the saying come with the hour,
cometh the mat.
Well,

79
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:44.680
no one in 1847 Europe,
new as,

80
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:49.270
but the hour was very near the upon them and the man,
he was already there

81
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.700
in the library of European history.

82
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.590
1848 isn't the the giant red volume titled World.

83
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.180
On February the 20 seconds eight French government ban against banquets led to a

84
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.230
Paris uprising,

85
00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:11.280
which depose the king belly three weeks later on march the 12th or similar

86
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:14.190
uprising and Vianna toppled Clemons.
Von,
Matt and Nick,

87
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.940
the guy who had been holding Europe together since Napoleon's defeat.

88
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.110
It was a spread of revolutionary it contagion of uprisings.

89
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.400
Often Matt and nick fell.
Nowhere was safe within days.

90
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:27.900
Berlin was paralyzed by riots,

91
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:31.950
which nearly brought down the conservative Prussian King Friedrich fill home the

92
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:32.640
fourth.

93
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.410
It was only by promising a slew of liberal reforms that Friedrich Wilhelm was

94
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.950
able to cling on to his power.
One of those reforms.
Well,

95
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:44.250
people could now discuss the possibility of uniting Germany.

96
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.710
For a guy who's famous for uniting Germany,

97
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:48.990
you might be surprised to hear Autobahn Bismarck wants it.

98
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.630
No pass of this nationalist revolution.

99
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.350
While liberals in pressure and other German states were holding elections and

100
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:58.370
creating a parliaments or write a new pan jam and constitution,

101
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.290
Bismarck was considering.
Arming,

102
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:04.610
has peasants and marching on Berlin zoo preserve Prussian sovereignty.

103
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.181
In the end,

104
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.420
the Bismarck settled for using his position in the pressure parliament to become

105
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.090
one of the loudest anti-revolutionary is in Europe.

106
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.930
The thing you've got to remember is that Germany had never really been a thing

107
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.430
before for Bismarck uniting all 39 states in the German Confederation meant

108
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:23.630
sending his beloved Protestant pressure into a support player in a nation

109
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.750
dominated by the Catholic Austrians.
On top of that,

110
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.110
the guys in are pushing to unite.
Germany were all middle class liberals.
Well,

111
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.190
Bismarck was a rate ultra conservative aristocracy.
He loved his king.

112
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.330
He loved goes and he loved to order for,

113
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:39.110
there's mark 1848 must have been a bit of a living hell,

114
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.280
but that's turbulent year.
It did provide Bismarck with one important boost.

115
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.840
It brought Bismarck firmly to Friedrich Ville home.
The fourths attention,

116
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.220
if they're on the revolution.

117
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.460
Bismarck was one of the most probe on men in Prussia.

118
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.730
Even when it seems the old order was amount to be swept away.

119
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.720
He claimed that stubbornly to the past like a reactionary Gemini limpets.

120
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.570
So when the forces of counter revolution,

121
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:07.310
finally our control in 1849 there's mark was perfectly placed to reap the

122
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:11.660
rewards as the revolutions failed in Prussia Australia Ahrens elsewhere,

123
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.690
thousands of gem and liberals were forced to flee to America.

124
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.870
By 1851 the old order had been completely restored.

125
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.440
If his services to the pressure and crown Bismarck was made ambassador to the

126
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:21.651
city.

127
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.570
State of frank fat's of old of the country's rocked by 1848 only one underwent

128
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.970
permanent change in France where it's a dual kicks off the old Monica.

129
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.320
His daughter was destroyed in its place.
A President Roosevelt,

130
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.820
who soon would become an emperor.
His name was Napoleon,
the third.

131
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:40.490
And if you've already seen a biographics video on him,

132
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.730
you'll know he and Lt von Bismarck wed destined to collide with enough force to

133
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.450
reshape the consonants.

134
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.240
On September the 30th 1862 a giant of a man slowly number to his feet and the

135
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:03.080
Prussian parliaments and he delivered a speech that would change European

136
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.380
history at six foot four and with a bodybuilder,

137
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.910
not unlike a particular type of brick outhouse.

138
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.120
Otto von Bismarck was a presence that always commanded attention,

139
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.720
but on this day it was his words rather than his size.

140
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:17.570
All volcanic temper that set everyone talking.

141
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.440
In the 11 years since 1851 Bismarck had been serving as Friedrich Ville.

142
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.660
Hamza ambassadors of the capitals of Europe had been in frank fet.

143
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.400
Some peaches SPEC had even briefly then stationed in the court of Napoleon,

144
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.390
the third in Paris,

145
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.010
and being so close to the levers of power had given him time to think slowly.

146
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.430
Bismarck could come to the realization that the world was changing whether he

147
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:40.220
liked it or not.
Men's dreams of a United Germany,

148
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:44.570
they hadn't died with 1848 and the Catholic Austrians were ascendant in the

149
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:48.920
German confederation,
even without a union.
Either the pressure drives,
stood,

150
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:49.551
bond watched.

151
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:53.690
The liberals and the Austrians dreams come true or he'd beat them at their own

152
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:54.410
game.

153
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.310
It was from these musings that Bismark's famous blood and iron speech sprang on

154
00:08:59.311 --> 00:08:59.730
that day.

155
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.500
September the 30th 1862 Bismarck was in a precarious position roughly a year

156
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:05.640
before Friedrich Ville home.

157
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:10.050
The false a died and the Prussian crown had pasta is dull and to dimwitted son

158
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.020
Phil home the fast before 12 months past fell,

159
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.350
how accidentally spa to crisis that nearly toppled is governments.

160
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.510
The short version is that he need to tax rises,

161
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:21.930
that the liberal dominated Prussian parliaments simply wasn't willing to pass

162
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.660
with it looking like another revolution might be on the cards.

163
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.430
Wilhelm panics and recalls his father's old acolytes Bismarck from Paris to

164
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:31.560
become precious Minnesota presidents.

165
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.160
No one expected Bismark to last eight weeks and now Harry was announced to

166
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:38.310
deliver his first major speech to a hostile parliaments.

167
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.340
Nobody could have predicted what a bombshell it would be and is booming.

168
00:09:42.341 --> 00:09:46.890
Germanic voice Bismark to clad the position of Prussia in Germany will not be

169
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:50.490
determined by its liberalism,
by its power.

170
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.810
He went on to say not three speeches and majority decisions will the great

171
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:59.811
questions of the day be decided that was the greatest mistake of 1848 and 1849

172
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.050
but by iron and blood for the first time.

173
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:08.700
Here we see Bismarck explicitly addressing the revolution of 1848 and not as

174
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:10.920
something horrific and to be forgotten,

175
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.150
but as something that was just done wrong.
Parliaments are trying,

176
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:18.810
talking and building a consensus and oldest had done was make chaos.

177
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.090
Now it was time to do it right.

178
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.210
It was time to unify Germany with iron and blood to be clearer on didn't just

179
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:30.180
mean war.
It meant rapid industrialization,

180
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.920
immense pressure that was building ships and bridges and railways so fast that

181
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:39.750
it could catch up with person and in France.
But yes it also did mean war.

182
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.710
Nobody in the parliaments new but Bismarck was about to embark on three great

183
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:48.711
was that would take Germany from 39 shattered states to a single BMF on

184
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:51.030
depression control.
So the neighbor was in parliament,

185
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.280
they on blood was the last thing they wanted to hear.

186
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.150
They tried to false veil home the faster remove his new minister president from

187
00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:57.660
power,

188
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.290
even refusing to work with him when this marketing and collecting new taxes

189
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.370
without their approval.

190
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.670
Now that this bothered to Bismarck Pedro town to Prussia with a plan to forge

191
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:10.200
Germany and is conservative and Protestant image and the wheels forged from the

192
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:13.140
strongest on.
We're already in motion.
Okay,

193
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:16.080
so good news everybody whereabouts it gets into the war part of his life,

194
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:19.650
which I know you will love.
Well currently very popular on this channel,

195
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.490
but first skill shaft and so on.

196
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.990
Are you ready for a silky smooth transition because maybe in a test leadership

197
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:25.470
skills,

198
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.370
pretty important for all Bismarck and leadership skills as something you can

199
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:32.900
learn on skill shaft.
How about that presentation?

200
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.450
Essential is career development,
communication skills,
body language,

201
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.920
all on skill shot,

202
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:41.040
but it's not just the leadership skill set isn't online nine in community with

203
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:43.080
more than 22,000 courses.

204
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.870
Every time I make one of these ads it seems like the bands are like a thousand

205
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.520
new courses.
It's impressive.

206
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.680
They have clauses from design to business technology and much more so you know a

207
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:55.150
lot of online learning platforms.
They'd charge you by the course,

208
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.310
which can get pretty pricey after a while.

209
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.680
If you're like learning premium membership with skillshare though,

210
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.310
it lets you dive into any course you want so you can learn all of the leadership

211
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:07.420
skills you one so you know that other stuff I mentioned like technology or I

212
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:11.770
mean they've even got culinary skills,
languages this a lot to learn.
For me,

213
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.040
I've learned about video making on skillshare useful for what I do.

214
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.600
You can learn it.
Whatever you like.

215
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.420
Learning new skills is one of the most important things you can do to get ahead

216
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:22.420
and skillshare makes that super easy and super affordable.

217
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:24.040
Since skillshare is sponsoring this video,

218
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:27.160
the first 500 people to click the link in the description below,

219
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.110
you can get two whole months of skillshare for free and let's get on to that
war.

220
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:32.944
Shall We?

221
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.120
The British prime minister,
Lord Palmerston,
once remarked,

222
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.520
only three people I've ever really understood the Schloss vague Holstine

223
00:12:46.521 --> 00:12:50.150
business,
the prince consort who is dead,
a German professor.

224
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.750
It was gone mad and I who have forgotten all about it.

225
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.570
All of this is just our way of saying that you don't need to worry about the

226
00:12:56.571 --> 00:12:59.330
super complicated backgrounds or their second Schultz vague war.

227
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.910
All you need to know is that Schultz,
vague and Holstine,

228
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.560
where two regions on the border between the German Confederation and Denmark and

229
00:13:06.561 --> 00:13:11.000
to this on February the first 1864 Bismarck convinced the Austrians do join him

230
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.860
in invading them.
The second release,

231
00:13:12.861 --> 00:13:16.880
big war today is seen as the beginning of the German wars of unification.

232
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.460
More or less,
everything went according to Bismark's plan pressure and Austria,

233
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.770
Starbucks or Denmark occupied the peninsula and within months a taken control of

234
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.140
Charlottesville.
Holstine,
Holstine went to Austria.

235
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.290
I'll shawls speak when it's a pressure.
In the 21st century,

236
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:33.110
it's fashionable for historians to debates where the Bismarck really wasn't

237
00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:35.810
genius,
so just extraordinarily lucky.

238
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.990
It's certainly true that the sac controls big war was possible only thanks to a

239
00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:42.890
convenience succession crisis and shawls,
fake Holstine,

240
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.440
but Australia had no beef with stratospheric Holstine.

241
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.940
They didn't even want to innovate,

242
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.240
but Bismarck managed to convince Vienna that not joining his war.

243
00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:53.330
We'd make pressure too powerful in the German confederation,

244
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.110
so join us Australia did and move that cost the most of their allies just as

245
00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:00.890
Bismark wants it with Australia diplomatically isolated.

246
00:14:00.891 --> 00:14:02.990
Bismarck then checked in on his old friend of mine,

247
00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:07.130
a pony and the third to ask if Paris had any desire to protect the Ana when

248
00:14:07.131 --> 00:14:10.730
Napoleon,
the third was all like,
ah,
that's cool dude.

249
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.500
There's mark said about engineering.

250
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:17.300
His second major war in January of 1866 Bismarck founds a pre taxed in Austria

251
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:21.170
is administration of Holstein.
Again,
the INS and outs,
they don't really matter.

252
00:14:21.171 --> 00:14:25.040
What matters is the boundary in Austria and several German states including

253
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:28.520
Hanover,
ready for war with pressure.
This,

254
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.800
this was an exceptionally bad move.

255
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.520
The moment the starting gun fired on the seven weeks war pressures,
ultra modern,

256
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.120
ultra efficient army was bulldozing it's way across central Europe,

257
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.010
crushing everything in its path.

258
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.520
Seven weeks after the conflict exploded with the Austrian army,

259
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.910
the oscillator theaters back in Berlin Kaysville him,

260
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.170
he couldn't believe his luck.

261
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.720
He and his general staff could already envisage Prussian troops marching through

262
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.430
Vienna,
but that never happens.
Bismarck,
but is extremely heavy foot down.

263
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.630
That would be no march on Vianna,
no humiliating peace treaty for Austria.

264
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.640
All he wanted to do was forced Vienna.

265
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:05.990
It's a promise that they're never join a United Germany and if they agreed then

266
00:15:05.991 --> 00:15:08.480
any future Germany would naturally be dominated,

267
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:12.470
not by the Catholic Habsburgs but by the Protestant oppressions.

268
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.200
This practically gave Ville home a stroke.

269
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.850
The Kaiser was so ASM and Australia be crushed that Bismarck had to threaten to

270
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.040
throw himself from a fourth floor window.

271
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.730
If Wilhelm gave the order to march on Vienna in the end of his marks,

272
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:27.290
the atrics they carried the day,

273
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.660
the Australians agreed to leave the whole uniting Germany.

274
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:33.380
Things of Prussia and Vienna was left standing back in Berlin.

275
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.210
The two wars that made Biznaga Herrick,

276
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.570
even the Liberals who've tried to get him fired today now sung his praises.

277
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.640
The court has got even allows out when Bismarck,

278
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:45.440
annex slice Vic and Holstine and Hanover and forced every Germanic states north

279
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.021
of the river.

280
00:15:46.021 --> 00:15:51.021
Mine into is north German confederation by the ends of 1867 those 39 Germanic

281
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:56.570
states we started this video with had been reduced to just five in the south

282
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:01.450
though a Bavaria Bhajan voting bug and Hess,
Saddam Stotts,
and an auth Bismark's,

283
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.150
new Prussian dominated north German superstate straddled the Baltic Sea.

284
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.690
All that was needed now with some pretext to forgetting the southern states on

285
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:12.290
board with this new thing called Germany.
Luckily there's mark.

286
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.540
He had plans for one final war

287
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:22.801
for the most in Europe.

288
00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:26.790
The creation of the north German confederation was greeted with enthusiasm for

289
00:16:26.791 --> 00:16:28.360
liberals and German nationalists.

290
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.250
It was the moments that had been waiting for since 1848 and for the major
powers,

291
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:35.490
it was a useful corrective to the void left by the holy Roman Empire as

292
00:16:35.491 --> 00:16:39.630
destruction.
But there was one man who was very displeased with the way things,

293
00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:42.780
but going in Paris,
Napoleon the third,
he stewed in business,

294
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.300
having given Bismarck his blessing to go to war with Austria.

295
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.230
The French emperor had been expecting something in return and made moves to

296
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.890
annex Luxembourg for France,
but Bismarck stopped him worse.

297
00:16:52.891 --> 00:16:56.070
He threatened to go to war over Luxembourg's neutrality.

298
00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.000
Suddenly France was looking like the week European power against this booming

299
00:17:00.001 --> 00:17:01.170
new nation of Germany.

300
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.340
So on a succession crisis blew up Spain in 1870 and pressure trying to step in.

301
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.760
Napoleon the third decided to assert his empire.
As you'll know,

302
00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.460
if you watched our video on the polio and the thirds and trust us,

303
00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:15.370
these do videos do really compliment each other wrong.
But well,
Paris dispatch,

304
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:17.220
the French ambassador to m's,

305
00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:20.340
where he had calls today vacation in Kaiser Wilhelm the fest,

306
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:25.350
the two passions and arguments,
and then was that only,
it wasn't quite.

307
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.860
See Bismarck somehow got ahold of a memo about that arguments by now,

308
00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:33.380
a master of the dark arts of politics.
See the editors,
what had been said.

309
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.070
So it appeared that French honor had been unforgivably insulted,

310
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:38.660
known as the EMS dispatch.

311
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.040
Bismark's edited memo did its job perfectly when Bismarck leaked it's contents

312
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:43.760
to the press.

313
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.380
The French public was so outraged that Napoleon the third declared war for the

314
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:49.201
previous three years,

315
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:52.230
but as mark had been trying to control the southern dramatic states since

316
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.230
joining his new confederation,
but without any success,

317
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.800
but with the French suddenly preparing to invade Prussia through those southern

318
00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:01.860
states,
the holdout German real,
as they changed their tune,

319
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.250
terrifying of a dollar store.
Napoleon rampaging through their backyards,

320
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.260
Bavaria and the rest fled into Bismark's embrace.
Bismarck made it simple.

321
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.020
His army would protect them from the French on one condition.

322
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.560
They join his new Jimin Empire.
Once he had his agreements,

323
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:18.780
Bismarck set out to crush the French,

324
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.990
the French are gone toward expecting the other European powers to join them.

325
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.000
That Australia was now on good terms with pressure,
raven,

326
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.880
that whole not invading Vienna thing.
Well,

327
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.200
the Italians loved Prussia for giving Austria a kicking president and Russia

328
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.900
Ninewells simply didn't care about a squabble between Paris and Berlin.

329
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.720
So when the thread band wrench,
army,

330
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.830
finally a tag to the well-trained Prussian one on August the fourth 1870 it

331
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.220
wasn't even a route.
It was a massacre.
Over the next month,

332
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.130
the Prussians humiliated the French first day scattered their army,

333
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:50.400
then they invaded France.
Then they laid siege to Paris.

334
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.700
Finally on September the second 18 17th the Prussians surrounds it and capture

335
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:58.020
it.
Napoleon the third,
it was the death blow for the second friend Shantha.

336
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.900
It was also the bath of the German one.

337
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.850
On January the 18th 1871 Bismarck and Ville home traveled to Louis the 14th old

338
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:09.270
palace of Versailles to declare the creation of the German empire.

339
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.390
It was touch and go.
At the last moment,

340
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.790
Ville home decided he didn't want to be emperor but rather to be king and it was

341
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:18.240
only after another multi hour screaming match that there's Mark Convinced Ville

342
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:20.250
home that if you don't do this now,
Dum,
Dum.

343
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.490
Everything we've been working for him in the last decade will be lost.

344
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.400
Finally though,
the empire,
it was declared beneath a ceiling.

345
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.700
Fresco of Louis the 14th invading the holy Roman Empire.

346
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.840
French representatives surrendered the territory of Alsace Lorraine to Germany

347
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.790
and degree to pay an indemnity of 5 billion.
Frank's not 20 kilometers away.

348
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.640
Prussian bombs continued to fall on the citizens of Paris,

349
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.520
leaving them shell shocked and more ways than one.

350
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.690
Almost a quarter of a century after the liberal revolutionaries of 1848 says

351
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.580
fails to do so with speeches.

352
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.110
There's mark had finally created Germany with blood and with iron.

353
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.960
It was the dawning of a brave new world and Europe,

354
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.760
but it would never be the same again

355
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.430
if the 1860s what?
Bismark's decade of war,

356
00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:13.810
the 1870s and eighties eighties whereas decades of peace with France scribbled

357
00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:16.760
and Germany suddenly a thing the other powers sat at the table,

358
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.330
we'll started exchanging uneasy looks with one another.

359
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.740
I'm wondering if this new beer swilling nation was going to start something,

360
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.080
but they needn't have worried.
Unlike Kaiser Wilhelm,

361
00:20:26.081 --> 00:20:28.180
the second or Hitler or Napoleon,

362
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.810
there's Marco is the conqueror who believed in restraint with Franco Prussian

363
00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:33.880
war rover.
He halted and expansion.

364
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.340
He turned his attention to and tunnel security.

365
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.330
While future generations would assume Germany's existence with master of
destiny.

366
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.620
This is,
mark knew how fragile his new empire was.
Instead of fighting.

367
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.740
Now is the time for ruling as dual minister,

368
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:50.050
president of pressure and Chancellor of the new Germany.

369
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.310
This is mark rules with a strange combination of enlightenment and repression.

370
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.790
Only enlightened society introduced universal male suffrage,

371
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.150
the established a national healthcare system.
He introduced accidents,

372
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:04.960
insurance and it's brought in old age pensions.
This was Europe's very fast,

373
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:09.070
modern welfare states and it was complemented by enlightened acts on the world

374
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:12.130
stage.
In 1985 Bismarck house did a great power conference,

375
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:14.200
this and did the scramble for Africa,
you'll say,

376
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:17.410
devoted himself to European piece,
going out of his way to accommodate Russia,

377
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.870
England,
Austria,
Italy,
and even France.

378
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.280
But behinds this enlightened statesmen lay a guy who just couldn't stop himself

379
00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:29.170
from occasionally acting like a petulant dictator in the early 1870s for
example,

380
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:33.040
Bismarck launched a policy known as cool to accomp dressed up as these things

381
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.890
usually are as a way of preserving a native culture.

382
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.940
It was really just an excuse to crack down on gem and Catholics and tries to

383
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:42.310
turn them into good Prussian style protestants.

384
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.970
This was followed in turn by a crackdown on Socialists and social democrats

385
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.550
since basically anyone to the left of Bismark,

386
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:53.551
which was basically everyone under 50 Bismarck was terrified of exiting and is

387
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.940
in revolution,

388
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.930
so he assumed cracking down on the forces he feared would keep him in office for

389
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:01.130
Rafa,
but while Bismarck was never overthrown,

390
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.430
he couldn't keep us enemies out of government either.

391
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.210
On the election of 1890 rolled around two decades of anti Catholic antisocial,

392
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:11.860
there's policies resulted in a landslide for the anti Bismarck forces.
However,

393
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.920
it was 1888 rather than 1890 this proved to be this on doing in German history.

394
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:20.680
1888 is known as the year of the three emperors.

395
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.750
That's because on March the ninth the fill home,

396
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:25.510
the first passed away and Frederick the thud became emperor.

397
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.590
Bismarck has known for years that Phil home was on the way out and it spends all

398
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:32.440
that time grooming Frederick just as a done Frederick's father.

399
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.660
Unfortunately for this marks well laid plans.

400
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.120
Frederick the third last just 99 days in office,

401
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.110
the followup dying himself in his way.

402
00:22:39.111 --> 00:22:40.990
He can other man rose to the imperial throne,

403
00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:44.980
a man who would go down in history for all the wrong reasons and that's

404
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:48.220
Kaysville home.
The seconds Ville homeless.
Second was everything.

405
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.470
Bismarck couldn't stand.
He was impulsive,
sulky,

406
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.360
prone to absurd decisions and most importantly utterly unwilling to listen to a

407
00:22:55.361 --> 00:23:00.130
stuffy old winds bag who'd served his grandfather and great grandfather belly

408
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.250
had to drill home.
The seconds.
Backside warms the imperial throne.

409
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.400
Then he publicly dismissed Bismarck in 1890 the on John resigned to his oldest

410
00:23:08.431 --> 00:23:11.920
date and a half expecting the governments do recall him the any moment,

411
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.290
but they never did.
All three lived eight more years.

412
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:17.320
Bismarck would never be in a position of power again

413
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:27.850
if Bismark's life had been the great raw of an iron ox is retirement was the

414
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.630
better thing of who we did bowl until his death is mock wrote books and

415
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.990
pamphlets and made long speeches.
Lionizing himself.
Well,

416
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.220
tarring Ville helm the sack and government has a bunch.
I think competent boobs,

417
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.920
well,
this well is doubtless chairing to his supporters.

418
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.580
It blades and unfortunate precedent Bismark's self mythologizing rent cemented

419
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:50.690
the image of Bismarck for blacksmith who single handedly forged Germany's

420
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:51.380
destiny.

421
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.280
It was an idea that hung around in German politics into the mid 20th century

422
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.870
influencing another self proclaimed man of destiny.
Adolf Hitler.

423
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.250
Unfortunate too was the way Bismarck simply Ranzit rather than taught in his

424
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:08.030
life.
It created a complex system of alliances and friendships to ensure no other

425
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:09.590
power tried to attack Germany,

426
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.730
but the system was so complex that no one else could really grasp it and so his

427
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:14.390
departure,

428
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.290
it's marked at the beginning of the slippery slope towards World War One.

429
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.240
Finally,
on July the 30th 1898 is mark passed away and his last moments,

430
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:26.810
he expressed regret that he hadn't been kind to his dog Selten before saying

431
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:31.340
that it soon z,
his wife Joanne,
or again,
he was 83 from our perspective,

432
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.890
it's impossible to overstate how important Bismarck was.

433
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.760
He managed to take a group of disparate European states and transform them into

434
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:39.290
a single United hole.

435
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.650
It's telling that even in the wake of World War One and world war two,

436
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.800
no one ever seriously considered breaking Germany up again.

437
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.940
Even the creation of communist East Germany ended with the two Germany's

438
00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:54.380
reuniting in 1990 modern Germany,
maybe smaller than it was in Bismark's Day,

439
00:24:54.381 --> 00:24:57.920
but its continued existence is now a geopolitical given.

440
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.800
Can we imagine a world without Bismarck?
Secondly,

441
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.610
it would look very different from all.
Well today Berlin would be a backwater.

442
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.740
The European Union likely wouldn't exist and Germany would just be a crazy dream

443
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:14.090
some way would liberals had ones that can 1848 on the other hand,

444
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.030
we'd have no world war one and World War Two,
no Hitler,

445
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:21.840
no Goebbels final solution.
Would it be a better world?
Well,
this fall removed.
