1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.660
The magnanimous offer with all the kings and his military force of Britain

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
fought against the Saxons and as though there were many more noble than himself,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.780
yet he was 12 times chosen their commander and was as often conqueror.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.590
This is a quote from the ancient text known as Historia Britain on,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.110
which was one of the oldest records of king office life story.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
We've all grown up watching movies and reading books about the legend of King

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.630
Arthur Young man poles.
The Magic Sword.

8
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:29.490
Excalibur from the stone and a wizard named Merlin guides him into manhood as an

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.030
adult's.

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.260
He established the legendary knights of the round table and ruled over Camelot.

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.220
Future generations would look to him as the first king of the British empire.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.410
However,
well everyone knows him by name.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.000
Few people know the whole story behind the man who became the legends.

14
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.200
Harold biographics.

15
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
Today we aim to uncover the truth behind King Arthur of Camelot.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.090
<v 1>Yeah,
okay.</v>

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.500
<v 0>During the fifth century,
the Modern Day United Kingdom was called Britannia.</v>

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.040
The Roman conquer has had been driven out of the lambs and the ancient Britons.

19
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.100
They were left to govern themselves without a central government,
the country,

20
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.460
it was plunged into a time known as the dark ages.

21
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.610
Several Celtic tribal leaders declared themselves the king,

22
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.340
but there was never one ruler who governed them all.

23
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.380
If this reminds you a little bit of game of Thrones,

24
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:29.090
that's because George Rr Martin got a lot of his inspiration from these ancient

25
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:33.290
stories of early Middle Age war and conquest.
As you might imagine,

26
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.210
many of these kingdoms within the British isles,

27
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:38.450
they were at war with one another and this made it impossible for anyone to

28
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:41.450
settle down and establish any new art or culture.

29
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.960
There's a lot of mystery surrounding that time because very few people were

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.050
bothering to keep a historic record of daily life.

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.400
Almost everyone was illiterate from the peasants all the way up to the nobility.

32
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.120
Christian clergyman.
We're the only ones who knew how to read and write,

33
00:01:56.121 --> 00:02:00.230
but they often isolated themselves from the rest of society in favor of devoting

34
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:03.110
their lives to theological study.
Without a central economy,

35
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.820
citizens and Britannia did not have money in the form of coins or bill.

36
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.510
So rather people were using a barter system to trade goods and services.

37
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.080
Most peasants were farmers and they grew enough food to feed themselves,

38
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:17.060
but even within this barter system,

39
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:21.170
people were still expected to pay taxes to their feudal lords in the form of

40
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:25.640
goods and labor.
Oftentimes,
if two kings were fighting over control of the land,

41
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.030
peasants had to pay taxes twice in one year.
Also,

42
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:32.390
without a proper education system,
people believed in magic as well.

43
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.960
Incredibly superstitious.
While Christianity existed,

44
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.590
many were still practicing the ancient pagan traditions.

45
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.270
It was during this unstable time when Arthur was born without any written

46
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.250
records.
We don't know the exact date of his birth,

47
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:49.130
but we do know that he was conceived in tins of gala,

48
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.470
which is on the coast of Cornwall in 2016 and archeological dig at tentacle

49
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.250
reveals that the city held many of the lavish luxury imported goods along the

50
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:59.680
coast of Cornwall.
At the time,

51
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.660
it would have been a town bustling with activity as boats sailed in and out of

52
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.330
the harbor.
All of his father was a man named king with a pen dragon.
Hey,

53
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.850
let's do the after a beautiful woman named Lady Egg rain,

54
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.460
but she was married to his rival,
Lord gold up according to legends,

55
00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:17.020
Penn Dragon osteous inhouse wizard,
Merlin D'acosta Costa magic spell.

56
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.640
He wants it to look like gold law so that he could trick a grain into having sex

57
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.720
with him.
Of course,

58
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:25.430
modern historians believe that Mellon was not a wizard at all.

59
00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:28.020
There's actually one of the last remaining Celtic true.

60
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:32.200
It's how the time druids were thought to have magical powers and a connection to

61
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.490
the spiritual world.

62
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.930
The druids lived their lives being one with nature and practicing herbal

63
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:39.910
medicine.
They weren't known to be incredibly.

64
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.760
Why isn't what some of the most intelligent people of the time,

65
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.420
Kevin Penn Dragon waited until Lord God while left on a business trip and then

66
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:49.210
he appeared before lady a grain disguised as a husband.

67
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.310
Considering that we know the magic isn't real,

68
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:54.910
we know that Mellon could not have cast a spell to focus appearance.

69
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.620
It is far more likely that if a pen dragon took a herbal potion from Merlin in

70
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:02.080
order to help him violator later.

71
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.490
Lord called while I was horrified to learn that his wife had been raped by an in

72
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.680
pasta shell.
Mutli became pregnant with Penn dragons baby.

73
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.540
This illegitimate child was the boy known as Alpha Lady Green did not want to

74
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:16.300
raise the baby and no one wanted to claim responsibility.

75
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.170
Marlin felt incredibly guilty for his part in all of this and knew that the boy

76
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.890
was actually a prince.
He took pity on Arthur Rhodes,

77
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.310
chose to raise him as his own son.
Lord God,

78
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.110
Ahrens lady agreeing would go on to have their own daughter and that would be

79
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.700
office half sister Morgan.

80
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.290
The druids were not the only ones who were thought to be magical.

81
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.750
In most cultures around the world,
women who lived alone,

82
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:44.910
we're often accused of practicing witchcraft.

83
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.240
A young woman named Vivian was known as the Lady of the lake,

84
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.100
but instead of being a frightening older,

85
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.790
which she was described as a beautiful fairy who lived under water.

86
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.800
Now we know that she wasn't a ferry of course,

87
00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:59.670
and that she was just a woman living alone in a cottage near a lake for years.

88
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.201
The lands.

89
00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:03.960
They were filled with watery lakes and Marsha's Christian clergyman belt,

90
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.640
their monasteries on small islands.

91
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.170
And the only way that people could travel there was by boat or by walking along

92
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.110
causeway is that were built over the water in the 17 hundreds.

93
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:16.200
This land was drained of water to utilize the farm lens.

94
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.680
But it wasn't until recently that modern archaeological digs uncovered a huge

95
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:22.760
amount of INH swords,
axes,
shields,
um,
uh,

96
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.110
and tools that had been thrown into the water.

97
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.550
Ancient Britons had a tradition of making an offering to the lord of the lands

98
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.040
by tossing their weapons into the lakes.
And Marsha,

99
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:33.360
it's because of our reputation as a magical fairy.

100
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:36.750
Vivian's lake was also a spot where people would throw their swords and weapons

101
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.820
in exchange for her blessing.
One day,

102
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.750
Vian discovered that someone had left a very different kind of offering on her

103
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:46.620
doorstep.
It was a newborn baby boy who had been abandoned by his mother.

104
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.490
She decided to raise the orphan child is a Ronan's named him lance laws.

105
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.240
Merlin was wise enough to know that the lady of the lake wasn't a farrier tall

106
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.350
and it was entranced by it Vivian's beauty and strength.

107
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.290
He fell in love with her and pleaded for her to give him a chance.

108
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.530
Vivian said that she would consider Merlin's proposal if he taught her

109
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.530
everything he knew in the more mystical versions of the story.

110
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.660
Merlin toward Vivian,
how's practice magic,

111
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.960
but you know it's more likely that he was actually showing her how to become a

112
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.340
drew it.
In the end,
they say that the lady of the lake traps melon forever.

113
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.520
Of course,
we know that if she's trapped anything,
it was his heart.

114
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.340
They fell in love and live together in that cottage on the lake.

115
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.670
Since Vivian was raising Lance Larson,
Merlin adopted Arthur,

116
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.070
the two boys would have grown up together as brothers.

117
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.520
You have all heard the epic tale of how young Arthur was able to pull the sword

118
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:40.790
Excalibur out of the stone and people drop to their knees.

119
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.540
This ended all of their ongoing battles in order to recognize him as that one

120
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.280
true king.
Unfortunately,

121
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.550
we now know that this version of the story is total fantasy,

122
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.450
the warring kingdoms.

123
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.120
They continued to fight one another for control of the Lens.

124
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.820
During Arthur's youth Lonza lots and Arthur,

125
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.100
they practice dueling one another from an early age.

126
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.670
Arthur sword was called many names including Caliban and Excalibur.

127
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.870
Other versions of the story leave out the stone completely and say that the lady

128
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.950
of the lake gave Excalibur to off that according to a researcher from the

129
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.820
University of Wales,
Rachel Bromage,

130
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.930
the name Excalibur may have similarly arisen at a very early date as a generic

131
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:16.040
name for a sought.

132
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.220
After all there they hadn't had an endless supply of weapons that were thrown

133
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:22.460
into our lake.
Since everyone bartered for suppliers during the dark ages,

134
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:25.550
it would only make sense that Vivian would dive into the lake to retrieve as

135
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.510
many valuable weapons as she could offer and monster lost have the rare luxury

136
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.480
of practicing with these expensive swords from an early age and they were

137
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.950
already skilled fighters years before they became nights when she was a
teenager.

138
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:40.070
I bath his half.
Sister Morgan wanted to become a druid as well,

139
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.020
so she began to study under Merlin,

140
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.530
she and the nickname Morgan la fe or Morgan ferry.

141
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.340
But this time author had no idea that Morgan was actually his half sister,

142
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.770
the two teenagers,
they fell deeply in love.

143
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.230
Merlin forbid the two of them for being together,
of course,

144
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:57.020
but he never revealed the secrets that they were actually siblings,

145
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.740
but just like any rebellious teenagers in love of trying to give them a pot,

146
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.890
only made their passion grow stronger.

147
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.980
Merlin realized that he needed to reveal the truth before it was too late.

148
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.680
By the time he was in his late teens,

149
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:17.440
after became one of the most skilled warriors in the land,

150
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:19.810
and you gained a massive amount of respect from other nights,

151
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.680
King Pan Dragon and his wife,
they never had another male heir to the throne.

152
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.450
Merlin at finally revealed the truth to offer that he was actually the prince

153
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:30.460
and the true success into the crown,
but this family drama,

154
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.300
it had to be put on the backburner because the Saxons began to invade Britannia,

155
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.830
the Saxons,
the ancient German people,

156
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:40.210
and they couldn't help but notice all of the chaos going on over in England.

157
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.010
They thought that because of the Roman empire was gone,

158
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:45.850
maybe this was their chance to take over the land for themselves according to a

159
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:48.760
ninth century riser us.
Then in those days,

160
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.970
Arthur fought against the Saxons with the king of the Britons,

161
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.610
but he was commander in those battles.

162
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.300
None of goes on until it's 12 different battles across all of Britannia wow.

163
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.110
After it was sent to a fought and conquered the invaders,

164
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.980
this would have taken years of dedication moving from place to place until all

165
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:08.730
of the Saxons were driven out of the British isles.
Soon enough off his name.

166
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.640
It's spread across the lands.
After gaining a loyal fan base,

167
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.210
Arthur revealed that he was the illegitimate son of King Pen Dragon.

168
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.410
The people of all these Celtic Kingdoms chose to bend the knee to author rents.

169
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.530
He was crowned as the once and future king

170
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.860
off,
built his own castle and Camelot's,

171
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:34.370
which is said to be located in modern day whales,
often becoming king.

172
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.540
Everyone now knew who authors parents were and he could never marry his half

173
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:42.680
sister Morgan,
so he therefore married a woman called lady Gwen of Aaron stead.

174
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.060
She became his queen.

175
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.600
It is said that she was one of the most beautiful women in the lands,

176
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:50.930
but it's like many royal marriages.
There's was one of duty rather than love.

177
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.070
Morgan got married to a man called King,
lot of Orkney reader of Norway,

178
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.600
so she became queen and went on to have a son named going just by the fact that

179
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:02.240
they now knew they were siblings often are and Morgan were still in love with

180
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:02.750
one another.

181
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.590
They could not contain their passion and continued this forbidden romance behind

182
00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:10.190
closed doors.
She became pregnant and gave birth to their son.
Moderate.

183
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.670
Once loss had fought alongside Arthur during the war and he was celebrated as

184
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.770
being one of the most skilled nights in the land.

185
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.880
He continued to stay by off the side as a Lord in office course and married a

186
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:23.390
beautiful young woman named Lady Elaine Lancelot were to participate and

187
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.230
jousting tournament and became an undefeated champion Queen Gwynna via.

188
00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:30.180
I could sense that King Arthur was not loyal to her,

189
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:33.860
so she enlarged slots began having a secret love affair together during his

190
00:10:33.861 --> 00:10:37.010
battles against the Saxons often gathered his nights that he knew he could
trust.

191
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.830
He built a large round table in the Great Hall of his castle.

192
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.700
He chose this circular shape so that no man would be in a seat that was more

193
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.920
important than the others.

194
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.980
Dozens of men would gather to discuss politics and plan for future quests.

195
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.010
Arthur and his knights,
they went on countless adventures together.

196
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.920
One of the most famous quests was the search for the holy grail,

197
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:58.250
which was said to have been the comp that Jesus Christ drank from during the

198
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:01.730
last south hub,
according to the 12th century writer shredding on Detroit.

199
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.910
That grail was made of the finest pure gold,

200
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.950
and it was such a precious stones of many kinds of the richest and most precious

201
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:15.130
in the earth or the sea legend has it that wondering from this cop would heal

202
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:18.620
all wounds and guarantee that it's owner would be granted eternal life.

203
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.310
Many historians believe that the legend of the holy grail was simply putting a

204
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:25.820
Christine twist on the Pagan myth of the cauldrons of plenty.

205
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:29.330
But that did not stop these men from attempting to find this mythical item.

206
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.620
Lancelot and Lady Elaine,

207
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:34.250
they went on to have a son named Galahad who was said to have one of the purest

208
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:37.100
hearts of all the nights in Britannia.
As the story goes,

209
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:41.030
Galahad was the only night we had a true enough heart to touch the grail,

210
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:42.920
but he died attempting to find it.

211
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.800
Most scholars believe that the Holy Grail is just a myth,

212
00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:50.120
while others say that it is a real artifact waiting to be discovered.
So anyway,

213
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:52.970
Morgan,
the fake found out about Lancelot and Gwen avails love,

214
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.380
and she revealed the truth to offer just by the fact that everyone was chasing.

215
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.850
I want another this revelation,

216
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:02.110
it's still outraged off and he felt completely betrayed by his best friends.

217
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.460
Authors nights they stormed lance lots,
chamber runs,
he was tortured and killed.

218
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.110
Queen [inaudible] was allowed to live,

219
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:11.920
but she had to witness her true love die as a result of the affair

220
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:23.130
off his son and also nephew more knew from an early age that he was a child of

221
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:23.770
incest,

222
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.920
but he would never be able to reveal the truth to the public that he was the

223
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:29.690
true out of the throne.
When he grew up,
more was knighted,

224
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.550
but he had to pretend to be only his father's nephew.
His older brother go,

225
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:35.290
Wayne ascended to the throne of Norway,

226
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.770
but it was also very loyal member of King Arthur's round table.

227
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.690
Like many roles here with a product of incest.

228
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:43.780
Mordrid was known for being a little bit more than crazy.

229
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.090
He has an incredibly violent temper during battle Queen Greenwich.

230
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.480
Erin [inaudible] never had any children together,

231
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:52.990
so there was never an outage and the throne of Camelot moderate grub hating his

232
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:56.890
father and he came up with a plan for how to take the throne for himself.

233
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.320
Heartbroken over the loss of her beloved Lancelot.

234
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.640
Queen Gwenivere spent most of her days alone in the castle.
One day,

235
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.230
King Arthur was away on one of his many quests.

236
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.370
Mordrid saw this is an opportunity to seduce Gwen of and it worked.

237
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.530
The queen saw this is a second chance at happiness,

238
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:16.000
so she ran off to marry this young man who she thought was her husband's nephew

239
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.080
in this case,
so we could say,

240
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:19.600
is it good that they're at least not blood relatives?
Anyway,

241
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.710
in his father's absence,

242
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:24.610
moderate sat on authors thrown and declared to everyone in the kingdom that he

243
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:26.290
was now the new king of Camelot.

244
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.290
When the return time he saw more dreaded taking the throne.

245
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.920
This betrayal is what sparks in the battle of Kamlan were father and son,

246
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.770
fourth one another in the battlefield.
They were both mortally wounded,

247
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.690
killing one of that that went off the Diet.

248
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:40.390
His body was taken to an island called Avalon to be buried.

249
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.110
Now,
just before we get into the legacy,
I do want to point out,

250
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:52.080
but the day this video went live is indeed April.

251
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:56.880
The first of 2019 hang off was not a real person.

252
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.950
Okay.
April fool's day,
we,
sorry to say,

253
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.090
but the character of King Arthur was a complete work of fiction and so was this

254
00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:06.280
entire video.
The legends we now know today came from a British,

255
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:08.610
your story and called Geoffrey of Monmouth,

256
00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:12.960
who write the 11th century book called the history of the kings of Britain.

257
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.390
According to archaeologists,
Dr. Miles Russell,

258
00:14:15.391 --> 00:14:19.380
the legend of King Arthur is really based on five different individual leaders

259
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.490
in the ancient world.

260
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.820
The first was called Embracia saw early on us and he was actually one of the

261
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.740
people who defeated the Saxons and battle.

262
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.520
There are also elements of the true stories of Rehmann rulers like Constantine,

263
00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:33.990
the great ans magnus maximus.
Dr. Russell says,
Arthur's Beth marriage,

264
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.550
midlife crisis,
and dramatic death.
These are elements that have already happened.

265
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.150
When you take them away from Arthur's story,
there is nothing there for Arthur.

266
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.540
The character Jeffery gives us is an echo of other people.

267
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.600
I suspect he's trying to create a Celtic Superhero.

268
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.740
The legend of King Arthur became even more elaborate during the century when a

269
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:55.670
French poet named Detroit out is all of that romantic elements to the story.

270
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.180
He is the one I did the details about Milan and the lady in the lake and the

271
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:01.320
romance between lady going Advair and Lancelot.

272
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.970
Despite the fact that these texts were not historically accurate as the fact

273
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:09.290
that they contains half truths and how fictions was enough to confuse future

274
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.070
generations.

275
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.370
Kings and Queens in Briston spent over a thousand years believing that King

276
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.210
Arthur was real.

277
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.590
They saw this as the original establishment of the British and bought even King

278
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:22.760
Henry the seventh named his first born son Prince offer and Declan's that he

279
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:26.000
would bring on a new authority and age these sides to balance,

280
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:30.890
to legitimize the legends,
to glad that the stories were true historic facts,

281
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.490
even commissioned arounds able to be built in his own castle so that he could

282
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:36.230
live like the legendary king.

283
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.030
The physician on liking effect continued well into the 1800 sweat Queen Victoria

284
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:41.421
commissions,

285
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:45.770
an entire wall of the raving room of the parliament building to show the story

286
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:49.730
of King off his life and his rise to power even well into the 20th century.

287
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.930
The Nazis believed that they needed to avenge the Saxon ancestors and the Nazis

288
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:58.340
to let society set house on their own quest for the holy grail in the 1930s it

289
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:02.090
wasn't until very recently that archeologists and historians of questions,

290
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.810
the existence of King Athens have chosen to write off the story.

291
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.860
It's just a legend,

292
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.960
despite the fact that it's a work of pure fiction hitting off the,

293
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.490
continues to capture the imagination of people around the welds and will

294
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.740
continue to do so for years to come.

295
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.210
So that lets us know in the comments section,

296
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:20.930
if you were fooled by this video or if you just a bit too clever to fall for it.

297
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.790
Maybe if you're watching this on April fool's day,

298
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:26.570
it could be a good thing to send to friends or family.
And as always,

299
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.860
thank you for watching.
