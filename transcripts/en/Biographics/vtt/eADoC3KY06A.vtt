1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
At the age of nine,

2
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.270
he knew what he wanted to do with his life and he never wavered from that goal.

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.940
Now he's one of the world's most famous scientists.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.480
He's earns the title of most powerful nerd in the universe from national public

5
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:15.860
radio and the title of the world's sexiest astro physicist from people magazine.

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.490
He was also instrumental in cutting down the number of planets in our solar

7
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.480
system and in doing so he upsets and entire generation who would come to love

8
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:23.901
Pluto.

9
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:28.880
Who as the small crikey planet and as well who is this icon of science that's

10
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.710
recognizable by the general populous?
Well,
of course it's Neil degrasse Tyson.

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.090
<v 0>Dyson was born in New York City in 1959 and he grew up in the Bronx.</v>

13
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.190
His mother worked for the U S Department of Health,

14
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:59.200
education and welfare and his father worked for the city of New York,
Tyson.

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.120
He was a star student at the Bronx High School of Science.

16
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.490
Well before beginning at the Bronx High School of Science,

17
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.420
they'd Tyson had decided that science was the path that he wants to follow with

18
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.490
his life.
When he was an elementary school.

19
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.700
So essence class took a field trip to the Hayden Planetarium.

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.620
While that he felt that he was literally calls to a career in science,

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.610
so strong was that in brands of the night sky that I'm certain that I had no

22
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:27.050
choice in the matter that in fact the university called me twice and immediately

23
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:30.920
began committing time to his new found interest and some might say obsession and

24
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.730
his time in high school showed his dedication to the study of the stars while

25
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:37.700
attending the Bronx High School of Science.
Tyson was a wrestler,

26
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.980
but he devoted much time to his studies.

27
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.430
He was the editor of the physical science journal Man's regular classes.

28
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:44.330
They weren't enough for him.

29
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.570
He actually took classes at the very place that sparked his interest in

30
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
astrophysics,
the Hayden Planetarium afterschool.

31
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.760
He spent time observing the sky and the moon,

32
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.760
the stars all from the roof of his home in New York.

33
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.260
His dedication to science and academics during his teenage years grabbed the

34
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.800
attention of some very prominent people.
One of these,
well,

35
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.690
you might've heard of him as Carl Sagan.

36
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.670
When it came time for Tyson to apply to college,
Cornell,

37
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.520
it was among the schools that he applied to.

38
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.150
The Sagan was a professor at Cornell and the admissions office made sure he was

39
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:18.350
sent a copy of Tyson's application after they saw the talent and potential that

40
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:20.210
was within this aspiring scientist.

41
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.600
Sagan was duly impressed by what Tyson had written in his application.

42
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.960
So much so that he invited Tyson.
Just spend a day at Cornell to Iceland.

43
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.360
He remembers that day in 1975 it's one of the most formative days of his life.

44
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.800
Sagan,
well,
he died in 1996 and Tyson came into possession of his dates work,

45
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.810
which includes the notation Neil Tyson on the square for December the 20th 1975

46
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.040
the two science minded men spend the day together touring Cornell's labs and

47
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:49.970
discussing the mysteries of the universe so you can gifted Tyson with a copy of

48
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.140
the book,
the cosmic connection inscribing.

49
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.900
It's to indicate his prediction and hope for Tyson's career to a future

50
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.060
astronomer.
Tyson never forgot.

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.380
He learns from Seguin that day and the lessons he took back to the Bronx.

52
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.750
With him,
we're more than just the scientific method.

53
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.240
I already knew I wanted to become a scientist,

54
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.020
but that afternoon I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become.

55
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.640
He reached out to me and to countless others,
inspiring.
So many of us just study,

56
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.050
teach,
and do science.

57
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.800
Science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations.

58
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.420
A few months after his visit,

59
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.660
Cornell Tyson and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science,

60
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.870
even though his visit with sake and had a profound impact on his life,

61
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.600
Tyson opted not to attend Cornell,
but as an excellent students.

62
00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:35.140
He had no shortage of prominence goals to choose from.

63
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.210
Though Cornell wasn't the right fit for him.

64
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.800
Harvard was Tyson entered Harvard as an undergraduate in the fall of 1976 as a

65
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:45.010
student.
He paid his tuition partially through grants and scholarships,

66
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.350
but also through a work study program.

67
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.800
Part of Tyson's work requirements was to clean bathrooms on campus,

68
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.610
including those of the other students on eight Neri King live appearance.

69
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.840
He described the experiences a little weird that he was willing to do it to pay

70
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:02.860
his way through school and to achieve his dreams working and study in physics

71
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.670
when enough to occupy the active and curious Tyson though he was on the crew

72
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:10.480
team and the wrestling team while he was at Harvard and he was also a jazz

73
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.040
ballet and Latin dancer.

74
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.270
He graduated from Harvard in 1980 with a degree in physics and kept his academic

75
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:19.900
career moving forward with an acceptance to the University of Texas for a

76
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:20.860
masters program.

77
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.900
He completed his MBA in astronomy in 1983 and he intended to pursue a doctorate

78
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:27.580
from the college,
but well,

79
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.660
here's a roadblock and Tyson himself admits that the roadblock with largely of

80
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.370
his own making looking bag,

81
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.000
he has admitted that he didn't devote as much time to doing lab research during

82
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.450
his graduate years as he should have and could have and this prevented him from

83
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.290
being able to go right from his master's program to earning a doctoral degree.

84
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.980
He even had professors tell him to stop working in the field of astronomy.

85
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.680
At one point struggling as a student and it's broke.

86
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.070
Tyson considered a very different job than that of a professor.

87
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:58.180
Royal Museum director.
He thought about becoming an exotic dancer.

88
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.090
He even went so far for us to go to a show to see if he could do it.

89
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.510
When the dancers came out and their skimpy undergarments were lit up as they

90
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:08.530
join Rita do a rendition of great balls of fire to ice and decided that no

91
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.650
matter how broke he was exotic dancing.
Well,

92
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.350
it wasn't very am thankfully for the scientific community.

93
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.850
They Tyson's break from academics.

94
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.300
It was short lived with his undergraduate achievements and a start and a

95
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:20.134
graduate degree.

96
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.830
He was able to land a teaching job at the University of Maryland's and

97
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:27.880
eventually he found his way back onto the doctoral track in the Ivy League in

98
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:32.390
1991 15 years after scrubbing toilets to pay for his undergraduate degree to

99
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:36.850
Iceland,
graduated from Columbia University with a doctorate in astrophysics.

100
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.190
He then studied in the Ivy League system moving to Princeton for a postdoctoral

101
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.033
position

102
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.300
while he was earning his degrees and moving his way up the academic ladder.

103
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.290
Tyson was publishing articles and writing a column for date,

104
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.440
a Science magazine published by the University of Texas.

105
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.270
While he was attending Columbia,

106
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.530
he also worked under a professor who was supportive of Tyson's ambitions and

107
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.290
intellect,
applying for grants that gave Tyson access,

108
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.790
do the international astronomy community,
Tyson.

109
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.740
He traveled throughout Europe attending meetings and learning from the best and

110
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.730
brightest in the field from all around the world at Tyson's own star.

111
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.450
It was awesome getting to rise soon after graduating from Columbia.
Well,

112
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.460
he landed his dream job and yep,

113
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.720
that was a position back at the Hayden Planetarium.
Whereas dreams that started,

114
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.940
he started out as a staff scientist,

115
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.480
but it was after one year that he was named acting director of the planetarium.

116
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.640
Then only one more year later,

117
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.150
he was formerly named the director of the Hayden Planetarium.

118
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.220
Early on in his tenure in director,

119
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.290
he made updating and modernizing the facility,
a keystone of his work at Hazen,

120
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.250
the project.
It was a $200 million undertaking.
The gate of the public,

121
00:06:55.251 --> 00:07:00.251
a modernized invoicing look into the vastness of the universe and his work well.

122
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.870
That extended way beyond the planetarium.

123
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.280
In 2001 he received a presidential appointment to work on policies related to

124
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.280
the future of the u s space industry.
After that,

125
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.240
he was part of a commission to work on the future of space exploration is

126
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.960
serving on these committees was so impressive that NASA gave him the

127
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:21.380
distinguished public service medal,
Tyson's scientific work,

128
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:24.470
as well as decisions he made about the Hayden Planetarium puts him in the

129
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:26.780
spotlight for the general public well beyond those.

130
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.070
Normally in the scientific community.

131
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.090
He actually became a household name because of one particular decision and to

132
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:33.290
what?
What did he do?
Well,

133
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.280
he removed the planet of Pluto from the planetariums are solar system display

134
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.870
school from parents and scientists are like,
well,

135
00:07:39.871 --> 00:07:41.420
I'm not impressed with this decision,

136
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.920
and soon it became more about just the planetariums displayed please hose fate.

137
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.470
It was taken up by an international organization,

138
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.590
the International Astronomical Union in 2006 the organization made their stance

139
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:58.130
on Pluto official when they deemed Pluto a dwarf planet officially knocking our

140
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:01.140
solar system down to having only eight planets.
So well,

141
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.610
the question might be now,
well,
what does Tyson maintain is so wrong with Pluto?

142
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.240
Well,
for one,
it has the potential to grow a tail.
Yes,

143
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:11.870
that is a legitimate reason.
And hit is the man himself explaining us.

144
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.280
So Pluto is not the littlest planet or rice.
That's a loan.
It shouldn't it.

145
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.910
But more than half of its volume is ice.
No other planet has that.

146
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.850
So if you moved it to two where earth is right now,

147
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.970
heat from the sun would evaporate the ice and it would grow a tail.

148
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.440
That's no kind of behavior for a planet answered as Pluto's orbit is much more

149
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.260
elongated than that of the other planets.
And it's so small.

150
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.630
But the other planets have moons that are larger than Pluto.

151
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.500
And you're beginning to see why he falls on the Pluto is not a planet side of

152
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.780
the fence.
Now,
the police thing was one of the most famous,

153
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.410
maybe infamous scientific assertions of Tyson's career.
Indeed,

154
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.060
he has written articles,
essays,

155
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:51.110
and even books that discuss in much more detail the demotion of this planet,

156
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.891
how they spoke to us.

157
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:54.920
He wrote for National History magazine and the 1990s in his columns were later

158
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.370
into two different books.

159
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.730
These were at death by black hole and astrophysics for people in a hurry.

160
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.970
He chose the pen name of Merlin for himself when he wrote a column in the start,

161
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.840
a magazine and those columns,
they will also later published as books.

162
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.450
<v 0>Tyson hasn't just used publications do you spread the word about science and the</v>

164
00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:22.370
universe?
He's hosted TV shows.

165
00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:26.210
He regularly appears as a guest on other shows and he has his own podcast called

166
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.053
startalk.

167
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.040
He hosted at Nova Science now in the mid two thousands raising his profile even

168
00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:32.450
further to most Americans.

169
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.830
He was so popular as a host that in 2014 the where I brought him back to delve

170
00:09:36.831 --> 00:09:40.640
even further into science for the American people,
the 2014 to show,

171
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:44.570
gave Tyson and opportunity to build on the work of a man who had impacted him

172
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.410
early on.
And that would be Carl Sagan.
Well actually it was cosmos,

173
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.300
a new version of the popular on that Sagan.

174
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:54.860
It hosted in the 1980s at the time of its air and cosmos was the most watched

175
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.540
show in the United States.

176
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.900
But if there was anyone who could live up to these kinds of expectations,

177
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:01.100
well and that would be Tyson.

178
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.480
He didn't have to go to loan in 2014 though he had the help of sagans widow who

179
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:06.830
worked as a right of the cosmos.

180
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.610
And the two made sure to include illusions to sagans work throughout the rebuke

181
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.320
did series the series,

182
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.120
it was a success and over 3 million Americans put their TV on to Fox to catch

183
00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:22.121
the newest science lesson presented by Tyson every Sunday for 13 weeks because

184
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.590
of us.
Reboot was undoubtedly successful.

185
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.760
And showed Tyson's appeal to the general populace,
but his appeal in the media,

186
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.450
well,
it goes well beyond direct and serious science.

187
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.340
He's appeared as a guest on family guy,

188
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:37.550
Brooklyn nine nine and his character in new ice age.

189
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.320
The Big Bang theory with it's nerdy cast has of course welcomes Tyson as a
guest.

190
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.090
He even made an appearance on avenged sevenfold Zalman the stage he didn't sing

191
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:50.600
but instead delivered a monologue during one of the band's songs and musical at

192
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.840
Aaron's that was remits happened that never actually came about was that Tyson

193
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:57.690
would appear on an album with whoops hand clang member [inaudible] though the

194
00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:58.580
appearance never happens.

195
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.600
It does speak to Tyson's breadth of talents and popularity that many people

196
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:06.140
thought it was a very profitable thing for Tyson to do while the album didn't

197
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:09.740
happen.
Tyson hinges or did appear together,
which is a wrapped on startalk.

198
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.250
Even the daily show is regularly featured Tyson to comment on science matters

199
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.720
and as he did with Pluto,

200
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.040
Tyson makes no bones about sharing his thoughts on what needs to be corrected.

201
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.520
Indeed a blight on area informed John Stewart,
the beginning of your program,

202
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.100
the Earth is spinning the wrong direction.
I'm sorry,

203
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.360
I had to get that off my chest.
The Earth on the credits were spinning clockwise.

204
00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:31.640
When earth really spins counterclockwise,

205
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.910
though Tyson pointed it down to Stewart and the entire viewing audience.

206
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.320
It wasn't until Trevor Noah took over as host in 2015 that the show made a

207
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:42.140
permanent correction to the earth spinning direction.

208
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.980
Tyson was excited about the change in the tweet and artists,

209
00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:46.070
thanks to the daily show.

210
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.340
The daily show is globe isn't the only correction that Tyson's scientific

211
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:51.650
knowledge has led to in the realm of pop culture.

212
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.110
While you might remember that 97 blockbuster movie,
titanic,
well,

213
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.100
Tyson sore it anti wasn't impressed near the ends.
Off to the ship was sunk.

214
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.530
Rose's lying on a board in the freezing Atlantic Ocean.

215
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.060
She's gazing up at the night sky as the audience can see what she sees the stars

216
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.820
in the sky over the ocean.
When Tyson saw that scene,

217
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.060
he noticed something that the rest of us didn't.
While the styles,

218
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:16.330
they weren't in the road arrangement for the year in 1912 at the latitude and

219
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.420
longitude where the titanic sunk.
So as with the daily show,

220
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.140
Tyson lets director David Cameron know according to Cameron,

221
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.840
Tyson's and Timmy snarky email on the subject.

222
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.010
15 years after that film was first released Cameron and took Tyson suggestion

223
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:33.610
and adjusted the night's going in that scene in order to be accurate as titanic

224
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.320
in the daily show weren't enough for Tyson.

225
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:38.620
These even how to hands in keeping Superman's scientifically accurate.

226
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.730
DC comics wanted to feature the world's most famous astrophysicist and a comic

227
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.900
that's Tyson wouldn't do it unless he could be sure of the accuracy with the

228
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:47.291
distance.

229
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:50.740
Krypton is supposed to be from Earth at Tyson said he would never be able to

230
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:53.710
help.
Superman's spot it.
It's like,
well what did he do?
Well,

231
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.850
he did his research and found an actual red star to serve as crips on and

232
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.050
crafted a story whereby superman would combine all the telescopes on earth to be

233
00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:06.070
able to see Krypton.
So no media format has been untouched by Tyson.

234
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.090
The man is everywhere.
Spreading the word of science and the people of the world.

235
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.063
Well,
we're listening.

236
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.290
Creators and producers take his advice and seek him out for appearances among

237
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:18.340
scientists.
He is unique in this kind of stardom.

238
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.930
A serious scientist and pop culture figure would seem to make any person

239
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:32.920
interesting enough.

240
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:37.030
But Tyson has hobbies and interests that go well beyond the mysteries of space

241
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.990
and the sharing of science.
He and his wife Alice,
who he maps in a physics class,

242
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:44.410
I'll go foodies.
Tyson has said that they probably spend too much money on food,

243
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.730
but living in Manhattan,

244
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:49.270
they have so many restaurants to explore and so many food options to try out

245
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.120
that they take every opportunity they can to try new foods.
So Iceland,

246
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.490
he's also a wine connoisseur.

247
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.000
His love of science plays a big role in his enjoyment of wine helping him.

248
00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:01.690
Do you understand why different wine tastes different and how they best can be

249
00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:03.400
served like much else?

250
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.390
Tyson explains these concepts simply so that nonscientists can understand them

251
00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:11.410
to the lower than 32 degrees.
Freezing points of liquids that contain alcohol.

252
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.590
Like wine allows you to chill a bottle of white wine to sub freezing

253
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:17.740
temperatures without it freezing before you bring it to a dinner party.

254
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.310
The wine warms up during the travel time to just the right temperature in time

255
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:25.360
for dinner in dd rather well known scientist is the source of Tyson's favorite

256
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.990
quote about food and wine and that would be Galileo.
The Sun.

257
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:32.800
With all those planets revolving around it and dependent on it can still write

258
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:37.060
them a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else in the universe to do food,

259
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.080
wine,
physics.
Well,
what's left for him to care about and learn about?
Well,

260
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.920
calligraphy for one Tyson can create beautiful letter dart with a feathered pen,

261
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.590
but is especially passionate about fountain pens.

262
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.100
He loves them so much that his wife has spent a $6,000 to buy him.

263
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.470
A Japanese made Penn as a gift when you finalize the contracts on his

264
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:55.370
autobiography.

265
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.720
He even gave an entire interview to the New York Times on the pen and his love

266
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:01.400
of calligraphy.
In the interview.

267
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.120
He described his own mathematical theory behind how you can tell if a pen is

268
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.350
perfect for calligraphy.

269
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.680
Having to dip the pen in in calf to every eight to 10 words means you're writing

270
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.240
with a beautiful rhythm.
He says

271
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.350
he's passionate about life and everything in it.

272
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.720
He's passionate about science and the world knows it.

273
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.870
With all this he's accomplished in his life and the celebrity status he's

274
00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:33.370
achieved.
It would be easy to excuse Tyson for having a large ego,
but he doesn't.

275
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.100
In fact,

276
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.550
you take special pains to point down to the danger of ego if you already go

277
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:40.660
starts out,
I am important.
I am big.
I am special.

278
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.160
You're in for some disappointments.

279
00:15:42.161 --> 00:15:45.850
When you look around what we have discovered about the universe.
No,

280
00:15:45.851 --> 00:15:47.470
you're not big.
No,
you're not.

281
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.550
You're small in time and space and do you have this frail old vessel called the

282
00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.860
human body that's limited on earth.

283
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.820
Perhaps this attitude is a large part of his success and why he is so beloved

284
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.360
for all his intelligence and his contributions to the study of space.

285
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:06.510
Neil degrasse Tyson remains firmly planted with two feet right here on earth.

286
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.590
