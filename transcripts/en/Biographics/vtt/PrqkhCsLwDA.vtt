1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned Winston Churchill with his signature cane,</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>drinking scotch whiskey and puffing on a Cuban cigar in his mouth.</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>His downs end and his voice as gruff and his words pointed.</v>

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>This is the image of that Hollywood portrays,</v>

5
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but it is a caricature of the flesh and blood version.</v>

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So who was Winston Churchill in Britain's darkest hour?</v>

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Churchill lead his country from the brink of Nazi conquest by forging an</v>

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>alliance with the US and Russia.</v>

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>He had many critics and made mistakes on a grand scale,</v>

10
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>yet above all possessed and unwavering belief in his own power to his beloved</v>

11
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>he offered his blood toil,</v>

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>tears and sweat binds the political figure.</v>

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.993
<v Speaker 1>Who's a family man,</v>

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>a man of literary distinction and artist,</v>

16
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>a great lover of pets and a tinkerer.</v>

17
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.591
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

18
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:44.311
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill,</v>

19
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>that many hobbies today on biographics,</v>

20
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>we painted the complex picture of the lion.</v>

21
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>So Winston Churchill,</v>

22
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>so winston,</v>

23
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.630
<v Speaker 1>who was born on November the 30th,</v>

24
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:01.901
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

25
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>74 into the upper echelons of British society.</v>

26
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.310
<v Speaker 1>His father was Lord Randolph,</v>

27
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Henry Spence at Churchill,</v>

28
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 1>a prominent politician,</v>

29
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>and the third son of the seventh duke of Marlborough Churchill's mother Jennie</v>

30
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Jerome was an American beauty and socialites,</v>

31
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of a wealthy New York stockbroker and finance financier.</v>

32
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>The glamorous couple would seem like a match made in heaven,</v>

33
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>but they lived mostly apart and carried on separate lives.</v>

34
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 1>They also couldn't really be bothered with the young Winston,</v>

35
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>the very privileged of his pedigree,</v>

36
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Eden's afford in the kind of love and affection that he sought from his parents.</v>

37
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

38
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.303
<v Speaker 1>throughout his life,</v>

39
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>both father and his mother were distance and neglectful.</v>

40
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately for the young Winston,</v>

41
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>there was one adult in his life who provided emotional support and acted like a</v>

42
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>mother figure.</v>

43
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Churchill's Natty Elizabeth Everest,</v>

44
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>William as Winston called her after a failed attempt at saying women as a child</v>

45
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.350
<v Speaker 1>was hired to care for Winston when he was one month old,</v>

46
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>she would remain his only real friends and confidence throughout his childhood.</v>

47
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>When she passed away,</v>

48
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Churchill said of her,</v>

49
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>she had been my dearest ends.</v>

50
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Most intimate friends during the whole 20 years I've lived,</v>

51
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I shall never know,</v>

52
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.150
<v Speaker 1>such a friend to gain.</v>

53
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Winston was just seven years old when he was sent away to some Georgia school.</v>

54
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>It's got a boarding school.</v>

55
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It was not uncommon for schoolchildren in upper class society to be sent away,</v>

56
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but his mother dropped him off at Paddington station alone to catch the train at</v>

57
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>his first school.</v>

58
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Winston was bullied and bruised by the headmaster who commonly birched the</v>

59
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

60
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>a form of corporal punishment that involved striking the bottoms of boys that</v>

61
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>misbehaved with visible scars on Winston from the beatings and pleased from his</v>

62
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>loving nanny.</v>

63
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.510
<v Speaker 1>His parents withdrew him and placed him in the Brighton School in 18.</v>

64
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:38.344
<v Speaker 1>80 two.</v>

65
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Winston escapes the brutality of his first school,</v>

66
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>but not the lessons of Brighton which he despised.</v>

67
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Winston hated the regiments and was rebellious.</v>

68
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>His poor academic scores and speech impediments or less made Winston and easy</v>

69
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>targets and subject to ridicule.</v>

70
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.551
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

71
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>eth winston enrolls at the Harris school bus with a bismal entry scores he</v>

72
00:02:56.861 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>placed at the bottom of his class that Winston excelled in the subjects that</v>

73
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:01.481
<v Speaker 1>interest in him,</v>

74
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>including English and history.</v>

75
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>He also demonstrated a pro athlete for the sport of fencing,</v>

76
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>winning the public schools fencing championship.</v>

77
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Yet the few bright spots were overshadowed by deepest sadness.</v>

78
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Winston recalled in retrospect those years for not only the least agreeable,</v>

79
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but also the only baron and unhappy part of my life.</v>

80
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill nearly died from the self imposed active provider at the age</v>

81
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>of 18 when he jumped off a bridge,</v>

82
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.850
<v Speaker 1>he would later India,</v>

83
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>three days of unconsciousness,</v>

84
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>a ruptured kidney,</v>

85
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>and three months in bet it happens.</v>

86
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>When the teenager was playing chase with his 12 year old brother Jack and his 14</v>

87
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>year old cousin while vacationing at that answer state.</v>

88
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>According to Churchill and his 1930 memoir,</v>

89
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>he was trapped on a rustic bridge with brother at one ends and cousin and the</v>

90
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

91
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Rather than be captured,</v>

92
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Churchill leaped from the bridge aiming for a pine tree to slide down.</v>

93
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>You greatly misjudged the distance and fell the full height onto hard grounds.</v>

94
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was extremely lucky to survive,</v>

95
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be his last brush with death.</v>

96
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Indeed during his life,</v>

97
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was prone to accidents including crashing a plane while learning to</v>

98
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:03.251
<v Speaker 1>fly it,</v>

99
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>nearly drowning in a lake,</v>

100
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>falling several times from horses and getting hit by a car while trying to cross</v>

101
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>New York's Fifth Avenue</v>

102
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>due to his poor grades as heroism pitch.</v>

103
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Churchill's only chance at a career was through the army.</v>

104
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.820
<v Speaker 1>It took Churchill three attempts to pass the exam for the royal military college</v>

105
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:23.654
<v Speaker 1>at Sandhurst.</v>

106
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Churchill described taking the portion of the exam and leaving it completely</v>

107
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 1>blank except for his name and number of blot and several smudges.</v>

108
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.770
<v Speaker 1>His father had wanted him to be in the infantry,</v>

109
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Speaker 1>but his scores were not good enough for the cavalry.</v>

110
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.420
<v Speaker 1>The new training at Santa excited Churchill,</v>

111
00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 1>and over the next 18 months,</v>

112
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:40.790
<v Speaker 1>churchill thrived.</v>

113
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.630
<v Speaker 1>He recalled I was no longer handicapped by past neglect of Latin,</v>

114
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:45.890
<v Speaker 1>French or mathematics.</v>

115
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.270
<v Speaker 1>We now have to learn fresh things and we all started equal tactics,</v>

116
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.051
<v Speaker 1>fortification,</v>

117
00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:51.770
<v Speaker 1>typography,</v>

118
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.110
<v Speaker 1>military law and military fortification forms.</v>

119
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>The entire curriculum in addition were drill gymnastics and writing.</v>

120
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Churchill finished 20th out of 130,</v>

121
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and his graduating class,</v>

122
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Judge Hill craved action and show no fear on the battlefronts.</v>

123
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Churchill knew that he was destined for great things and he had to prove it to</v>

124
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

125
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and war provided the perfect opportunity to do so.</v>

126
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Churchill served in the British army.</v>

127
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:15.140
<v Speaker 1>There are only for a short time from 1895 to 18,</v>

128
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.890
<v Speaker 1>99,</v>

129
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.640
<v Speaker 1>and during the same time wrote a military reports for newspapers as well as two</v>

130
00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:20.210
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

131
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.750
<v Speaker 1>The story of the malecon field force and the river war in 18,</v>

132
00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:24.171
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>

133
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Churchill stepped into politics trying to win the election to the House of</v>

134
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.321
<v Speaker 1>Commons,</v>

135
00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>but he failed without hesitation.</v>

136
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:33.140
<v Speaker 1>He traveled to South Africa to cover Britain's war with the boss and say London</v>

137
00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>postwar correspondence at the age of 25.</v>

138
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Churchill arrived in Cape Town with 18 bottles of Scotch and the guarantee of</v>

139
00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 1>$150,000 in today's money for a four month assignments.</v>

140
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 1>One day,</v>

141
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Churchill admitted to his brother.</v>

142
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.240
<v Speaker 1>There is no ambition.</v>

143
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I cherished suit kingly as to gain a reputation for personal courage.</v>

144
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 1>He would say to get the chance to earn that reputation in South Africa while</v>

145
00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>covering the watch that show it was a board of train soldiers sent on a</v>

146
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>reconnaissance mission.</v>

147
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>The train was suddenly ambushed by the enemy and Churchill immediately sprung</v>

148
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.690
<v Speaker 1>into action under fire.</v>

149
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>He acted like a decorated general and ordered the soldiers with him to flee to</v>

150
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>

151
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Most of them did,</v>

152
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but Churchill was captured as a prisoner of war and sent to Pretoria Churchill's</v>

153
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>conditions in captivity.</v>

154
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>They could have been worse.</v>

155
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>The bose allow prisoners to buy cigarettes,</v>

156
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>beer and newspapers that churchill hated every moment of it,</v>

157
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>feeding the opportunity for glory so that slipping in by one night with no real</v>

158
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>plan of how to make it out of 300 miles of enemy territory.</v>

159
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>He made a daring escape.</v>

160
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>A massive manhunt ensued and the fugitive Churchill was wanted dead or alive.</v>

161
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>He avoided capture traveling at night and drinking water from streams and when</v>

162
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>he could go no further,</v>

163
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>he took a chance by knocking on a stranger's door on the other side.</v>

164
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>He knew not whether that'd be friend or foe saved too by pure chance or fate.</v>

165
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>It was an Englishman who wants it.</v>

166
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>I felt like a drowning man pulled out of the water chapter,</v>

167
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>would recall the Englishman was John Howard Cole,</v>

168
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>mine manager who had just hill in a pitch black mine before he could be smuggled</v>

169
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 1>to safety during this time in the mine wraps,</v>

170
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>which actually say any company in Brisbane,</v>

171
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the story of an English lord son Escaping prison camp and humiliating the bose</v>

172
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>was a boost to the nation.</v>

173
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>He became a hero and to celebrity pretty much over night</v>

174
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.850
<v Speaker 1>with a hero's welcome and new,</v>

175
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:19.681
<v Speaker 1>found his popularity.</v>

176
00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Churchill ran for office and this time in 1900,</v>

177
00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he was elected as a member of parliaments in the House of Commons.</v>

178
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>This was the start of a 55 year long political career with the highest of the</v>

179
00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:33.060
<v Speaker 1>highest and the lowest of the lows.</v>

180
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Churchill once said,</v>

181
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.430
<v Speaker 1>politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous in war.</v>

182
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.690
<v Speaker 1>You can only be killed once,</v>

183
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but in politics,</v>

184
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.910
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>

185
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Georgia was a conservative when he first stepped into the House of Commons,</v>

186
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but he repeatedly clashed with his party on a number of issues.</v>

187
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Free trade was crucial in his mind,</v>

188
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:51.540
<v Speaker 1>and in 1904,</v>

189
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:55.110
<v Speaker 1>it was his party supporting terrorists that made church or cross the floor to</v>

190
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 1>the opposing liberal site.</v>

191
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It infuriated his fellow conservatives,</v>

192
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.180
<v Speaker 1>but it proved to be great timing.</v>

193
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.470
<v Speaker 1>The liberals to control soon after as a newfound liberal church concerns himself</v>

194
00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:08.280
<v Speaker 1>with social reforms and laid the groundwork for the postwar welfare state</v>

195
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.810
<v Speaker 1>general again rapids.</v>

196
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.060
<v Speaker 1>We'll switch sides back to the Conservative Party.</v>

197
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 1>In 1925,</v>

198
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Speaker 1>the flippant politician was highly criticized for the moves and he was seen as</v>

199
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:18.960
<v Speaker 1>an untrustworthy opportunist.</v>

200
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Churchill's greatest political failure,</v>

201
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.070
<v Speaker 1>though the one that nearly ruined his career,</v>

202
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.750
<v Speaker 1>came in 1915.</v>

203
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 1>World War One was at a stalemate along the western France with allied troops</v>

204
00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 1>engaged in deadly trench warfare,</v>

205
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>anxious to ended Britain's war cabinet,</v>

206
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:34.890
<v Speaker 1>has authorized a bold military attack.</v>

207
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.570
<v Speaker 1>The mastermind of the 40 year old first lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill.</v>

208
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.290
<v Speaker 1>The campaign would send troops over 1000 miles to the east,</v>

209
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.090
<v Speaker 1>establishing a second front to eventually sees Constantinople and take control</v>

210
00:08:48.091 --> 00:08:50.310
<v Speaker 1>of the sea route from Europe to Russia.</v>

211
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>The plan involved a naval attacks through the Dardanelles Straits and then a</v>

212
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>land invasion on the gallopinto peninsula in modern day Turkey,</v>

213
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>lack of intelligence and competence and hesitation by military commanders</v>

214
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>created the perfect storm and the campaign went horribly wrong.</v>

215
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Half of the ships were lost and a blood bath on the shores lasted nine months in</v>

216
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:15.981
<v Speaker 1>all 45,000 allied troops in 65,000 Turkish troops lost their lives right or</v>

217
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>wrong church or bore the brunt of this failure and it forced his resignation</v>

218
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>from politics.</v>

219
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.793
<v Speaker 1>For Awhile.</v>

220
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Churchill,</v>

221
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>he used this opportunity to return to the waterfront,</v>

222
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 1>to gallop and the campaign haunted Churchill for decades.</v>

223
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.701
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

224
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 1>the Dardanelles was a favorite tunes from political opponents throughout his</v>

225
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

226
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>A second controversy would play a churchill for a decade and send them into</v>

227
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 1>political exile.</v>

228
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>A period known as the wilderness years.</v>

229
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 1>In 1929,</v>

230
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 1>a debate erupted over self governance in India,</v>

231
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>which was at the time under British rule,</v>

232
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was no doubt and imperialist and was vehemently opposed.</v>

233
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 1>He also had no love for Gandhi.</v>

234
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 1>You saw him as a threat to the British empire and went so far as to say,</v>

235
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Gandy should not be released on the account of a mere threat of fasting.</v>

236
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 1>We should be rid of a bad man as an enemy of the empire if he died,</v>

237
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>except for the most right wing of conservatives.</v>

238
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Job sure was alone in his position.</v>

239
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Much has been written about Winston Churchill,</v>

240
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>the Statesman,</v>

241
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but what was the bulldog at home?</v>

242
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Who was he to his friends and his family.</v>

243
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.490
<v Speaker 1>When Clemency Clementine Hosea met the 29 year old Winston in 19 Oh,</v>

244
00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:25.330
<v Speaker 1>four to dance.</v>

245
00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:26.740
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't impressed.</v>

246
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.240
<v Speaker 1>He didn't ask her to dance,</v>

247
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>just stared and never said one word and was very gauche.</v>

248
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:32.891
<v Speaker 1>Four years later,</v>

249
00:10:32.891 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 1>they would meet again at a dinner party and this time a romance blossomed.</v>

250
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.750
<v Speaker 1>The couple married in 19 oh,</v>

251
00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:38.080
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

252
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.410
<v Speaker 1>and would endure 57 years together until the winstons death.</v>

253
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 90,</v>

254
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.310
<v Speaker 1>even though clementines politics differed from Winston's,</v>

255
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.390
<v Speaker 1>she was fiercely supportive and made standing by her man and number one</v>

256
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:50.224
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

257
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.890
<v Speaker 1>She quietly advised him and was the only person who could reprimand his</v>

258
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:54.580
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

259
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Clementine once said she would have loved to have been a statesman in our own</v>

260
00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:01.660
<v Speaker 1>right if she had been born with trousers rather than petticoats.</v>

261
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Winston was overbearing and temperamental at times,</v>

262
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.300
<v Speaker 1>but he was always transparent in his love for his wife.</v>

263
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Proudly Boasting to Roosevelt's.</v>

264
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I tell plenty,</v>

265
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.210
<v Speaker 1>everything on occasion the couple would find though money.</v>

266
00:11:13.211 --> 00:11:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It was a constant worry for clemens in who was born into the aristocracy that</v>

267
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.670
<v Speaker 1>wound up penniless in her youth.</v>

268
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Winston overspends enjoyed gambling and was in and out of debt during one</v>

269
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:24.730
<v Speaker 1>particularly passionate dispute.</v>

270
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Clemency famously through a plate of spinach at our husbands,</v>

271
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.413
<v Speaker 1>but it missed.</v>

272
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.570
<v Speaker 1>She also never really forgave him for buying the family home and money that's</v>

273
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.110
<v Speaker 1>chartwell doing so on the sly when she was laid up from giving birth.</v>

274
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.850
<v Speaker 1>The couple had five children,</v>

275
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 1>but only forward survive into adulthood.</v>

276
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Their third child marigolds died at the age of two and a half from septicemia,</v>

277
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:43.900
<v Speaker 1>which is an infection of the blood.</v>

278
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for her.</v>

279
00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:48.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a condition of modern day antibiotics would easily cure clementine</v>

280
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.080
<v Speaker 1>shrieked and anger like an animal immortal pain upon her daughter's death.</v>

281
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>One year later,</v>

282
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>the Churchill's fourth child,</v>

283
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Mary was born Winston.</v>

284
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>He was delighted to have the nursery and use again churchill.</v>

285
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.950
<v Speaker 1>His duties as a statesmen often took him away from home,</v>

286
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but he was devoted to his family,</v>

287
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>determined to be different from his own parents.</v>

288
00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 1>He were distance and Coles whenever he could.</v>

289
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 1>He doted upon his children.</v>

290
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>He built a tree house at the family home and used his skills as a brick layer to</v>

291
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>construct a little summer house for Mary.</v>

292
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Over 40 years at chartwell at Churchill proudly improve the property by using</v>

293
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>his own hands,</v>

294
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>building ponds,</v>

295
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.491
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

296
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.324
<v Speaker 1>and bridges.</v>

297
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 1>The traps.</v>

298
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Jules had a multitude of Pat's domestic and exotic.</v>

299
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was an animal lover and his whole life as a teen in 18,</v>

300
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:29.711
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>

301
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>he even sold his bicycle to buy a bulldog named Dodo at the family home.</v>

302
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And both cats and dogs as well as pigs,</v>

303
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>fish,</v>

304
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 1>butterfly,</v>

305
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:36.971
<v Speaker 1>sheeps,</v>

306
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 1>horses,</v>

307
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>and black swans.</v>

308
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.580
<v Speaker 1>There was even a parrot called Charlie who was rumored to Churchill,</v>

309
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.211
<v Speaker 1>talked to score,</v>

310
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:42.601
<v Speaker 1>could send.</v>

311
00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It is against Hitler and the Nazis.</v>

312
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Though this hasn't been proven and is most likely a myth when not enamored with</v>

313
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 1>politics and taxing as the savior of his country.</v>

314
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was writing,</v>

315
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 1>painting,</v>

316
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>playing Polo,</v>

317
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>laying bricks at the family home or vacationing with friends in Monte Carlo or</v>

318
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 1>some other exotic locale.</v>

319
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 1>We shall fight on the beaches.</v>

320
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 1>We shall fight on the landing grounds.</v>

321
00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 1>We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.</v>

322
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 1>We shall fight in the hills.</v>

323
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>We shall never surrender if it wasn't for Hitler and the Nazis.</v>

324
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Churchill may never have become Britain's prime minister,</v>

325
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>often losing his cabinet position.</v>

326
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>In 1929.</v>

327
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Many believed Churchill's political career was over even though he was out of</v>

328
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

329
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 1>he was not out of the public eye.</v>

330
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He continued to write books,</v>

331
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.101
<v Speaker 1>speeches,</v>

332
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:34.620
<v Speaker 1>and newspaper articles and warned of the dangers of Hitler from his time in</v>

333
00:13:34.621 --> 00:13:34.961
<v Speaker 1>Cannes.</v>

334
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 1>The predictions of the growing Nazi power and as the quest for domination was</v>

335
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:39.034
<v Speaker 1>coming true,</v>

336
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.900
<v Speaker 1>he later wrote in his memoirs,</v>

337
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 1>my warnings over the last six years had been so numerous,</v>

338
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 1>so details,</v>

339
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and we're now so terribly vindicated that no one could gain Samey at the wars</v>

340
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 1>outbreak.</v>

341
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Then prime minister Neville Chamberlain brought Churchill back into the fray as</v>

342
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Britain's first lord of the Admiralty,</v>

343
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 1>the same position that he held during the first world war.</v>

344
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Chamberlain had tried and failed to strike a peace deal with Hitler,</v>

345
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.210
<v Speaker 1>and he showed himself to be incapable of turning the rapid tide of fascism.</v>

346
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Chamberlain had also lost the support of his cabinet when British troops can</v>

347
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 1>prevent the occupation of Norway.</v>

348
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 1>In 1948,</v>

349
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>chamber then resigned and Churchill took over as prime minister at the darkest</v>

350
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

351
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 1>That same day,</v>

352
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.180
<v Speaker 1>may the 10th Hitler invaded Holland,</v>

353
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Belgium and the Netherlands.</v>

354
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was a brilliant orator,</v>

355
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>thanks to his mastery of words.</v>

356
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 1>He inspired his countrymen to fight and some of his speeches during the early</v>

357
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:28.600
<v Speaker 1>days of the war.</v>

358
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

359
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:33.310
<v Speaker 1>some of the most powerful in the English language victory was the only option.</v>

360
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.720
<v Speaker 1>He never even considered a feat even when the outlook looks most grim.</v>

361
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 1>When France fell to the Nazis person was alone in its fight.</v>

362
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Churchill knew his islands nation could not win the war alone.</v>

363
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>He would need the United States,</v>

364
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>and when Germany invaded Russia,</v>

365
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Churchill saw an opportunity to forge an unlikely alliance.</v>

366
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Britain came to Stalin's ends and Churchill defended the decision during this</v>

367
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:00.290
<v Speaker 1>desperate time saying no one has been a more consistent opponents of communism</v>

368
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>for the last 25 years.</v>

369
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I will unsay no word I have spoken about it,</v>

370
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>but all of this fades away before the spectacle which is now unfolding the past</v>

371
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:09.891
<v Speaker 1>with its crimes.</v>

372
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:10.461
<v Speaker 1>It's follies,</v>

373
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>its tragedies,</v>

374
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.553
<v Speaker 1>flashes away.</v>

375
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>The Russian danger is that for our danger and the danger of the United States,</v>

376
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.290
<v Speaker 1>just as the cause of any Russian fighting for half and house is the cause of</v>

377
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:26.291
<v Speaker 1>free men and free peoples in every quarter of the globe to forge the big three</v>

378
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:30.020
<v Speaker 1>alliance church who have cultivated a friendship with the American president,</v>

379
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Franklin d dot Roosevelt.</v>

380
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.980
<v Speaker 1>This was something that would convince him to join the war effort.</v>

381
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>He invited himself to the White House and arrive two weeks after the bombing of</v>

382
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Pearl Harbor.</v>

383
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 1>The prime minister stayed three weeks,</v>

384
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:40.690
<v Speaker 1>three Christmas albums.</v>

385
00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Well policy as welcome in Eleanor Roosevelt's eyes,</v>

386
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>but it was absolutely critical to solidifying their alliance and winning over</v>

387
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the Americans the tube on do they have a daily lunches and late nights</v>

388
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 1>strategizing by the time you left ftl founds that he missed his friends and send</v>

389
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 1>a note to Churchill in London,</v>

390
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>which reds it is fun to be in the same decade with you,</v>

391
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 1>with the Americans now in the war and the Russians fighting on the side of the</v>

392
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>

393
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's armies were pushed back and victory was declared on May the eighth,</v>

394
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:07.011
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

395
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>45 in Europe.</v>

396
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Three months later in the East,</v>

397
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Japan surrenders marking the end of world war two.</v>

398
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.371
<v Speaker 1>In a surprise,</v>

399
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 1>that very same year,</v>

400
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Churchill did not win reelection.</v>

401
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Following the ward,</v>

402
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Churchill continue to influence world affairs.</v>

403
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.720
<v Speaker 1>He gave his speech on the iron and about the USSR threats and was strongly in</v>

404
00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:31.410
<v Speaker 1>favor of person's independence from the European coal and steel community,</v>

405
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.060
<v Speaker 1>which was set up after the war,</v>

406
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:36.030
<v Speaker 1>so you neutralize European competition for natural resources.</v>

407
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Churchill actually served as prime minister again in 1951 and resigns at the age</v>

408
00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:41.040
<v Speaker 1>of 18.</v>

409
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It was at this time that he was in deteriorating health.</v>

410
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was intense on leaving his mark on history,</v>

411
00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:49.710
<v Speaker 1>not just through clamoring for fame and power or placing himself at the center</v>

412
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:50.470
<v Speaker 1>of the action.</v>

413
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

414
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.810
<v Speaker 1>he would write his own story and solidify a favorable view to be passed through</v>

415
00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the ages at the end of world war two,</v>

416
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Churchill wrote as best selling series,</v>

417
00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Second World War,</v>

418
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and won the Nobel Prize in literature in Nineteen 53 and that same year,</v>

419
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.460
<v Speaker 1>he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth the second in 1965 after suffering a stroke</v>

420
00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:09.294
<v Speaker 1>two weeks earlier.</v>

421
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill pass from this life until the next.</v>

422
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>

423
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.220
<v Speaker 1>The whole world felt the loss and reporters remarked that it was the end of an</v>

424
00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:17.760
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

425
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.420
<v Speaker 1>The queen saw to it that Churchill's funeral was the grandest of any commoner</v>

426
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.231
<v Speaker 1>since 18,</v>

427
00:17:22.231 --> 00:17:23.010
<v Speaker 1>52,</v>

428
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.600
<v Speaker 1>which was on a scale.</v>

429
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.340
<v Speaker 1>The fitting has position in history.</v>

430
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.640
<v Speaker 1>His body lay in state in Westminster Hall for three days and nights,</v>

431
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.670
<v Speaker 1>and it's no fewer than 320,000 people filed past to pay their respects.</v>

432
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.230
<v Speaker 1>And as we move towards the end of this video,</v>

433
00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:38.490
<v Speaker 1>let me mention something interesting.</v>

434
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago,</v>

435
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.920
<v Speaker 1>a fifth of all British teenagers.</v>

436
00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Polls believed Churchill to be a fictional character.</v>

437
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.730
<v Speaker 1>His legends indeed may seem larger than life and knowing them and apart from his</v>

438
00:17:47.731 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>greatest moment on the world stage is to grasp.</v>

439
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 1>To say he was complex and contradictory is an understatement.</v>

440
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.180
<v Speaker 1>We know he held himself in the highest regards,</v>

441
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but Churchill also suffered in the depths of depression.</v>

442
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 1>He referred to it as his black dog.</v>

443
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 1>His stubbornness courage,</v>

444
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 1>grits and his brilliance with words made an indispensable and his legacy is one</v>

445
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 1>that will live on and inspire the good fight and no doubt Joshua will continue</v>

446
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>to be judged and analyzed through the ages for his failed decisions and on</v>

447
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 1>popular attitudes.</v>

448
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 1>He was a product of the time with an impossible job.</v>

449
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Statesmen are not called upon to settle easy questions.</v>

450
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>These often settle themselves.</v>

451
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 1>It is where the balance quivers and as the proportions are veiled in mystery</v>

452
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 1>that the opportunity for weld saving decisions presents itself.</v>

453
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>So I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.</v>
