He was killed in a working accidents.

24
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.700
This left him as the family patriarch with the collapse of the Soviet Union life

25
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:31.760
in the region.
It changed dramatically.
Labor became entrepreneurs overnight.

26
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.070
As the Western economies began flooding in and found a job as a car repairman.

27

he realized that he had to move to the newly created republic of Chechnya,

29
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.550
which seems like the new promised land.

Jugaad duty of within just a year though,
things had gone horribly wrong.

34
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.170
The Russians invaded Chechnya and the Sony has found themselves in the middle of

35
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:03.580
a war zone.
The family,

00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:14.770
eastern Europe.
Their goal,

40
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.490
well that was America and Zoran Zuber Darts believed that their chances of

41
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:21.880
getting to America would be improved if they obtained some educational

42
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:23.340
credentials.
As a result,

43
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.310
they both began studying your part time after four years and talk mark and they

44

sold the family home and moved not to America,

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.070
but [inaudible] hometown of Dagestan.
However,

46
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:36.530
it seemed as if his family where I've done able to escape from Warren's before

47
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:39.460
along the streets were filled with gunfights and explosions.

53
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.790
claiming that his life was in danger due to his connections with Chechnya.

The Sani of said chosen to come to Boston,
Massachusetts.

56
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360
That was web.
Some friends had moved to previous year,

57
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.370
so at least they would know somebody.

58
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.950
They moved in with this couple and the eight year old gighub again,

59
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.770
attending second grade at a public school along with the tube.

60
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.030
You have children in April of 2002 and sort of managed to find an inexpensive

61
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:26.050
apartment in Cambridge,

62
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.800
Massachusetts and they moved out of the BF home and into their own place.

63
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.970
Droga was left with a the for the meantime in order to not interrupt his school.

64
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.840
Yeah,
and Zora and exhibit hours presented themselves as prospective lawyers even

65
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:40.270
though their studies had been minimal.
When people lost,

66
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.700
they told them that they were fleeing from ethnic strife.

67
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.490
They found a kindred spirit in their landlord,
Johanna,
her,

68
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.200
he who took them under her wing.

69
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.160
She took z arts too and Amnesty International events focused on human rights

70
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:54.940
abuses in Chechnya and even paid for her to enrolled in a Harvard extension

course on negotiation and Zar picks off under the table jobs fixing cars for $10

72
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.450
an hour.
When the school year was over,

73
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.900
Juggalo came to live with his parents and Cambridge.
His time with a B.

74
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.770
Abs had been challenging.

75
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.190
His parents insisted that the only language spoken in the home was Chechen,

76
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.430
which he could barely understand when the parents weren't around.

77
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:13.690
The children would speak Russian.

78
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.440
He learned English from his association with American Kids at school picking

79
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.820
your town,
but at an amazing pace.

80
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.180
Jirga became an accepted member of the church and Community of children in the

81
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.450
local area.
He was a good students.
He made quick advancements.
In fact,

82
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.770
during his second year at school,

83
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.940
he was bumped up from the third grade to the fourth in mid 2003 the Siana,

84
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.170
his asylum application.

85
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.370
It was granted the three children left Kurgestan and we are now free to join the

86
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.940
family and the promised lands with the family.
Ray United.

87
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.230
Things were looking pretty good for the immigrant family,

88
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.550
both on Zuora and Zubid Artois working and they had permanence and affordable

89
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.960
accommodation.
Wow.

90
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.320
Joe Guh is remembered as a sweet,
lovable boy.
He was described as being charming.

91
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.600
His teachers described him as being Bryce,

92
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.480
but lacking in the ability to think creatively for himself.

93
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.090
He tended to see things that got other people to like him.

94
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.700
In 2003 a Juggalo and did the fifth grade.

95
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.900
His sister's 13 year olds leaner and 15 year old Barolo were in seventh and

96
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:16.230
ninth grades.
17 year old.
Tom Allen was in 10th grade.
The landlady,

97
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.850
Joanna tutored the children in English and took them to movies and let them

98
00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:20.870
watch DVDs.

99
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.230
Tom Allen now augmented his studies with Joanna by reading Sherlock Holmes

100
00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:26.380
stories.
Being the oldest son,
Tom Milan,

101
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.500
was the focus of the families' plans for success.
He was the golden haired child,

102
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:34.520
the one who was destined for greatness.
He was tall,
muscular,
and handsome.

103
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.040
Even the Americans saw something special in him.

104
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.270
Anzel decided that before heading off to college,

105
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:47.940
his oldest son would become a champion boxer,

106
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.460
tamarind and proved himself to be a gifted fighter.

107
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.810
Yet a very unconventional stance with his arms hanging down rather than in a

108
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:59.060
defensive stance after training with his for a while and he turns up at a local

109
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:00.190
martial arts gym.
Yup.

110
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.830
No malfeasance helmets or other protective gear and his claims that he didn't

111
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.320
need them.
When are you going into the ring?
He proved it.

112
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.280
His stage and admission was to win a spot on the U S and Olympic team and to use

113
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.490
that position as a way of becoming a naturalized US citizen.

114
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.840
Thailand's first victory in a boxing competition was achieved in January of 2004

115
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.420
it was a golden gloves homage bout had in lowel,

116
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:24.890
Massachusetts and his post to victory interview.
He said,
I like the USA.

117
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.490
You have a chance to make some money here if you are willing to work.

118
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.410
In 2006 ton.
Elon was enrolled at Bunker Hill community college for two years.

119
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.190
He focused on his studies.
Then in 2009 and he returned to boxing.

120
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.820
We then a year he had made it onto the national amateur boxing circuits.

121
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.990
In 2010 he won the rocky Marciano trophy for winning the New England golden

122
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.510
gloves competition,
but because he wasn't a US citizen,

123
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:49.970
he was ineligible to fight for the national title.

124
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.410
This was a severe blow to Tom Landon's.

125
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.970
It caused him to just give up on his boxing career.
By that time,

126
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.190
Tom Atlanta also dropped out of college.

127
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.280
His focus was now on becoming a music stop.

128
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.810
He began dressing flamboyantly with one person describing as looks is that of an

129
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:09.830
Italian Gigolo.
While American teenage boys might have marked as looks,

130
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:11.810
the girls were in Trump stunts.

131
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:16.670
He had no shortage of female admires and 2011 Tamela and the great hope of that

132
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:21.020
son.
Our family was a failed to boxer,
a college dropout,
and a father.

133
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.790
He was still living at home with his parents,

134
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:25.340
but his girlfriends and child when not for money,

135
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:28.550
he delivered pizzas parttime and sold marijuana on the site.

136
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.540
It was not exactly the career path that his parents had had in mind despite

137
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.420
their initial efforts to integrate into American society.

138
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.810
By 2011 that sign Sinovis had given up on trying.

139
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.310
After struggling with the language,

140
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:43.250
with the culture and even with buying things on credit,

141
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.740
they reverted back to what they were comfortable with.

142
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.480
They decided to live as Chechens transplanted their home at the typical Czechian

143
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:55.190
look,
oriental rugs,
a large plush surface and a mirrored Credenza,
housing plates.

144
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.100
Things had not planned out like they envisioned their neighbors.

145
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:01.580
They viewed them with suspicion if not with outright hostility.

146
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.050
There son was dealing drugs,

147
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:07.160
both their daughters and entered into disastrous marriages and Enzo was spending

148
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:09.320
his days fixing old cars in the street.

149
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.260
In mid 2011 Jogi graduated from Rindge college and moved to the University of

150
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:23.890
Massachusetts at Dartmouth where he lived on campus.
A couple of months later.

151
00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:26.110
His parents,
they filed for divorce by now.

152
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:29.020
All of the rest of his family had become disillusioned with their life in

153
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:30.850
America,
but not Jakafi.

154
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.720
He continued to make good grades and establish a solid and positive friendships.

155
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.720
He maintained his friendly,
happy outlook,
had called edge.

156
00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:38.860
He joined the wrestling team.

157
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.160
He impressed as coaches with his humility and constant requests,

158
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.510
what he could do to improve.

159
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.010
It was a marked contrast to the American boys on the team who did not do this

160
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.760
before long.

161
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.360
He was the captain of the wrestling team just like his older brother.
However,

162
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:55.490
Chagall was smoking and also selling dope.
Yes,

163
00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:57.690
his image of the pure sweet teenage boy.

164
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:01.380
It was so complete that no one had any inkling that this was the case.

165
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.190
Droga develops a friendship with one of the colleges,
most respected professors.

166
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.900
Larry Aronson was the college's official photographer,
Aronson adults,

167
00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:12.840
a jirga as the poster child for kids from war torn zone and see what now

168
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.100
attending Rindge college.

169
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.400
He also helped the boy come up with a more American friendly version of his
name.

170
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.570
Josh Aronson was interested in engaging Jaeger and discussions about what was

171
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:22.500
going on in Chechnya,

172
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:26.730
but the teenager had no desire to talk about is old country.
Aronson said,

173
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.870
whenever I tried to talk to him about being Chechen,
it meant nothing to him.

174
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.970
Meanwhile,
Joe,
his older brother,
Tamerlan,
was moving in the other direction.

175
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.970
In January of 2012 he flew to Dagestan.

176
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.110
He went to his old hometown of Maca color.
This was the carbs.

177
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.640
I love Dagestan nuns.
Over the last 10 years,

178
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:53.300
it has transformed into a modern city Tamela and quickly fit into the social

179
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:57.170
scene,
spending his days mixing with forever and young men in their twenties and

180
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.900
thirties who talked about their religion,
their aspirations,

181
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:02.780
and the injustices in the world.
He met any of his relatives,

182
00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:05.330
a number of whom were involved in organized crime.

183
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.020
Some of them joins a group called the Union of the just which was allied to the

184
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:13.100
his boots [inaudible] one of the largest Islamic organizations in the world.

185
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.900
He's told members of the group there's America was a racist country that was

186
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.960
deeply divided with corrupt police and does Zena phobic foreign policy.

187
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.650
When asked to compare America with Russia,
Tomberlin is reported to have said,

188
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.800
I refuse to choose between two kinds of fecal matter.

189
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.980
Both tastes like Shit and 2012 Tomlin's hold his associates that he urgently

190
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:35.900
needed to return to the United States because he had a problem with his

191
00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:36.770
documentation.

192
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.030
He ends up meeting that he had no desire to go back and he would return soon.

193
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.960
Tomberlin returned to Cambridge to discover that his father had himself returned

194
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:49.070
to Dagestan and had started a successful car repair business with his brother.

195
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.250
A couple of weeks later,
zipit dot also returned to Dagestan.

196
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:55.670
Not to reunite with her ex husband's,
but to live with her own family.

197
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.070
To Tom Mullen Dagestan it was now home.

198
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.780
He would only stand the u s long enough to get his passport.
Jonah,
hello.

199
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.510
He's the landlord had become increasingly concerned with the radicalization of

200
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:06.650
the family.
After a,

201
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:10.310
he didn't council with Tom Alon in which he vented about his hatred of America.

202
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.410
She issued them an eviction notice

203
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.910
back at college.
John got a new roommate.

204
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.650
Andrew Dwindles was a young American go getter.

205
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.570
The engineering major was going places and there's a very presence highlighted

206
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:31.560
to jihad.
Just how inadequate he really was.
The two never spoken,

207
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.800
only exchanged messages when one of them was locked out of the room.

208
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.380
Shahar had a small and tight knit group of friends.

209
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:38.940
All of them being eastern European.

210
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.930
There was also a steady flow of customers to his dorm room in order to buy pot.

211
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.701
Within a few months,

212
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:47.370
your whole social circle had widened slightly to include a couple of Americans.

213
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.590
They congregated off campus at the apartments,

214
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:52.950
have a couple of members of the group once jar disclose to a couple of members

215
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.670
of that group the tenure to make a bomb.

216
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.670
He also said that there were parts of the Quran that will worth fighting for

217
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:00.640
with force is still,
he was not a Muslim extremist though.

218
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.270
Those in his group who had met his brother,
considered Tom Alon to be one

219
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.111
Patriot's day,

220
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.640
2013 a casual on April the 15th it's a public holiday in Massachusetts and it's

221
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.550
the day that the Boston marathon is run two hours after the start of the

222
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:22.600
marathon at 2:49 PM there's runners with streaming across the finish line.

223
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.880
Two bombs exploded near the end of the course.

224
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.770
Three people were killed and 264 others were wounded in the immediate aftermath

225
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:30.281
of the bombing,

226
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:34.000
the police scan the crowd in an attempt to identify anyone who looked out of

227
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:34.540
place.

228
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.020
The first target was a Saudi Arabian man who had actually been wounded in the

229
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:38.680
blog posts.

230
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.740
He was quickly cleared and then three other Muslim men were looked at,

231
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:43.600
but all were dismissed.
On Thursday,

232
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:47.470
April the 18th the Boston post published a photo when it's from page with a band

233
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:51.190
of that red bag.
Then fed seek these two pictures of Boston marathon.

234
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.210
The two men were Tom Mullen and do your hot sauna have when Larry runs and

235
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:55.781
picked up the pay,

236
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:58.570
but he thought that one of the men looked amazingly like jihad.

237
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.760
Then when students at the university,
so the picture,

238
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:04.420
they didn't think that it looks like Jihad and they were convinced that it was

239
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:08.100
him.
Still.
His friends couldn't believe that he had been involved in the bombing.

240
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.330
He just didn't seem capable of such a thing.

241
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.290
Rather than going to the police or the FBI,
his friends went to jaws dorm,

242
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.830
but the door was locked,
unable to locate Shahar.

243
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.350
His friends went back to their dorm and proceeded to play Xbox a short time.

244
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:23.470
NASA,
one of them received a text and jaw that reds,
if you want,

245
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:25.630
you can go to my room and take.
What's that?

246
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.050
They were tends in the ream used to Spanky to get in and began to such his side

247
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:29.710
of the room.

248
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.460
One of them found a black backpack that contained a launch metal cylinder off an

249
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:36.010
empty jar of Vaseline.
He turned to his friends and said,

250
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.960
I think he used these to make the bomb.

251
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.250
The FBI had been focused on Jihad as early as Wednesday morning.

252
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.550
They had been studying video of the aftermath of the explosions and it was

253
00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:53.040
noticed that Jihad didn't react to the blast.

254
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.150
While everyone else ran duct and screams,
he just kept right on walking.

255
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.320
They also noticed tunnel and walking alongside showing no sign of reaction,

256
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.810
but the problem was they had no idea where these men were,

257
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.870
the images they were issued to the American public with a warning that they were

258
00:14:06.871 --> 00:14:10.200
considered to be armed and extremely dangerous in the hours following the

259
00:14:10.201 --> 00:14:13.590
bombing.
Local media blames the path of every crime committed in the area,

260
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.280
including the murder of an MIT police officer.
They've got that last accusation,

261
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:20.940
right?
The brothers killed officer Shaun Collier in order to steal his gun.

262
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.180
They then committed to car jacking into Cambridge gas station.

263
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.800
They were driving a Mercedes SUV,

264
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.500
but they were unaware that it was fitted with a gps device.

265
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.780
This allowed the police to track their every movement.

266
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.760
They seem to be driving around aimlessly,

267
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:36.240
which they were because they had no plan of action post bombing in their

268
00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:39.330
possession.
The brothers had five homemade explosive devices,

269
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.750
a semiautomatic handgun,
a machete and a hunting knife

270
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.750
they he was doing on the brothers in a quiet suburban in the suburb of Watertown

271
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.110
and began randomly firing.

272
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.780
One of the offices was seriously wounded by friendly fire.

273
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.290
The brothers were the Helene to cover ans when ordered to give up Shahar through

274
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:04.250
the explosive devices towards the cops.
They exploded harmlessly on the street.

275
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.410
The final shootout was between Tamma Landon's,

276
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.070
Watertown police officer named Jed prerelease.

277
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.010
The officer scored several body heads swell.
Thailand failed to find his targets.

278
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.590
When his ammunition ran out,
he threw his gun at the officer.

279
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.930
He then decided to flee and the officer's chased him.

280
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.300
They see him go to him and dragged him to the ground,

281
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.720
but now jihad jumps behind the wheel of the SUV and proceeded to run down the

282
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:26.200
offices.
They quickly jumped aside and on.

283
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.900
Wizardly ran over the top of his brother dragging the body 30 feet down the

284
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:33.050
street,
leaving his brother dying on the road to hoe sped away.

285
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.830
It took nearly a minute for the police to give chase.
By then ditched the car,

286
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:39.260
runs run off into the suburbs,
but the police offices,

287
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.550
they scoured backyards in dozens of suburbs and thousands of people were ordered

288
00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:44.910
to evacuate the homes.
Uh,

289
00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:48.530
Watertown homeowner reported seeing blood on the side of a boat in his yard.

290
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.450
I Swat team rush to the house.

291
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.090
Joe had been hiding in the cupboard boat for hours.

292
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.580
The officers attempted to coax him out with tear gas and that failed.

293
00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.650
They fired bullets to scare him out in the ends and imposing officer approached

294
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:04.160
the boat and demanded that he come out immediate beat.
A childish voice replied,

295
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.600
but it's going to hurt.

296
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.530
Police officers then moved in and help jihad make his way down from the boat.

297
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.460
He was severely wounded with either bullet or shrapnel injuries to the neck.

298
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.580
