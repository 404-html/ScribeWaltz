00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>While started out as the creative ideas of a teenage boy evolved into one of the</v>

<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

13
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 1>On December the 28th of 1922 Stanley Martin Libor was born in New York City.</v>

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.211
<v Speaker 1>His parents,</v>

15
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.021
<v Speaker 1>Jack and Celia,</v>

16
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>where Romanian Jewish immigrants who left for a better life in the United</v>

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>His father was a tailor,</v>

19
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but he was laid off during the Great Depression,</v>

20
00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>so they were constantly struggling to make rent.</v>

21
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>His parents could only afford a one bedroom apartment and they did their best to</v>

22
00:00:58.971 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>provide for their son.</v>

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>His mother and father slept on the couch and allowed him to have a real bet.</v>

24
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Most of the memories Stanley had of his father was seeing him sitting at the</v>

25
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>kitchen table,</v>

26
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>flipping through the want ads in the newspaper trying to find a new job.</v>

27
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>These were usually gigs that never lasted very long.</v>

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Eventually his father would find steady work and their lives would improve at</v>

29
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:20.294
<v Speaker 1>least a little.</v>

30
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>When he was nine years old,</v>

31
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>his mother gave birth to his younger brother,</v>

32
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>

33
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying.</v>

34
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>he got a bicycle for Christmas.</v>

36
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Stan took this opportunity to ride his bike all over New York City and hardly</v>

37
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>spent any time at home getting to know his younger brother sins.</v>

38
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>His parents were struggling so much with money.</v>

39
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>They encourage stand to get good grades so that he would have a brighter future</v>

40
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>than they did and they encouraged him to find part time jobs as soon as he</v>

41
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

42
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It took this very seriously and even skipped a few grades so that he could</v>

43
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>graduate from high school sooner.</v>

44
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>He attended an all boys school and since he was so much smaller and younger than</v>

45
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>his cost made see struggle to make friends.</v>

46
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>It was often daydreaming about his favorite movies and often had his nose in a</v>

47
00:01:58.701 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

48
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he was old enough to work,</v>

49
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>he got his first job at a garment factory.</v>

50
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>The year later he moved on to become an usher at a movie theater called the</v>

51
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:07.244
<v Speaker 1>Rivoli.</v>

52
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>He loved this job because he was allowed to see as many movies as he wanted for</v>

53
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

54
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>It was also able to make money doing something that he enjoyed and it also helps</v>

55
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>him to relieve as parents financial stress.</v>

56
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>He begins to pay for his own expenses so that his parents could focus mostly on</v>

57
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>his brother Larry,</v>

58
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>even at a young age,</v>

59
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>his parents and teachers could tell that he would grow up to be someone special</v>

60
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>at this stage in his life stat.</v>

61
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that he would be more involved in the movie business is either an actor</v>

62
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a screen right at his favorite movie growing up was the 1935 film</v>

63
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>captain blood,</v>

64
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>which was about swashbuckling pirate adventures.</v>

65
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.600
<v Speaker 1>He loved the elaborate fight scenes and would often imagine becoming the hero of</v>

66
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>these films at 15 years old.</v>

67
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Stan ends at a writing contest for the New York Herald Tribune.</v>

68
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't and the editor reached out to him to say that he should pursue writing</v>

69
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>as a full time career.</v>

70
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Seeing as he had high school early,</v>

71
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>he was able to get a job writing a bitters for a newspaper.</v>

72
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>That's after a while he felt that this was pretty boring and indeed quite</v>

73
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>morbid,</v>

74
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.020
<v Speaker 1>so he tried to see what other opportunities were out there for young writers was</v>

75
00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:12.930
<v Speaker 1>16 years olds.</v>

76
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>He got a job at timely comics assisting that artist,</v>

77
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Jack Kennedy ends the head writer,</v>

78
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>an editor or Simon,</v>

79
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>the overarching publishing company actually made most of their income from pulp</v>

80
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>fiction and comics were more of an afterthought for them.</v>

81
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.131
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

82
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Stan was pretty much hod just to make coffee and erase the pencil marks on Jack</v>

83
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Kirby's drawings as well as do various other errands.</v>

84
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Hasn't gone was any $8 a week and if we consider inflation,</v>

85
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>that's about $141 today.</v>

86
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So back then timely comics followed the trends of whatever was popular at the</v>

87
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

88
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Now DC comics within main competitor and they had superman,</v>

89
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>so the characters they created,</v>

90
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>we'll often they recycled idea in one way or another.</v>

91
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.621
<v Speaker 1>At this point in time,</v>

92
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Jackie Kirby and Joe Simon has already been inventing superheroes like the human</v>

93
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>torch and Captain America.</v>

94
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Stan was eager to move on from just making coffee,</v>

95
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>so he pitched a story for a captain America scripts off to the third issue was</v>

96
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>published.</v>

97
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>They liked his ideas and they agreed to use it in the following issue.</v>

98
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>This is when he decided that his pen name would be Stan Lee,</v>

99
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>which is just as first named Stanley's,</v>

100
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:17.154
<v Speaker 1>but at half.</v>

101
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>He figured that someday he could move on to become a novelist under his real</v>

102
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>name standing the Martin Neba when he was 18 years old,</v>

103
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:24.851
<v Speaker 1>Stanley,</v>

104
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you had been working at timely comics for two years and he was assisting Jack</v>

105
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Kirby and Joe Simon with all the various duties of that company.</v>

106
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Both Kirby Simon were having a financial dispute with marvel comics as publisher</v>

107
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Martin Goodman,</v>

108
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>and they decided to quit.</v>

109
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Stan was the only one left and his lost Austin.</v>

110
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>If he would be willing to step into the role of head writer,</v>

111
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>editor and Art Director.</v>

112
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>This was meant to be a temporary fix.</v>

113
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Goodman searched for an experienced replacements,</v>

115
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's stat and actually ended up being great at doing all of these jobs at</v>

116
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

117
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.231
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

118
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>he mainly focused on producing the captain American comics because you know,</v>

119
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>the 70 24 hours in a day and he already had his work cut out for him.</v>

120
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

121
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>the comic book industry,</v>

122
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely booming because people,</v>

123
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to escape the fears that they had about the war by reading stories</v>

124
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>of heroes both in the newspapers and in fiction World War Two at this point,</v>

125
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely raging.</v>

126
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Jack Kirby and Joe Simon.</v>

127
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>They'd already established a theme of Captain America coming face to face</v>

128
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 1>without Offit and on more than one occasion.</v>

129
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:30.061
<v Speaker 1>So Stanley carried on the legacy by acting out his fantasies of being in combat</v>

130
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>overseas,</v>

131
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Captain America comics and spired Stanley to become a real hero himself.</v>

132
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>He stays is I myself,</v>

133
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>got so caught up in all of that.</v>

134
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Next thing I knew I had enlisted in the army.</v>

135
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I fell it's all nation,</v>

136
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>was really in danger and so I couldn't live with myself if I were a civilian and</v>

137
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>other people wherever that fighting.</v>

138
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

139
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was not expected to go overseas and fight.</v>

140
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>The army recruiter looked over his resume and gave him the job of playwright.</v>

141
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>He was told to stay in the United States and write scripts for training films</v>

142
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>and public service announcements that were shown to soldiers even if this was</v>

143
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 1>not exactly the fight that Stan was looking for.</v>

144
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>This was actually a pretty big deal and all of the army play went on to have</v>

145
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>successful careers including Theodore Geisel,</v>

146
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>who is better known as Dr Seuss.</v>

147
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>So when he was 23 years old,</v>

148
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was discharged from the army and he moved back to New York City to</v>

149
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>return to his job where the name had been changed from timely comics to marvel</v>

150
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:26.954
<v Speaker 1>comics</v>

151
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>when's only returned to New York City.</v>

152
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:37.890
<v Speaker 1>He began to go out on dates and attend a lot of parties and do.</v>

153
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>He was actually pretty embarrassed to tell people that he worked for marvel.</v>

154
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>A lot of women would actually just walk away in mid conversation as soon as they</v>

155
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>heard him say comic books.</v>

156
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Clearly these girls were not the one for him all his life.</v>

157
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Stan would be doodling pictures of the perfect girl that he always imagined that</v>

158
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>he would find some day and it was like you could see a vision of the future.</v>

159
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>One night he showed up to a party when a young woman named June Clayton on,</v>

160
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>so the door stand was shocked because this was the exact same girl he had been</v>

161
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>dreaming about his entire life.</v>

162
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.933
<v Speaker 1>He blurted out,</v>

163
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>

164
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to fall in love with you.</v>

165
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Joan laughed and she thought this and the fact that he wrote comics was actually</v>

166
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:15.104
<v Speaker 1>quite charming.</v>

167
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>The only issue was that she was married to someone else.</v>

168
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.460
<v Speaker 1>She was originally from England and she had become a war bride and moved to the</v>

169
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>United States with a new husband to pursue a modeling and acting Korea.</v>

170
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>She ended up fast husbands.</v>

171
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>They were no longer happy together and once she met Stan,</v>

172
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>she knew that it was time to make her divorce official.</v>

173
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>When Stanley was 25 the do you got married and instead of having a fancy wedding</v>

174
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>or a honeymoon,</v>

175
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>they use that money to move to long island where they lived in a penthouse</v>

176
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:42.584
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

177
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>When Joan first got pregnant,</v>

178
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>she painted that entire house pink because she wanted a daughter so badly.</v>

179
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>This early works and she gave birth to a baby girl named June Juni out who they</v>

180
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>nicknamed JC.</v>

181
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years later,</v>

182
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>they had a second daughter named Jen.</v>

183
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

184
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Jen died after only being alive for seven days.</v>

185
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>This was such a traumatic experience for Joan that she didn't want to have</v>

186
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:04.904
<v Speaker 1>children again.</v>

187
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>They tried to a dark twist.</v>

188
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>They run into a lot of issues.</v>

189
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Since Dan was Jewish and Joan was episcopalian,</v>

190
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>nearly every adoption agency rejected them because of the differences in</v>

191
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>religious beliefs.</v>

192
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>While all of this was very tragic and difficult for Stanley and his wife opened</v>

193
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>up his eyes to so many issues in the country that he had been unaware of until</v>

194
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

195
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.501
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

196
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:28.580
<v Speaker 1>it would become a catalyst for his motivation to inspire other people</v>

197
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

198
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.551
<v Speaker 1>as work.</v>

199
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was still incredibly dedicated with his time at marvel comics.</v>

200
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>They called their staff the bullpen because they were pumping out a one complete</v>

201
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>comic every working day.</v>

202
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 1>He made sure to give everyone on the team credits with the names on the cover of</v>

203
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:49.671
<v Speaker 1>each comic book,</v>

204
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>which was brand new for the time.</v>

205
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>He also gave the group the nickname of the Marion marvel and marching society</v>

206
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>after he established more of a leadership role in the company's down.</v>

207
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Eventually convinced artists Jack Kennedy to returns a marvel comics since he</v>

208
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>was one of the most talented men in the business.</v>

209
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Cubbies.</v>

210
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Artwork brought Stanley's ideas to life in a way that no one else could,</v>

211
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>even though he was not an accident in the traditional sense,</v>

212
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Stan was known for acting out the roles of the characters when working as</v>

213
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Marvel's editor,</v>

214
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Erin's awesome director in order to explain what he was looking for in the</v>

215
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>storyline,</v>

216
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.720
<v Speaker 1>rather than giving an office stay fully written script to follow,</v>

217
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Stanley would give them a general story,</v>

218
00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>nine of what was going to happen and so he wanted everything to be overly</v>

219
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>dramatic like people in a silent film.</v>

220
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Once the artwork was done,</v>

221
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Stan would go back and fill in the bubbles with the appropriate dialogue.</v>

222
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>This cut down on time.</v>

223
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Significant man.</v>

224
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>

225
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 1>The marvel method in the 1950s they psychologist named Frederick what and claims</v>

226
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.720
<v Speaker 1>that comic books and television were corrupting the youth in America.</v>

227
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>In 1954 the Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency announced the comic</v>

228
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 1>books were actually dangerous.</v>

229
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 1>They started the comics code authority,</v>

230
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>which puts strict rules of censorship on what types of contents,</v>

231
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 1>where to be allowed to be published in comic books.</v>

232
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Every new story line had to be approved by the comics code or authority as the</v>

233
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:09.570
<v Speaker 1>cover of the book would have the seal showing that it had been checked for any</v>

234
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 1>indecent contents.</v>

235
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>According to the rules,</v>

236
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 1>the mention of any crime at all,</v>

237
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it was enough to have a comic rejected this censorship.</v>

238
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 1>It was a devastating blow to marvel who made their bread and butter on superhero</v>

239
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>stories about fighting crime.</v>

240
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Stanley had to lay off almost all of the artists and they had to discontinue</v>

241
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 1>many of that comics.</v>

242
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>He was forced to write new stories that were aimed at young children and they</v>

243
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>were incredibly bland and boring compared to writing about sue Harris.</v>

244
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Stanley trudged through this job for over a decade after working in the Comic</v>

245
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Book Industry for 20 Years.</v>

246
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was having a bit of a midlife crisis.</v>

247
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>He had been writing these Sydney children's from experts so long that he really</v>

248
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 1>wasn't sure he wanted to stay in the industry and DDT was already writing</v>

249
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 1>screenplays and newspaper articles on the side and he was considering leaving</v>

250
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>the comic book industry in order to write a novel.</v>

251
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.470
<v Speaker 1>The only problem was that he still had a wife and child to support and he</v>

252
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>couldn't walk away from a paycheck.</v>

253
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>He had a conversation with his wife,</v>

254
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.281
<v Speaker 1>Joan,</v>

255
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>and she encouraged him to take a chance and try to write a comic for adults.</v>

256
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Even if it went against the censorship rules,</v>

257
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 1>they decided that if it's published,</v>

258
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:13.914
<v Speaker 1>a hated it.</v>

259
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing that could happen was that he would be fired,</v>

260
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

261
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>he was ready to quit anyways,</v>

262
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 1>so really have nothing left to lose.</v>

263
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>This is when he decided to create the fantastic four.</v>

264
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 1>These characters,</v>

265
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>they're multidimensional.</v>

266
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 1>They didn't always enjoy having their superpowers.</v>

267
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.280
<v Speaker 1>They don't with very real issues with one another as well as they are in a</v>

268
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:32.960
<v Speaker 1>turmoil,</v>

269
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but that time superheros from both companies,</v>

270
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>they were really one dimensional characters like captain America or or Superman.</v>

271
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that the audience responded really well to the fantastic four and</v>

272
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 1>this ended up becoming extremely successful.</v>

273
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Lovell's published a couldn't deny the number,</v>

274
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:52.940
<v Speaker 1>so they continue to make more issues despite the disapproval and lack of stamp</v>

275
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.910
<v Speaker 1>from the Comics Code Authority.</v>

276
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Once he was able to express his ideas within the pages of marvel comics,</v>

277
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Stan Lee discovered a new love of the industry.</v>

278
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>He began to create more characters like a man who he,</v>

279
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 1>based on himself as a teenager,</v>

280
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 1>each one of these characters was a direct reaction to the world around them.</v>

281
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.661
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

282
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the hope was written during the Cold War when people were afraid of nuclear</v>

283
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.640
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

284
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Iron man was a response to the hates for the military industrial complex and the</v>

285
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 1>x men where a social commentary on tolerance for people who are different from</v>

286
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

287
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.570
<v Speaker 1>In 1966 Stanley created black panther who was the world's first black superhero.</v>

288
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 1>He was revolutionizing to the industry and just about every single way during an</v>

289
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:33.071
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>

290
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Stanley said that the 1960s and seventies well,</v>

291
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>some of the best years of his entire career,</v>

292
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and again going on tours to universities around the United States.</v>

293
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.611
<v Speaker 1>By this point,</v>

294
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the children who grew up in the 1950s that we're told that comic books would</v>

295
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 1>corrupt they're impressionable minds,</v>

296
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 1>well embracing them once they reach their teens and that 20s young people,</v>

297
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>everyone looked up to Stanley.</v>

298
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 1>He gave lectures on story writing.</v>

299
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

300
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was gathering data around his fans and his off to every Q and a session.</v>

301
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He was writing down notes about ways that he could improve the marvel comic</v>

302
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:05.254
<v Speaker 1>storyline.</v>

303
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.710
<v Speaker 1>In the 1970s Stanley became the head publisher of Marvel.</v>

304
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You decided to hand over the responsibility of the scripts,</v>

305
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:19.350
<v Speaker 1>do other writers on the marvel team.</v>

306
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.090
<v Speaker 1>As he tried to take the superhero characters to California,</v>

307
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.560
<v Speaker 1>he convinced the executives at marvel comics to let him move his family out to</v>

308
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles and they opened up new offices,</v>

309
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>gold marvel productions on the west coast.</v>

310
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 1>It started the cartoon series of iron man is one called spider man and his</v>

311
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>amazing friends.</v>

312
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>In 1988 he became the head of marvel films and began to produce feature length</v>

313
00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:41.050
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

314
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>This ended up being a great business move because Spiderman,</v>

315
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 1>he soon became a household name.</v>

316
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately not everything that marvel studios produced was a success.</v>

317
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 1>They tried to create a show called the amazing Spiderman,</v>

318
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:52.450
<v Speaker 1>which add on cvs,</v>

319
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but Stanley,</v>

320
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was awful.</v>

321
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 1>He scheduled a meeting with cvs and tried to give some creative direction about</v>

322
00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.860
<v Speaker 1>how to make the story better,</v>

323
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 1>but they ignored his in Burton carried on doing it their way.</v>

324
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 1>They should have listened to his advice because the show was canceled after just</v>

325
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 1>four episodes.</v>

326
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood studios were having a hard time seeing the potential of these comic</v>

327
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:14.680
<v Speaker 1>book stories and didn't know how they put them on the big screen lease dated.</v>

328
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to explain the frustration.</v>

329
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 1>We had these characters and we knew how they should be portrayed and there were</v>

330
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>people who wanted to do them,</v>

331
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 1>but nothing really jelled.</v>

332
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 1>In 1997 the popularity of comic books drops dramatically.</v>

333
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Children were still watching the marvel animated series like x men on Saturday</v>

334
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:32.771
<v Speaker 1>mornings,</v>

335
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but the profits of the company went really downhill.</v>

336
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.410
<v Speaker 1>While it seems almost impossible to imagine this today,</v>

337
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>marvel comics actually had to file for bankruptcy.</v>

338
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:41.951
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully,</v>

339
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>even though the company was broke,</v>

340
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 1>they still maintained the copyright to all of their characters,</v>

341
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>which was a gold mine.</v>

342
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 1>During this time of uncertainty,</v>

343
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was approached by investors.</v>

344
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You suggested that he start a whole new company called Stanley media,</v>

345
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 1>which specialized in creating cartoons and comics that were streamed on the</v>

346
00:14:58.641 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

347
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>They started in 1999 and the venture became incredibly successful.</v>

348
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>They were able to hire over 200 people to work on that stuff.</v>

349
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

350
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 1>some of the executives were actually arrested for securities fraud.</v>

351
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>It turns out they had taken advantage of Stanley's name and his reputation for</v>

352
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>that own financial gain.</v>

353
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Stanley decided that the only way to avoid the scandal was to start his own</v>

354
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 1>company called POW entertainment.</v>

355
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>One of his most popular characters was stripped rela voiced by Pamela Anderson.</v>

356
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Eventually level was able to get back on their feet and they had Stanley under</v>

357
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 1>contract so that they could continue to get as creative guidance to make sure</v>

358
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 1>that the movies were done right.</v>

359
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.140
<v Speaker 1>After decades of dreaming of being on the big screen,</v>

360
00:15:40.141 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Stanley was finally about to appear in Hollywood blockbusters because he made</v>

361
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 1>sure that his contract included cameo roles in each new marvel movie that came</v>

362
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 1>out for the rest of his life.</v>

363
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Reassignments was not an option for Stanley.</v>

364
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.920
<v Speaker 1>He loved his job that much.</v>

365
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Martin Levy,</v>

366
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 1>he passed away on November the 12th 2018 and it was 95 years olds and lives</v>

367
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>every moment to the fullest with a sense of joy and enthusiasm.</v>

368
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Even if the man is gone,</v>

369
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 1>the legend of Stanley will live on forever as being one of the most influential</v>

370
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:13.790
<v Speaker 1>people in comic book history.</v>
