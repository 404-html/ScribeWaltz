6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.660
Nikita Khrushchev,

7
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:29.880
surname name is still enough to conjure images of flying missiles and nuclear

8
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.690
devastation.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.690
The Soviet premier who succeeded Stalin Khrushchev was a Russian bear of a man

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.630
and Olga who banged his shoe on a podium at the United Nations and told

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.540
Americans,
we will bury you.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.220
His rule in the 1950s and the 1960s coincide with the height of the red scare in

13
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.480
the u s since for a generation he was the West's ultimate boogeyman.

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.620
He was indeed the man who engineered the Cuban missile crisis that nearly ended

15
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.400
the world,

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.630
but there is much more to Khrushchev than Cuba and nuclear war.

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.550
The first peasant leader of the USSR,

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.750
he was a zealous reformer who tore down the buddy edifice of stolen aneurysm

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.820
under Khrushchev.
Swatch prisoners were freed,

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.380
communism was liberalized and life was improved for millions of people yeti

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.880
through all of this away with international theatrical that ultimately led to a

22
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:18.750
Soviet cool.

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
So was he the bad guy of the 20th century or was he just a misunderstood

24
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.910
reformat?
Well,
today we are diving into the life of the USSR,

25
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.830
the most controversial premiere,

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.220
although you would publicly identify with the Ukraine for most of his life.

27
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.870
Nikita Khrushchev was actually born in [inaudible] in Russia on April the 17th

28
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:47.430
1894 Chris Chefs family,
well,
the exact sort of people,
the communists idealized.

29
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.420
His father was a coal miner and his grandfather had been a surf who served in

30
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
the SARS army.

31
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.010
The only discordant note in this otherwise perfect proletarian upbringing was

32
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:57.960
the heavy presence of religion,

33
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.890
not the Khrushchev would have any problems ditching Christianity later in life

34
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.420
when he was just the land cruise ships,

35
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.630
parents moved across the border two years off and Ukraine,

36
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.790
which is now [inaudible],
it was in,

37
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.750
it was off cause grim industrial wasteland that Khrushchev finally found his

38
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:14.760
calling.
He got a job as a pipe fitter,

39
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:19.150
age 15 before becoming a skilled metal workup and his teenage hotter.

40
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.960
Dream it again,
some blue.

41
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.800
My dream of becoming an engineer runs a man of standing in Russian imperial

42
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:29.760
society.
Even married an educated woman who encouraged his ambition,

43
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.320
but this modest stream,
it was a balance to be swept away by a tsunami.

44
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560
On June the 28th 1914 a Serbian terrorist assassinated Austrian archduke Franz

45
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.240
Ferdinand in Sarajevo belly.
A month later,

46
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.290
the whole of the Russian empire was marching towards to protect Serbia from

47
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.840
Austrian retaliation and this has,

48
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:51.990
he might know mark at the beginning of World War One,

49
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.460
but while Chris jazz vital factory work,
he kept him from enlisting in the army.

50
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.640
He wouldn't be able to avoid what came next on march the eighth 1917 frustration

51
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.340
at nearly three years of badly run warfare.
It's exploded across Russia,

52
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.910
the February revolution.
So cool,

53
00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:11.200
cold because the Russian embassy still use the old Julian calendar,

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.460
topple the saw and place the empire in the hands of the provisional government

55
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.430
in Ukraine.
People,
they went nuts.
The saws.

56
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.130
Hated regime was gone and ordinary people,

57
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.800
they were in charge writing this heavyweight of optimism.

58
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.250
Khrushchev signed up with a new Bolshevik posse.
It was just in time.

59
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.480
On November the seventh of 1917 Vladimir Lenin engineered the October
Revolution,

60
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.030
the Bolsheviks storms,
the winter palace in Petrograd,

61
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.440
over through the provisional government and declared a socialist republic.

62
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.760
This was one of the biggest single events of the 20th century.
Ben's,

63
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.450
it had immediate consequences in Ukraine.
Civil war erupted.

64
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.920
It's pissing the red fortunes of Bolshevism against the white forces of the
sock.

65
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.330
It was couple of it further by uprisings of Ukrainian nationalists since later

66
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:56.950
an invasion by the Polish army.

67
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.400
Does that mean Steve presented as Dobson Republic Khrushchev in this and in the

68
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.120
Red Army in 1919 and he was sent to the Polish border for the next three years.

69
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.920
He fought the poles and the pro royalist whites until on October the 25th 1922

70
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.210
the Red Army finally declared victory that December the u s I saw it was

71
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:18.130
officially created back in what was now the Ukrainian Soviet socialist republic.

72
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.850
Khrushchev,
he demobilized,
but there was no time for celebration.

73
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.360
Just as the war ended.
Khrushchev's first wife,
she died.

74
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.290
Some sources say it was from famine,
brought about by the conflicts.

75
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.310
Others say that she contracted typhus left with two children to raise the now

76
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:34.061
adult Khrushchev.

77
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.660
He returned to his old alpha and enrolled in the Soviet work as school

78
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.610
determined to complete his education.

79
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.450
Much later it would be said that this more than the Ami is where Khrushchev

80
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.510
discovered his loyalty to the new regime under the saw,

81
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.160
a poor peasant from the Ukraine,

82
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.970
Russia border would have no chance of getting even a high school education.

83
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.620
Now the communists were in power.

84
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:58.000
Khrushchev was suddenly able to access a world of knowledge once reserved for

85
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.510
Russia's elite.
Perhaps that's why not long after he enrolled Khrushchev,

86
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.290
he took a major step one which would affect both his life and the lives of

87
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.090
everyone in the Ussr.

88
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.510
He became the leader of the zone because students communist party

89
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.520
Khrushchev's rise up the Soviet system.
It wasn't dramatic.

90
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.900
Rather than shoot to the top of the former presidents,
he rose slowly but surely.

91
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.890
It started with a promotion to the leader of the as African region Communist

92
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.040
Party.

93
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.340
Then there was reassignment to the biggest city of caucus then from that or it

94
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:36.341
was to a position at the top if the KF potty for man had been a pipe cleaner

95
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.210
just a decade before loading is over.

96
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:41.470
Metropolitan Kiev should have been enough that Khrushchev,

97
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.020
he wants it more than Ukraine was able to given.

98
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.650
In 1929 he went to Moscow provisional that to study metallurgy.
In reality,

99
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.080
it was to build a power base in no time at all.

100
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:55.010
Christian was put in charge of constructing the Moscow subway and incredibly

101
00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:56.120
important assignments.

102
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.690
He carried out his so well that the party maize in the communist equivalents of

103
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.270
the governor of Moscow by 1936 Khrushchev,

104
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.650
he was an influential rising star with a strong power base in both Moscow and

105
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:07.430
the Ukraine.

106
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.760
It's a description that should have seen him as one of the first to die in the

107
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:11.594
great purge.

108
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.580
Last thing from 1936 to 1938 the great purge was Stalin's unhinged killing spree

109
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.480
against anyone with a power base driver zone.

110
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.430
If you've seen our video on an KVD head of entry barrier,

111
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.570
you know know that even ultra loyalists like barrier nearly died in Stalin's

112
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.870
witch hunts by rights Christian story.

113
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.420
It should sort of end here with him being shot in the back and some of them

114
00:06:33.421 --> 00:06:38.210
anonymous Moscow courtyard on a chilly night that's Khrushchev had a quality

115
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:41.150
that no one else in the party hands during the great purge,

116
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.840
a quality that would save his life and that quality.

117
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.310
He was ridiculous.
Yeah,
far from being respected.
Khrushchev,

118
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.650
he was regarded as a total joke.

119
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.610
He was barely five foot two inches tall and he looks like some Ukrainian village

120
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.120
idiots.

121
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.540
He drank like a fish and started would sometimes make them do funny dances to

122
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.810
entertain on the party leaders.
It was this amazing combination.

123
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.350
While the vast majority of powerful communists were out being murdered,

124
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.560
Khrushchev was loudly supporting style in,

125
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:12.710
in public and acting as the Tyrons gesture in private as a results.

126
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.370
Khrushchev not only survived the great Paj,
but he benefited from it.

127
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.780
In 1938 he was made a member of the political bureau and elevated to the

128
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:24.110
position of leader of Ukraine.
Back in his old stomping ground.

129
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:27.800
Khrushchev kept cultivating his image of a stolen loyalist on the old bands

130
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:28.161
orders.

131
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:32.540
He oversaw all the bloody Soviet invasion of eastern Poland's before organizing

132
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:36.030
resistance to Hitler as 1941 invasion of the USSR.
It's cool.

133
00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:41.031
The next few years bloody would do a massive disservice to blood.

134
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.180
From 1941 June,

135
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.130
1944 the Nazis occupied Ukraine killing around 7 million people.

136
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.720
When Khrushchev regains control,

137
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:53.450
he conducted his own purge of German aligns Ukrainians.

138
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.510
This was then followed in 1946 by a famine that killed another million people.

139
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.930
It is this last catastrophe that started Khrushchev's slow drift from Stalin

140
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:03.410
aneurysm.

141
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.280
The famine was exacerbated by Soviet collective farming and grain quota.

142
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:10.040
Something which appalled Khrushchev,
who you have to remember,

143
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:12.620
he loved Ukraine like it was his homelands.

144
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.220
Not that his disillusionment would come into the open just quite yet.

145
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.120
In 1949 Chris Jeff was recalled to Moscow by stone and as part of the old man's

146
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:23.510
plans,
a balanced power and is in a circle alongside of entry barrier.

147
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.470
Deputy Prime Minister Nicholi Bulgan in and second body secretary,

148
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.560
Gorgon Mountain Golf,
Khrushchev became a fixture at Starland dacha.
Wow.

149
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.920
Once again,
the tire is made,
the this'll Ukrainian.

150
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.460
Dawn's is a funny little dance first,
Jeff,
the next few years,

151
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.250
and they were miserable away from his power base in Ukraine.

152
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.050
They in the part of court gesture Stalin,

153
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.780
he lives a life of low grade team in the Asian,

154
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.110
but something was about to happen that would shake up not just the lives of

155
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.330
Khrushchev Barrier Bogan and Amalin cove,

156
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.030
the lives of the entire communist world,

157
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.420
and that's because now it's time to discuss the death of Stalin.

158
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.170
<v 0>On march the first 1953 or seven tendered Stalin's bedroom to find the dictator</v>

160
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.650
lying unconscious in a pool of his own urine.
The man of steel,

161
00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.830
he had suffered a stroke,
although he would cling on for a few more days.

162
00:09:14.831 --> 00:09:17.920
It was the beginning of the end for styling aneurysm.
It was as as say,

163
00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:22.240
the beginning of the beginning for Khrushchev's rise to power at the moment of

164
00:09:22.241 --> 00:09:25.120
Stalin's death path to succession.
Well,

165
00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:29.440
it was Maria than the actual mud in terms of position.

166
00:09:29.441 --> 00:09:31.810
Georgia and melancholy,
I've had the best claim to the throne,

167
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.230
but the wily barrier had the power of these to propel himself to clear front

168
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:38.590
runner,
Chris Chef.
He was a seconds or maybe even a third tier choice,

169
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.060
even molars off who'd recently been on Stalin's kill list was seen as more

170
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:45.310
influential power,
very cat British chef.

171
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.180
He was also a man who was often underestimated and that allows him to move

172
00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:51.490
against the others before they realized what was happening.

173
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.120
Within nine days of Stalin's death,
Malin cough,
it had been sidelined.

174
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.260
Barrier assumes this mentored one and started enacting his own liberalizing

175
00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:03.280
reforms,
but in the shadows,
Khrushchev watched just biding his time.

176
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.310
When Barry has reformed this,
triggered a workers' revolts in east Germany.

177
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.020
He pounced on June the 26th 1953 Khrushchev denounced barrier in a closed

178
00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:14.650
meeting.
Nylon golf by now on Khrushchev's side called in the Red Army.

179
00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:17.950
Soldiers and barrier was shocked.
Debt in the Optima.

180
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.470
Khrushchev secured the poster,

181
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.650
First Secretary of the Communist Party with melancholic having the position of

182
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:28.120
premiere,
but it was clear who was really in charge.
Khrushchev's rule.

183
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.670
It started slowly.
These badges,

184
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.180
first year sidelining Malakov patching things up with starlings old enemy Tito

185
00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:37.510
in Yugoslavia and transferring Crimea to the Ukraine.

186
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.120
Something that would later cause problems,
as you're probably aware.

187
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.440
Then on February the 25th of 1956 Khrushchev abruptly changed gear,

188
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.340
the change.
It was a speech delivered before the 20th Party Congress.

189
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.090
It's known today as the secret speech because it was only ever meant to be heard

190
00:10:52.091 --> 00:10:53.260
by party officials,

191
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.850
but the reality was that someone had leaked it to the New York Times clocking in

192
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.140
at six hours.
The speech demolished Stalin's personality cults.

193
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.770
It criticized the dead leader for killing innocent communists during the great

194
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:10.690
purge and quoted a long suppressed letter written by Lenin advising that Stalin

195
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.600
never be given power to more than the as Khrushchev's speech.

196
00:11:13.601 --> 00:11:17.740
It actually seems pretty weak.
The only aspect of Stalin's rule does or attack.

197
00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:21.460
So the bits that directly affected law of Party members like Khrushchev,

198
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.140
not the campaigns of terror and the starvation that killed millions.

199
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:26.861
At the time,

200
00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:31.060
though it was a shocking as if Khrushchev had thrown a live grenade from the

201
00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:32.440
podium for two decades.

202
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:36.320
The party had been brainwashed into thinking that Stalin was the greatest world

203
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.030
leader rather than,

204
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.110
and now the big men success was telling them that starring was a tyrant.

205
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.930
This speech,
it triggered something called the Chris Jeff thought.

206
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.630
Over the next few years,
millions of political prisoners,

207
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.330
they were released and censorship which relaxed.

208
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.750
This was the start of a new era for the U S I saw,

209
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.420
although this brave new world would still be repressive,

210
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:59.950
it would be a utopia compared to how things were understanding.

211
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.270
There were some exceptions.

212
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.360
The news of the speech triggered a revolution in communist Hungary,

213
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:07.630
which crew should have crushed as brutally as Stalin would have.

214
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.510
On the other hand is when the speech also triggered an uprising and Poland's

215
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.140
Khrushchev flew to Warsaw and signed a deal of giving the independent communist

216
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.230
republics of eastern Europe previously unheard of autonomy,

217
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.060
whether the party likes it on us,

218
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.480
things they were changing from that and golf and molars of though the feeling

219
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:23.920
was very much not.

220
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.280
In June of 1957 they organized a coup to topple Khrushchev and return a

221
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.580
Stalinist system and it nearly worked.

222
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.480
I've worked in the political bureau actually passed to depose Khrushchev and it

223
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:38.440
was only guessing the hero of the Red Army Marshall Zuke of onsite that saved

224
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.700
Khrushchev but somebody if he did expanding mountain coven molars,

225
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.320
Alvin's even having his allies,

226
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:47.530
you called removed from power by March of 1958 there was no energy left in the

227
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.970
Stalinists.
Khrushchev became the undisputed leader of the USSR.

228
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.640
Now it was the only game in town.

229
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.220
Now just before we get into the USSR and decrease Jeff,

230
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:59.620
I do want to thank today's sponsor war thunder

231
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.090
once this like war thunder help us make these super long videos which with a

232
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:11.410
topic like this which is often demonetized,
it's you know,
it's helpful.

233
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.310
So if he wants all the fun of battle without you know the real death and horror

234
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:16.990
that you're hearing about in today's video,

235
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.180
you should absolutely check out war thunder.

236
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.170
It's a realistic free to play military vehicle combat game Wathen is available

237
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:28.171
on PC ps four Xbox one so if you've got any of those devices you're covered but

238
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.780
you only need one.
Only you need to do is just download and play the game.

239
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.890
It's free and they need to purchase and in this game there are over 1,200

240
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:40.891
historically accurate vehicles all the way from the 1920s to the 1990 so really

241
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:43.690
covering that time period you heard about in today's video,

242
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.530
they're all carefully built and incredibly detailed and all the physics has been

243
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.940
really sweated over.
So that's all very,
very good.
Sound as great as well.

244
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.630
Just go watch a trailer or maybe we'll play a bit of it now so you can get a

245
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:56.464
feel for that

246
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.050
and a,
you can just jump in,
play a quick arcade game,
which is useful.

247
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:24.100
You don't have much time or you could be realistic mode for a more challenging

248
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:27.790
tactical scenario or if you're hardcore,
I'm not,

249
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.970
I haven't blade simulator.
It's apparently very,
very difficult.

250
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:32.980
I didn't like getting my all swept over and over again,

251
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:35.290
but if you're really up for a challenge,
try that mode.

252
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.010
So join us on the battlefield for free.
Using the link below doing that.

253
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.420
Like I said,
it supports this show.

254
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:44.590
I guess you're a free premium tank or aircraft and three days of premium time as

255
00:14:44.591 --> 00:14:46.060
a bonus just for registering.

256
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.880
And let's get back to our story of the u s as saw and how it does.

257
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.380
How does the new leader shall we,

258
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.910
the next few years,
we're a dizzying time via average Soviet citizen.

259
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.970
If you imagine the USSR as a battered old car that's been puttering along under

260
00:15:12.221 --> 00:15:13.290
Stalin Khrushchev,

261
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:18.310
his rule was like watching a drunken madmen grabbed the wheel and go veering off

262
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:23.110
on a demanded and possibly dangerous new course for the first time.

263
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.620
Honest to God can seem a products.
They appeared on shelves in bookstores,

264
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.050
subversive literature.
It was suddenly available.

265
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.620
The shocking ghoulag chronicle one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich was

266
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.980
published with Khrushchev's personal blessing in the cities.

267
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.420
A wave of new apartment blocks gave people something resembling that own

268
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.550
personal space for the first time in years for on travel,

269
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.980
it was suddenly opens within the party.
Dozens.

270
00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:46.930
We're held accountable for their role in the purges,

271
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.320
although Khrushchev conveniently forgot to ask about his own involvement,

272
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.450
and 90 61 at Khrushchev even had stolen his body removed from Lennon's mausoleum

273
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.390
on Red Square.
That's same styling grants.
It was renamed vulgar grads.

274
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.140
It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.
Of course,
there was still a secret police.

275
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:03.940
They were still do lags.

276
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:07.750
There was still a repression as well as the USSR rafter role.

277
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.670
The difference was that repression and decrease.

278
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:14.050
Jeff was harassment and intimidation and paying endless bribes.

279
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.320
Whereas in time so many men that the secret police were shooting millions of

280
00:16:17.321 --> 00:16:20.860
people,
not that all of Khrushchev's reforms went well.
Vote.

281
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.120
In 1956 Khrushchev authorize the opening of a millions of acres of virgin land

282
00:16:25.121 --> 00:16:29.290
in Siberia and Kazakhstan's a farming in an attempt to and the sort of famines

283
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:30.700
that had witnessed in Ukraine.

284
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.270
This went about as well as you would expect when you send an untrained people to

285
00:16:34.271 --> 00:16:38.980
go and farm in Siberia.
It's pretty cold voice of the world though.
Khrushchev,

286
00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:40.120
he was a breath of fresh air.

287
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.990
He talked about living in peaceful coexistence with the West and assigned from

288
00:16:43.991 --> 00:16:46.630
the time he sell American reporters,
we will bury you.

289
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.700
He actually seemed to mean it in 1959 the USSR and the United States even hosted

290
00:16:51.701 --> 00:16:55.450
joint expos in their countries showing off Soviet living to the Americans and

291
00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:57.800
vice versa.
On July the 24th Khrushchev went,

292
00:16:57.801 --> 00:17:01.810
so it's all the American Expo in Moscow where he bumps into none other than

293
00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:02.860
Richard Nixon.

294
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.490
He stood before a model of an American kitchen and the two engaged in something

295
00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:08.200
known as the kitchen debate.

296
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.040
It was a semi light hearted Wang measuring contest between the two nations in

297
00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:15.940
the debates or Khrushchev and Nixon both argue why their system of government

298
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.900
was better.

299
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.120
<v 3>Okay,
but I can play
and the way you will dominate the conversation,</v>

300
00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:22.140
you would have made a good lawyer,

301
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.831
<v 0>Mark Khrushchev's,</v>

302
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:28.740
notorious 10 bird could have turned it into a diplomatic incidents.

303
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.360
It instead became a symbol for how the u s and the Soviet Union might be able to

304
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.410
agree to disagree.
That same year with relations seemingly warming,

305
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:42.411
Khrushchev left the USSR and embarked on a tour of the USA for those who grew up

306
00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:45.210
associating Chris Chefs name with the words missile crisis.

307
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.110
The image of the Russian Baron,
Iowa munching on hotdogs and chatting,

308
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.730
thanks and not true,
can seem almost comically strange yet.

309
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.540
History is sometimes pretty strange.
Khrushchev's tour of America,

310
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.920
the first by Soviet leader,

311
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.760
it was a media sensation or they're anti nuclear talks with Eisenhower went

312
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:03.420
nowhere.

313
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.420
The trip was mostly deems a PR success as 1960 dawn did even began to seem as if

314
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:11.550
the two supervisors,
they went destined to a not have they wanted all that.

315
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.990
It seems that the might be ringing the world's for communism and capitalism to

316
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.260
coexist.
Eh,
if anyone really did that though,

317
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:22.110
while they were about to get a fairly rude awakening

318
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.090
on our type of the fourth 1957 the u s I saw Sputnik one blast blasted off from

319
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.630
the plains of Kazakhstan becoming the first manmade satellite in orbit,

320
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.980
not four years later on April the 12th 1961 a Soviet rocket carries another

321
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.660
first into Orbitz.
This done.
It was a man named Yuri Gagarin.
On that day,

322
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.490
he became the first ever human to experience space flight for Soviet citizens.

323
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:54.660
These two phenomenal achievements were just yet more good news from the Chris

324
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:58.890
Jeff Thor over in the Pentagon though the American position,
it was one a watery.

325
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.860
It wasn't just because of the Soviets who making NASA leg like Hicks,

326
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:05.790
but also because those rockets were capable of delivering something much more

327
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:09.450
serious than cosmonauts and that was a course nuclear weapons.

328
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:14.250
These fears crystallized on to type of the 14th 1962 and I'm saying American spy

329
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:17.690
plane passing over the Cuba snapped a rather strange picture.

330
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.380
The previous couple of years had been Raul,

331
00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:22.470
the strains between the United States and it's either neighbor.

332
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.610
In 1959 Fidel Castro comes to power on the back of a communist revolution,

333
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.660
not two years later,

334
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:31.890
the new JFK administration to try to invade the island and toppled Castro

335
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.300
resulting in an enormous grub that you've probably heard of called the Bay of

336
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.630
Pigs.
On top of that,
and relations had gone rather south with the USSR.

337
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.290
Khrushchev had reacted angrily to the Bay of Pigs and there was this image of

338
00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:47.580
him banging his shoe on the table at the UN in 1960 that convinced the Americans

339
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:52.050
that he was a bit unstable as the spy plane pilot snapped his pictures and flew

340
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:54.360
away from that warm Caribbean Day.

341
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:59.340
He had no way of knowing that his images would soon lead the planet to the brink

342
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.630
of nuclear war.

343
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.200
The pictures showed a Soviet nuclear launch pad being construction in Cuba.

344
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.730
Apocalyptic missiles when now station just 19 miles from the u s mainland's.

345
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.030
When the news reached Washington,
the worlds it entered crisis mode,

346
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.840
Khrushchev's whole rationale was that the u s it installed it's own missiles in

347
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:20.760
Tuckey,
even closer to the USSR and the Cuban missiles went to America.

348
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.060
Surely the Americans would just have to learn to deal with it,

349
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.810
but the thought of an atomic bomb exploding over Miami or Houston at forced

350
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.510
Americans to hit back on the 22nd of October,

351
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.140
Jfk gave a televised address informing the wells about the missiles.

352
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.340
He punched a set off a naval blockade to stop more missiles reaching Cuba and

353
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.590
gave the u s s saw an ultimatum,

354
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.760
remove the missiles in Cuba or it's war in the Kremlin and Khrushchev,

355
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.900
he tried to hold us enough.

356
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.180
The USSR was already failing at the nuclear arms race.

357
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.600
If it lost its new outpost in Cuba,
who knew what would happen.

358
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.780
And thus began the highest stakes game of chicken and history.

359
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.200
On October the 24th Soviet ships carrying additional missiles reached the u s

360
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.670
naval blockade,
the two sides where one mistake from new PIA war,

361
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.270
three days later a US pilots was shot down over Cuba with tensions.

362
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:11.170
Now breaking points,

363
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:14.680
people across the planet again to prepare for the ends as any moments of the

364
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:18.490
human race could be snuffed out in a flash of atomic light.

365
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.910
The fact that it wasn't is simply do you to two pieces of paper on October the

366
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:26.950
28th 1960 to Khrushchev cracks.

367
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.440
He sent JFK to agenda notes.

368
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.470
The first said the Cuban nuclear facilities would be dismantled if the u s swore

369
00:21:33.471 --> 00:21:35.230
to never launched another invasion of Cuba.

370
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.460
There's acan demanded that the u s nuclear missiles also be removed from tocky

371
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.850
hold.
Like the Kennedy Administration only publicly agreed to the first note.

372
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.630
They secretly let Moscow know that that abide by the second as well.

373
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.320
I'm just like that the weld snapped back from the abyss.

374
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.340
So what was going through Christian,
his mind as he sent those notes,

375
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.260
the American version has it that the crisis was simply a high stakes poker game

376
00:21:58.261 --> 00:22:00.540
and the USSR linked fussed,

377
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.520
but maybe there was something more hand for all of his faults.

378
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:06.760
Khrushchev wasn't a psychopath.
He didn't want to destroy the world.

379
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.940
It was certainly his fault that the missile is in Cuba in the first place,

380
00:22:09.941 --> 00:22:14.190
but maybe he also deserves credit for not seeing his dangerous bluff through.

381
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.990
Regardless,
the crisis ended without the planet burning.

382
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.750
The Soviets retreated and the Americans,
they kept their promises.

383
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.030
The next year a hotline was installed between the White House and the creme.

384
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.770
Lindsey prevent future apocalypses and his ladies and memoirs Khrushchev would

385
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:28.510
like to call the resolution to the crisis,

386
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.280
a personal triumph bus that were very few in Moscow who saw that way from the

387
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:35.890
moment that a u s biplane first took that photo ever.
Cuba,

388
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.380
his days in the Kremlin,
they were numbered.

389
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.640
The ripple effects of the Cuban missile crisis were felt across the globe in

390
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:49.030
Asia.

391
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.510
They became the final nail in the coffin for the relationship between the USSR

392
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:54.540
and China.
The Sino Soviet splits.

393
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.310
It began way back with Khrushchev's secret speech.
This,

394
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.120
it was the bungled missile crisis that convinced mau to break with Moscow

395
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.250
fingers.
Actually even go Chris,
Jeff,

396
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.130
the Foun in the structures of the communist party,

397
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:08.470
the perceived humiliation of Christian has climbed down,

398
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.430
made people question the leader in ways that they hadn't since Malin govs failed

399
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:13.120
coup.

400
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.100
Brad's all these reforms that gums Chris Jeff's had perhaps what the u s is on

401
00:23:17.101 --> 00:23:19.840
needed was less liberalism and its more orthodoxy.

402
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.970
I mean they didn't want to go all the way back to stolen ism,

403
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:26.110
but you know maybe something just slightly less open and less tolerance.

404
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.730
And so Leonid Brezhnev,
a protege of Khrushchev and the fellow Ukrainian,

405
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:33.190
although in Reggie natives case had actually been born.

406
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.070
That native was also a deeply ambitious man.

407
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.750
Although Khrushchev was clearly grooming him to be a success,
a relative,

408
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.490
you didn't want to wait.
And now with the tide of opinion.

409
00:23:42.491 --> 00:23:46.250
Finally turning against Khrushchev,
the pupil,
you can tunnel that small stock.

410
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.080
On October the 14th 1964 Khrushchev was on vacation in Georgia when Reggie never

411
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:51.920
launched as queue.

412
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.820
While every previous Soviet handover of power had been accompanied by bloodshed

413
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.070
this time things were almost orderly.

414
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.700
Restaurant of took control of the party audit Christian back to Moscow wins,

415
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.270
made them resign as a leader.
Why isn't he Khrushchev?

416
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.210
He accepted this early retirement and that was it for cruise chef,

417
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.270
the man who destocked and NYSED an MPI.
He was allowed to live,

418
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:14.360
but it was shunted off into anonymity.
Khrushchev,

419
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.030
he was forbidden from speaking aos.

420
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.000
The press were encouraged not to report on him and his name was quietly scrubbed

421
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.300
from Soviet life,
although bridge and didn't kill his old mentor,

422
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:24.320
how we felt about him,

423
00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:27.830
his evidence from what happens when Khrushchev finally died on September the

424
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:32.170
11th 1971 while on his policy made headlines in the west,
the Soviet press,

425
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.410
they didn't mention it for 48 hours before finally putting out a small notice,

426
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.910
there was no state funeral.

427
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.600
There was no burial in the Kremlin wool less than a decade off to his left

428
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:45.500
office.
It seemed Khrushchev had already been forgotten,
but Khrushchev,

429
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.510
he wasn't done yet.
Over a decade after his death,

430
00:24:48.511 --> 00:24:50.060
the group of younger communists,

431
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:53.120
they came to power known as the children of the 20th Party Congress.

432
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:57.200
They were the generation of party members who watched enraptured is Khrushchev

433
00:24:57.201 --> 00:24:59.960
made his secret speech.
One of them,
well,

434
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:04.430
that was Mikhail Gorbachev and the late 1980s Gorbachev would implement his own

435
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:08.270
version of Khrushchev's reforms known as glasnost and Perestroika that

436
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:10.610
eventually lead to the USSR as disillusion,

437
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.180
nor was Gorbachev the only communist leader that Khrushchev influenced the

438
00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:14.601
crease.
You have.

439
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:19.250
Thor had been credited with inspiring everything from the Prague spring in 1968

440
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:23.660
to dang shall opening of the Chinese markets in the 1980s almost every

441
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:27.620
liberalizing strain of communism.
It can be traced back to the secret speech.

442
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.430
So at the ends of all of that,
once the historical verdict on the crease,
Jeff,

443
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.500
as we said at the start,
for many in the west,

444
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.340
it's the missile crisis so that suddenly that was a huge part of its premise

445
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.990
ship.
There was more than that.

446
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.040
Khrushchev was the first Soviet premiere to stop the mass killings to end the

447
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.800
daily terror of life.
Understanding.
Sure,

448
00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:48.620
the society he led was still woefully repressive,

449
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.210
but it was an improvements by orders of magnitude from the one that had come

450
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:56.720
before him in another timeline without Khrushchev fields have one of the

451
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:59.320
Stalinist seizing controlled in 1953 ends,

452
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.240
you'll have many more decades of unbridled mass Smeta.

453
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.260
You'd never have the thought,
you'd never have the stylization Jeff.

454
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.640
He may have had his faults,

455
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:11.000
but in many ways he was also the right man at the right time.

456
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.910
History may judge them harshly for his mistakes,

457
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.140
but it shouldn't forget his successes.
