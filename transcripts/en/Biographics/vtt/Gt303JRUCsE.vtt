<v Speaker 1>You'll also find a link in the description below.</v>

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>He was America's first and most celebrated western anti hero.</v>

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>It was claimed that he kills 21 men,</v>

8
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>one for every year of his young life,</v>

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>and the press portrayed him as a ruthless,</v>

10
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>psychotic wild.</v>

11
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:24.374
<v Speaker 1>I kill it.</v>

12
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>The reality was that billy,</v>

13
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>the kid,</v>

14
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>was none of these things.</v>

15
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean this week's biographics,</v>

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>we go in such of the real early,</v>

17
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>there is uncertainty as to the birthplace of the child who would become a</v>

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>believer kit.</v>

19
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Most historians believe that was the slums of New York City,</v>

20
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>and the year was 18,</v>

21
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:52.814
<v Speaker 1>59.</v>

22
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>His birth name was Henry Mccarty and he was the son of Irish immigrants who had</v>

23
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>come to America to escape the devastating effects of the Irish potato famine.</v>

24
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>His mother's name was Katherine,</v>

25
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>but we know nothing about his father except that he died when Henry was an</v>

26
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>infant.</v>

27
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>When Henry was around six and his mother joins the post civil war exodus,</v>

28
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:13.700
<v Speaker 1>do the West in such.</v>

29
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>If the batter life that had so far alluded them in the new world,</v>

30
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>they drained a wagon train and undertook the arduous journey over the Oregon</v>

31
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>trail.</v>

32
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>They go as far as Indianapolis,</v>

33
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Indiana,</v>

34
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

35
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Karen and Matt had married a man by the name of William Harrison.</v>

36
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Trim and trim had dreams of striking it rich in the gold mines to the southwest.</v>

37
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
<v Speaker 1>And soon the makeshift family had relocated to silver city,</v>

38
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.034
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico,</v>

39
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.570
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico in the early eighties,</v>

40
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>seventies was like a foreign country to immigrants from the east.</v>

41
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It was mainly peoples by Mexicans and native Americans.</v>

42
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>The entire culture and religion was very different to what most Americans were</v>

43
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>used to.</v>

44
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.121
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

45
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and Navajo were more likely to be spoken in English.</v>

46
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>And most houses were maces carved into the sides of rock formations.</v>

47
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>In this Hodgepodge of cultures,</v>

48
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>violence was commonplace.</v>

49
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>What many newcomers from the east would have recoiled at such an environment,</v>

50
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:05.301
<v Speaker 1>a young,</v>

51
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Henry Annacarty.</v>

53
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>He embraced it,</v>

54
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 1>immersed himself in the Mexican culture,</v>

55
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>spending most of his time in the Hispanic part of town.</v>

56
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was a teenager,</v>

57
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>he could speak fluent Spanish and could even pass for native Mexican with</v>

58
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Sombrero and pawn shape.</v>

59
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Whenever that was a public Mexican social events,</v>

60
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Henry would be that often with his mother.</v>

61
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>The two would dance,</v>

62
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>the fandango together and talk easily with the Mexican elders.</v>

63
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most of the Europeans in town,</v>

64
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Henry showed respect to the locals exhibiting a formal politeness to the older</v>

65
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:36.560
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

66
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>which one have a lot of praise.</v>

67
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>He was remembered by the Hispanic community,</v>

68
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>is a charming boy who was always happy.</v>

69
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>The humor was cruelly snatched from Henry's life when at the age of 15,</v>

70
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>he suffered the loss of his mother.</v>

71
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Katherine had been suffering from tuberculosis for some time and it was hoped</v>

72
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>that the dry air of New Mexico would say condition,</v>

73
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't to be.</v>

74
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Catherine died in 1874,</v>

75
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>believing henry and the possession of his stepfather,</v>

76
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>William Antrim.</v>

77
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Andrew,</v>

78
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

79
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>had no intention of being tied down with a teenage.</v>

80
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Boys look after he promptly abandoned 10 read,</v>

81
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.360
<v Speaker 1>leaving town,</v>

82
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and more fertile gold diggings,</v>

83
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>so with the age of 15,</v>

84
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Henry was left on his own to fend for himself in a dangerous frontier town.</v>

85
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Henry now had to live off his wits.</v>

86
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>He spends his time hanging around the saloons and prostitutes on the cds sign of</v>

87
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

88
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in back alleys and boarding houses and running errands to pay his way.</v>

89
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>He soon became involved in minor criminal activity and meeting up with a hoodlum</v>

90
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>by the name of some railroad.</v>

91
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Jack Henry was recruited as a lookout.</v>

92
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.761
<v Speaker 1>Well Jack,</v>

93
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Rob's local businesses.</v>

94
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>One of them was the local Chinese laundry.</v>

95
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart when a loaded revolver,</v>

96
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.070
<v Speaker 1>that jacket sterling from the laundry,</v>

97
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>was found in Henry's possession.</v>

98
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Boy was arrested and thrown into the local jail.</v>

99
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>It was while sitting in that tiny jail salvage Henry made a fateful decision.</v>

100
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>He could have sat and waited for the circuit judge to come to town and try his</v>

101
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:12.751
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

102
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but that may have taken months.</v>

103
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

104
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.470
<v Speaker 1>he decided to escape.</v>

105
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>In doing so,</v>

106
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>he honed the skill that would serve him to good effect.</v>

107
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Many times over the next five years that was getting people to underestimate his</v>

108
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:24.804
<v Speaker 1>abilities,</v>

109
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>henry talked his God into allowing him to come out of his cell for a short</v>

110
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>period in order to stretch his legs.</v>

111
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>He was still confined to the jail house and the door to the outside world was</v>

112
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 1>security knocks,</v>

113
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but that was also a chimney.</v>

114
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Why does God was out of the room and we've managed to squeeze this slight frame</v>

115
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.801
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

116
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the suit covered escape hole and onto the roof and then into the town plaza.</v>

117
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 1>By the time it was discovered that he had escaped,</v>

118
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:52.011
<v Speaker 1>he was free of silver city and en route to Arizona carrying no food supplies and</v>

119
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.221
<v Speaker 1>without a horse.</v>

120
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Henry displayed an incredible physical and mental strength in crossing the</v>

121
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>desert plains of the southwest.</v>

122
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>He quickly learns that Hampton live off the land,</v>

123
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 1>is foraging where he could and steaming wearing must.</v>

124
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The 16 year old wanted fugitive,</v>

125
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>made it across 500 miles of desert before stumbling into a remote army outpost</v>

126
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 1>in eastern Arizona.</v>

127
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Gold Camp grads here,</v>

128
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.990
<v Speaker 1>he managed to find employment as a cook on a local ranch after hours.</v>

129
00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:22.470
<v Speaker 1>He drifted to the local town where he took the gambling and hustling in the</v>

130
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:23.220
<v Speaker 1>saloons,</v>

131
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.030
<v Speaker 1>the men and he was now associated with included some hardened criminals and they</v>

132
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:28.710
<v Speaker 1>quickly showed him the ropes.</v>

133
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Before long,</v>

134
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>he was participating in stealing horses</v>

135
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 1>outside of his ranch duties and isn't nefarious nighttime activities.</v>

136
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:42.601
<v Speaker 1>Young Henry,</v>

137
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>it founds the time to perfect his skills with a firearm.</v>

138
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>He had managed to buy a revolver and quickly discovered an innate ability to</v>

139
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>wield it.</v>

140
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>With this skill came instant respect for those around him.</v>

141
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Within a year of escaping the jail cell in silver city,</v>

142
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Henry had developed into a character of note among the thugs in the Arizona</v>

143
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

144
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>He wore a brightly colored scarf around his neck and walks with the self</v>

145
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>assuredness of a man many years older than his only 17 years,</v>

146
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>and it was at this time that people will begin to call him the kid.</v>

147
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It was August the 17th,</v>

148
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.320
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

149
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>77 when the kid went from small time crook to hardened killer.</v>

150
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>The local blacksmith was a bully by the name of Frank k hill on that nice while</v>

151
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.280
<v Speaker 1>drinking in a saloon.</v>

152
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Cahill had his sights set on Henry and he was throwing insults at the kid when</v>

153
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>the kid called him a son of a bitch.</v>

154
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>He'll jumped him and proceeded to pounds him on the saloon floor.</v>

156
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Pins underneath the bigger man.</v>

157
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 1>The kid managed to free his six shooter.</v>

158
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>He shows cahill in the stomach and then quickly it slid out from under him</v>

159
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>leaving the blacksmith to die.</v>

160
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>He hightailed it out of town on a stone and horse and headed back to New Mexico.</v>

161
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Now I wanted fugitive for the crime of murder.</v>

162
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>The kid changed his name to William h dot Bonnie.</v>

163
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>He wandered across the vast open spaces relying on the hospitality of Hispanic</v>

164
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>ranches to provide him with a meal or a place to lay his head.</v>

165
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

166
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.980
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico was being targeted by big shot land speculators from back east.</v>

167
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>They sold the mostly barren territory,</v>

168
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 1>is a golden opportunity for speculation,</v>

169
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.840
<v Speaker 1>and they began buying up land parcels from Hispanic settlers,</v>

170
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>usually prices that were manifestly unfair to the seller.</v>

171
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Those who didn't want to sell that lands like they were going to find themselves</v>

172
00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:28.050
<v Speaker 1>facing fondant prosecution.</v>

173
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Soon the eastern entrepreneurs had wrested control of every industry in the</v>

174
00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:34.830
<v Speaker 1>state from mining to the castle industry,</v>

175
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and even the railroads.</v>

176
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.030
<v Speaker 1>The largest county in New Mexico was Lincoln,</v>

177
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.940
<v Speaker 1>which covered nearly a fifth of the entire territory.</v>

178
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It was there in 18,</v>

179
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>78.</v>

180
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a war broke out that would have a profound effect on the remaining years</v>

181
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.890
<v Speaker 1>of beneath the kid's life.</v>

182
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.360
<v Speaker 1>In the late 18 sixties,</v>

183
00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:55.500
<v Speaker 1>a couple of Irish immigrants by the names of Lawrence Mathy and James Dolan has</v>

184
00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.450
<v Speaker 1>bought up the majority of Lincoln County and turned it into a huge cattle ranch.</v>

185
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.830
<v Speaker 1>They had secured extremely large military contracts to supply beef to fort</v>

186
00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:06.960
<v Speaker 1>stands in the Murphy Dolan monopoly,</v>

187
00:08:06.961 --> 00:08:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and Lincoln County was called the house and it was fiercely protected by battens</v>

188
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.280
<v Speaker 1>of thugs known as the seven rivers gang.</v>

189
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 1>They operated from a huge wooden building in the middle of the Lincoln township</v>

190
00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and controlled every business in town in 18,</v>

191
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:21.481
<v Speaker 1>77,</v>

192
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:25.620
<v Speaker 1>the house monopoly over Lincoln County was challenged first in court and then on</v>

193
00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>the range by a Scottish born local attorney by the name of Alexander Mcswain,</v>

194
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>teaming up with a lie.</v>

195
00:08:31.251 --> 00:08:32.520
<v Speaker 1>It was a 23 year old,</v>

196
00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>recently arrived at British actress by the name of John Turn,</v>

197
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>stall with a seemingly unending supply of funds to the store,</v>

198
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:43.440
<v Speaker 1>was intent on creating his own castle empire in the county.</v>

199
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 1>In this quest,</v>

200
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>he enjoyed the support of the most successful and famous cattle baron in the</v>

201
00:08:48.751 --> 00:08:49.680
<v Speaker 1>entire country.</v>

202
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.390
<v Speaker 1>John Chism tunstall began to recruit employees not only to work the council,</v>

203
00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>but also the protection that he knew would be needed when he came up against the</v>

204
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

205
00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.570
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>

206
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Bonnie?</v>

207
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 1>In Lincoln County in mid 18,</v>

208
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>77 and immediately proceeded to do what he did best and that was steal horses in</v>

209
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>short order.</v>

210
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>He was caught and thrown in jail.</v>

211
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>It just so happens that the man he had been wrestling horses from.</v>

212
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:13.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

213
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:17.380
<v Speaker 1>that was John Tunstall when the Englishman confronted the teenage outlaw and</v>

214
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 1>they declined to press charges and steady off of the kid a job as a member of</v>

215
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:21.961
<v Speaker 1>the regulators,</v>

216
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>the team of cowboys,</v>

217
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that whereas protection squad,</v>

218
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>billy,</v>

219
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>he grabbed this off,</v>

220
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

221
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>with both hands in Johnstown stole.</v>

222
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>He had found a man who would give them a fair break.</v>

223
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.981
<v Speaker 1>He said this,</v>

224
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:33.530
<v Speaker 1>if his employer Tom Stole,</v>

225
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>was the only man who treated me like I was decent on white.</v>

226
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 1>The kid joins a group of men will older than him as he learns the work of a</v>

227
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>cowboy.</v>

228
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It was a long,</v>

229
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>arduous,</v>

230
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 1>often backbreaking work and they slept sounds with the castle on the range for</v>

231
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>the Betas of the house,</v>

232
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Muffy and,</v>

233
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of an upper crust Englishman moving in on that territory was</v>

234
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 1>thinkable like the kid's parents that escape the famine back in Ireland and</v>

235
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>deeply resented the English over their unwillingness to provide relief.</v>

236
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.201
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

237
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 1>having found that new life in the new world where they again to be plagued by</v>

238
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:07.420
<v Speaker 1>the power and the money of the English well,</v>

239
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>that's something that they would never allow to happen.</v>

240
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Nothing and Dolan's power extended to control of the legal system that Lincoln</v>

241
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 1>county operated under.</v>

242
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>They enlisted the aid of William Brady,</v>

243
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the corrupt sheriff,</v>

244
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.430
<v Speaker 1>to enforce a fake court order that confiscated all of the horses and cattle on</v>

245
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>the ranch.</v>

246
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.430
<v Speaker 1>When tunstall received the demands,</v>

247
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was some kind of mistake and proceeded to ride into town in order</v>

248
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:31.700
<v Speaker 1>to sort things out on the way there,</v>

249
00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and he was met by the sheriff and a policy of men on their way to execute the</v>

250
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:36.714
<v Speaker 1>court order.</v>

251
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Still thinking he could reason with the Lumen to install road towards the</v>

252
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>sheriff.</v>

253
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 1>But before he got twice members of the policy,</v>

254
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.333
<v Speaker 1>they shot him dead.</v>

255
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 1>To add insult to injury,</v>

256
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they shot his horse to install.</v>

257
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 1>His body was soon found by the men who worked for him and taken back to his</v>

258
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 1>ranch for burial.</v>

259
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Billy was incensed at the cold blooded assassination of his boss and he,</v>

260
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>along with a group of hardcore other employees,</v>

261
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>made a pact of vengeance against the house.</v>

262
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>They made it to the top of which was the sheriff of Lincoln County.</v>

263
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 1>William Brady Brady's ends came on April fool's day.</v>

264
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.630
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

265
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 1>78 says he was taking his morning stroll through Lincoln.</v>

266
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Billy and his fellow regulators were lying in ambush and poured more than a</v>

267
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>dozen bullets into his body during the gunfight that ensued with Brady's</v>

268
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>deputies.</v>

269
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Billy was shot in the thigh three days later.</v>

270
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:25.970
<v Speaker 1>A shootout occurred.</v>

271
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>It blazes mill this time to have the regulators were killed as a result of the</v>

272
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>two incidents,</v>

273
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 1>several murder warrants were issued including one for billy.</v>

274
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>The conflicts came to a head when Alexander Mcqueen road from the ton store</v>

275
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 1>ranch with between 50 and 60 regulators on July the 14th,</v>

276
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:42.481
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

277
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>68.</v>

278
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Some of the men's strategically positioned themselves between buildings and on</v>

279
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 1>rooftops while others including billy,</v>

280
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>set themselves up in a house that belonged to McSweeney for the next two days.</v>

281
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>They waited on July the 16th.</v>

282
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.630
<v Speaker 1>The new sheriff George happens,</v>

283
00:11:56.631 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 1>send some men to kill the regular agency were stationed on the roof of the</v>

284
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>saloon after one of them,</v>

285
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>but was killed.</v>

286
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>These men were forced to retreat.</v>

287
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Heaven.</v>

288
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Now send a message to fort stands in requesting military assistance.</v>

289
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 1>The request was initially turned down,</v>

290
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>but the military bras changed their mind the next day with that Nathan Dudley</v>

291
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:17.620
<v Speaker 1>road into town at the head of a troop of soldiers,</v>

292
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 1>a standoff in sued for a couple more days.</v>

293
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Then on Friday,</v>

294
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:21.821
<v Speaker 1>July,</v>

295
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:22.654
<v Speaker 1>the 19th,</v>

296
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 1>all hell broke loose.</v>

297
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The regulators were now all hold up in the house.</v>

298
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 1>A massive barrage of firepower was unleashed on this house with return fire</v>

299
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>coming just as fiercely.</v>

300
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Then the house was set on fire and then attempts to escape.</v>

301
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Mcswain was shot dead that he managed to kill the man who had felled</v>

302
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>mcswain before making good on his own escape along with the other regulators.</v>

303
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:44.951
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

304
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 1>just before we get into the rest of billy's life,</v>

305
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I do want to take a moment to thank the people who make this video possible and</v>

306
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>that will be brilliant.</v>

307
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I know mid rollout is not great for the story here,</v>

308
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but these videos are long,</v>

309
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 1>so I do hope you appreciate our needs to have sponsors to make them possible.</v>

310
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.021
<v Speaker 1>Brilliance.</v>

311
00:12:59.021 --> 00:12:59.831
<v Speaker 1>Our lending platform,</v>

312
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>which teaches three something called active learning,</v>

313
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.250
<v Speaker 1>unlike biographies,</v>

314
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 1>which has done a nice way to learn about people's lives,</v>

315
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 1>learning about science.</v>

316
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.563
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit trickier.</v>

317
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever had to sit down with a science textbook.</v>

318
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I have and I read them in a whole lot of stuff.</v>

319
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.354
<v Speaker 1>That makes me think,</v>

320
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.530
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second and then you ended up reading the page six times over and</v>

321
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you're still not taking it in.</v>

322
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:18.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:19.391
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

324
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Solves that problem with active learning,</v>

325
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.031
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

326
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Giving you something super short to read.</v>

327
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy and then you immediately apply it to a problem.</v>

328
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 1>The rinse and repeat that and suddenly or understanding or sorts of stuff that</v>

329
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you really didn't think you'd be able to.</v>

330
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.431
<v Speaker 1>I've been using.</v>

331
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant and you should just go try it.</v>

332
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Just to see how easy it is to suddenly be understanding all of these complex</v>

333
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:39.311
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>

334
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really brilliant.</v>

335
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Just make them super easy to grasp.</v>

336
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>You can support biographics by going to brilliant.org forward slash biographics,</v>

337
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 1>and now let's get back to the kid.</v>

338
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Bye now developed into a seasoned killer.</v>

339
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.200
<v Speaker 1>He was now wanted for multiple counts of murder in different jurisdictions.</v>

340
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

341
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.700
<v Speaker 1>he was able to find refuge with the Hispanic sheepherders who viewed him as a</v>

342
00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:09.090
<v Speaker 1>fighter for their liberty against the Anglo robber barons.</v>

343
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.110
<v Speaker 1>The firestorm that had erupted in the heart of Lincoln County forced authorities</v>

344
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:16.980
<v Speaker 1>to act in diamonds were issued for the arrest of billion to other regulators for</v>

345
00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>the murder of sheriff braiding.</v>

346
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I knew governor of New Mexico territory was also appointed the man given the job</v>

347
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.000
<v Speaker 1>was new wallace,</v>

348
00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:24.900
<v Speaker 1>a format union,</v>

349
00:14:24.901 --> 00:14:28.040
<v Speaker 1>army general and future author of the Book Ben Hart,</v>

350
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Wallace that Alpha Lincoln County with direct instructions from President</v>

351
00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Rutherford b Hayes to restore order.</v>

352
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.620
<v Speaker 1>But while it's encountered a population who were too terrifying to get involved</v>

353
00:14:37.621 --> 00:14:40.920
<v Speaker 1>in so was unable to secure any witness testimonies as to what had been</v>

354
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:41.754
<v Speaker 1>occurring,</v>

355
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.310
<v Speaker 1>that he received a letter from a man calling himself,</v>

356
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.180
<v Speaker 1>William H,</v>

357
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Bonnie.</v>

358
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.680
<v Speaker 1>The kids offered to testify against the members of the house in return for</v>

359
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>philanthropists and swallows,</v>

360
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.003
<v Speaker 1>agreed,</v>

361
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

362
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>testified before a grand jury with his testimony leading do indictments against</v>

363
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:59.400
<v Speaker 1>a number of house members including leader James Donut,</v>

364
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't lived up to his side of the deal,</v>

365
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately the governor did not live up to his skipping town before the</v>

366
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:06.951
<v Speaker 1>amnesty.</v>

367
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:07.910
<v Speaker 1>You could be formalized</v>

368
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.090
<v Speaker 1>with the governor gone.</v>

369
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Most of the indictments against the house members,</v>

370
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 1>they would drops,</v>

371
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but those against the regulators,</v>

372
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.813
<v Speaker 1>they remained,</v>

373
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.920
<v Speaker 1>believe fled town before he could be arrested.</v>

374
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.470
<v Speaker 1>While the other regulars fled in New Mexico territory,</v>

375
00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:29.940
<v Speaker 1>billy decided to stay put and you can also living as a council on Horse Rustler</v>

376
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.000
<v Speaker 1>over the next few months.</v>

377
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:32.580
<v Speaker 1>See arrestee ranches.</v>

378
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.020
<v Speaker 1>If the house empire and the process becoming the most wanted man in New Mexico,</v>

379
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.370
<v Speaker 1>the newspapers of New Mexico,</v>

380
00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:40.680
<v Speaker 1>most of which were simply mouthpieces for the house,</v>

381
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.640
<v Speaker 1>demonized the blaming him for every misdeed in the territory in 18,</v>

382
00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:44.971
<v Speaker 1>80,</v>

383
00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:46.200
<v Speaker 1>the editor of the Las Vegas,</v>

384
00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 1>because that first names the outlawed,</v>

385
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>believe the kids,</v>

386
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.430
<v Speaker 1>the name for which he would forever.</v>

387
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.343
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

388
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 1>by the summer of 18,</v>

389
00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.120
<v Speaker 1>80 though,</v>

390
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 1>he still rooms the territory.</v>

391
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Billy had made a base for himself at Fort Sumner,</v>

392
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:04.280
<v Speaker 1>some 100 miles from Lincoln.</v>

393
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.851
<v Speaker 1>Why now?</v>

394
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln had a new sheriff and his name was pat garrison.</v>

395
00:16:07.861 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 1>He was single minded with his obsession to capture billy the kid.</v>

396
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Garrett was a tenacious,</v>

397
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:14.770
<v Speaker 1>determined man.</v>

398
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He and his posse tractability and his gang over the winter of 18,</v>

399
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:22.220
<v Speaker 1>82 of the outlaws were killed in a shootout with the others being cornered in</v>

400
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.690
<v Speaker 1>cabinets,</v>

401
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 1>a place called stinking springs.</v>

402
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 1>After attempt standoff believe finally came out with his hands in the APP.</v>

403
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.030
<v Speaker 1>The kid was transported by train to Santa Fe and put on trial for the murder of</v>

404
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:32.864
<v Speaker 1>Sheriff Brady.</v>

405
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.100
<v Speaker 1>He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging the next and supposedly</v>

406
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 1>last stop was Lincoln where he was housed in a second story room of the bank and</v>

407
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 1>county courthouse.</v>

408
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>It was there that he was to wait for his date with the news,</v>

409
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.520
<v Speaker 1>but well billy,</v>

410
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 1>he had other plans on April the 28th,</v>

411
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.281
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

412
00:16:49.281 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>81 in the early afternoon.</v>

413
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Billing told us God that he needed to use the privy.</v>

414
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>The guard escorted him in shackles to the outhouse on the way back as he went up</v>

415
00:16:57.351 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 1>the stairs to his room,</v>

416
00:16:58.341 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but he managed to slip out of his hand and shackles.</v>

417
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.480
<v Speaker 1>He turns and wrestled with the gods,</v>

418
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 1>managing to grab his gun.</v>

419
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>The mountains tend to flee,</v>

420
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:06.260
<v Speaker 1>but believe shot him dead.</v>

421
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>The kid then made for one of the rooms in which he knew there was a shotgun.</v>

422
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Quickly loading it.</v>

423
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:13.570
<v Speaker 1>He ran through a window and looked down on the street to see another God,</v>

424
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Bob [inaudible],</v>

425
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>who had been eating his lunch across the way comes from wanting to investigate.</v>

426
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Billy called out hello barb,</v>

427
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>before blasting him with both barrels with both gods,</v>

428
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:23.271
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

429
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:23.570
<v Speaker 1>billy.</v>

430
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Then race downstairs.</v>

431
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 1>He commandeered a horse and was away,</v>

432
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but he's daring escape,</v>

433
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.350
<v Speaker 1>made them the most famous outlaw in the country,</v>

434
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 1>but it also made him a three time cop killer.</v>

435
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.080
<v Speaker 1>This changed Garrett's mind now.</v>

436
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to hunt him down and kill him despite this,</v>

437
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and he chose to remain in New Mexico.</v>

438
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 1>The reason being is that he had fallen in love with a 16 year old girl by the</v>

439
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>name of polly to Maxwell back in Lincoln.</v>

440
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Garrett was receiving information as to the whereabouts of the kit.</v>

441
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.110
<v Speaker 1>They were being supplied by the older brother of police at peace maxwell who was</v>

442
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.700
<v Speaker 1>not happy about this romance.</v>

443
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.480
<v Speaker 1>He told Gary that billy was in Fort Sumner.</v>

444
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Garrett finally moved on the intelligence he stole into Fort Sumner on the</v>

445
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 1>evening of July 14th,</v>

446
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 1>1891 with two deputies alongside him.</v>

447
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 1>They went straight to the home of the maxwells posting the two deputies on the</v>

448
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.260
<v Speaker 1>front porch.</v>

449
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>She entered the house from the back and made for the bedroom of peet maxwell.</v>

450
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 1>At this very moment that he was approaching the porch in the dark,</v>

451
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 1>he could only just make out the shape of the two men there and he called out who</v>

452
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

453
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.660
<v Speaker 1>but there was no reply at this belly.</v>

454
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Cautiously backs through the open doorway inside garrison maxwell were sitting</v>

455
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>on the bed on seeing the figure.</v>

456
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell leaned over and whispered to him garret levels,</v>

457
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 1>his six shooter and fired.</v>

458
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Then either kids fell,</v>

459
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 1>dad's never knowing who had fired the fatal bullet,</v>
