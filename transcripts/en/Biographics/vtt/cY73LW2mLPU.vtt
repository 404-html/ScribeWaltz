1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Ebas meteoric rise to dominate the personal transport market has made it one of</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>the most successful and the most hated companies in history,</v>

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>along with his controversial CEO,</v>

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Travis Kalanick.</v>

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It has developed a reputation as being iron fisted,</v>

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>cruel and relentless in its pursuit of power,</v>

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>inspiring an equal measure of admiration and loading.</v>

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Uber has turned the traditional taxi industry on its head and provided customers</v>

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>with a more user friendly way of getting from point a to point b.</v>

10
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>In the mid 19 nineties with the worldwide web still in its infancy,</v>

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>the undergraduate computer science association,</v>

13
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:49.821
<v Speaker 1>or you see a Ucla University in Sunny California was a breeding ground for</v>

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>future millionaires.</v>

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>The association was more of a clubhouse sweat.</v>

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Likeminded students could relax after class while they played games and talked</v>

17
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.404
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

18
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>though not a founding member rate,</v>

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>young San Fernando Valley residents by the name of Travis Kalanick soon became a</v>

20
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>central figure of the group.</v>

21
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Colonic was pursuing a double major in computers and business just like the baby</v>

22
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>of Internet companies up north in Silicon Valley.</v>

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>The USCPA was mostly fun and games.</v>

24
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

25
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>soon it's members stumbled upon an opportunity because there were no firewalls</v>

26
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

27
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>It was possible to search for files on all connect to computers and then index</v>

28
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>the results.</v>

29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>The group decided to replicate the time honored practice of college.</v>

30
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Kids lending out their record albums,</v>

31
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>but they were able to extend the lending for Tennessee to anybody who was</v>

32
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>connected to the Internet.</v>

33
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>The idea was molded into a startup which they named scour.</v>

34
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a tool that would scrub it,</v>

35
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>networks files,</v>

36
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>looking for mp3s.</v>

37
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Travis Kalanick was not involved in the founding of scour because he was doing</v>

38
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>an internship within cell,</v>

39
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>but as scour became established and grew in popularity,</v>

40
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>he'd jumped on board.</v>

41
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>He was in charge of marketing and fundraising.</v>

42
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.301
<v Speaker 1>It was in this role.</v>

43
00:01:57.301 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>There's colonic developed the on the job training that would serve him in later</v>

44
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>years living at his parent's house.</v>

45
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>He would spend up to eight hours a day on the phone,</v>

46
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>wheeling and dealing in order to attract investors.</v>

47
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>In 1999,</v>

48
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>his efforts paid off when Hollywood power player Michael Ovitz port $4,000,000</v>

49
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>into scour in return for a 51 percent share in the company within a year.</v>

50
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

51
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>the writing was on the wall for scour it's success had attracted to competitor</v>

52
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>who would do things better.</v>

53
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>This competitor was napster.</v>

54
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Scour is fundamental.</v>

55
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Problem was that it didn't scale these sites.</v>

56
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Words often crashed through over use and scour was running out of fresh</v>

57
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>concepts.</v>

58
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.491
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

59
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>napster was paying close attention to scour problems.</v>

60
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>They introduced a tweak I listening to a song would automatically make it</v>

61
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>available to others.</v>

62
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

63
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>napster quickly became a viral sensation.</v>

64
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Scour tried to gain grounds by moving into sharing movie files,</v>

65
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately they were deemed the company went into bankruptcy in two</v>

66
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.513
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

67
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.223
<v Speaker 1>By the end of that,</v>

68
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>with scour gone.</v>

69
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four year olds,</v>

70
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Travis Kalanick had no college degree and no job.</v>

71
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>He needed a new plan and they needed it fast.</v>

72
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Within weeks of the folding of scour,</v>

73
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>calumnick was onto his next project.</v>

74
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>He teams up with former scour partner Michael Todd to form red swoosh,</v>

75
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>which was essentially scour recreated for business customers.</v>

76
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>This new startup would allow companies to use the Internet to share similarly</v>

77
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>large files with their customers.</v>

78
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Enabling large file movements was already big business,</v>

79
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but red swoosh is competitive.</v>

80
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Advantage was that it capitalized on the asset light strategy to keep its costs</v>

81
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>below that of competitors.</v>

82
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Redswoosh pushed and pulled files from personal computers owned by others,</v>

83
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>foreshadowing what uber would later do in connecting writers with drivers who's</v>

84
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>caused represented massive unused capital on city streets.</v>

85
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>As the CEO of red squares.</v>

86
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Colonics job was to pitch the potential clients as he had done it,</v>

87
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>scour who sat a forensic work based proving to be the quintessential workaholic,</v>

88
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.901
<v Speaker 1>just what it is,</v>

89
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>gone Ganju and efforts.</v>

90
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

91
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>redswoosh became a victim of the peaking of the Internet.</v>

92
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Bubble investments dried up and tensions rose calumnick blamed for</v>

93
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.191
<v Speaker 1>mismanagement,</v>

94
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>sins wrangled for him to be kicked out of the company,</v>

95
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>colonic capital willing,</v>

96
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and it looked as if he had found a savior on September the 11th,</v>

97
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:16.571
<v Speaker 1>2001.</v>

98
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>He was scheduled to meet with a potential partner investor named Danny Lewin.</v>

99
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Lewin,</v>

100
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

101
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>was on board American Airlines flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles,</v>

102
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>which crashed into the north tower of the world.</v>

103
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Trade Center is the one that he was the first day after confronting the</v>

104
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>hijackers by the end of 2001 red swoosh was out of money.</v>

105
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Reprieve came in the form of a father and son team who had made a fortune from a</v>

106
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>semiconductor business,</v>

107
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>James and Jerry Chow.</v>

108
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to pour $300,000 into the business in return for a 30 percent stake</v>

109
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>over the next few years.</v>

110
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.011
<v Speaker 1>Red swoosh,</v>

111
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:48.844
<v Speaker 1>stumbled along,</v>

112
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>propped up by further investments,</v>

113
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and then in April of 2007 major competitor,</v>

114
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Akamai purchased the company hiring the handful of employees of the company,</v>

115
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.840
<v Speaker 1>including Collar Kalanick was now 31 years old for his share in the sale of red</v>

116
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>swoosh.</v>

117
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>He had pocketed around $3,000,000.</v>

118
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

119
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>he was now tied to a large corporation as an employee,</v>

120
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>something he had never experienced before.</v>

121
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Over the next year,</v>

122
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>he works to continue building the red switch brands.</v>

123
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.650
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

124
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>the restyled himself as an angel investor for young entrepreneurs.</v>

125
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>He bought an old house in the Castro and Old San Francisco neighborhood and</v>

126
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>named it the jam pat that's became a meeting place for fresh tech based ideas</v>

127
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.494
<v Speaker 1>with no money.</v>

128
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Calumnick reveled in the role of is the oldest age who had been there and done</v>

129
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

130
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.901
<v Speaker 1>His blog,</v>

131
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>which was called swishing,</v>

132
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.920
<v Speaker 1>became essential reading in it.</v>

133
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>He described his home,</v>

134
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the jam pad as a place where entrepreneurs regularly come to hang out to rap on</v>

135
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

136
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>to jam with other entrepreneurs,</v>

137
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>to play tennis and gears of war,</v>

138
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.980
<v Speaker 1>and to have a fantastic healthy meals made by the jam pads in house chef colonic</v>

139
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.761
<v Speaker 1>quits,</v>

140
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>red swoosh in late 2008.</v>

141
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>He spent the next couple of years biding his time as he examined new business</v>

142
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>ventures.</v>

143
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>He also threw himself into leisure activities.</v>

144
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>He became a part of a group called the random traveler society.</v>

145
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>They would randomly spin a globe to you,</v>

146
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>decide where in the world they would travel.</v>

147
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>In 2010 colonic got heavily involved with the q and a website called formspring.</v>

148
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.990
<v Speaker 1>He invested in the company that was soon running the show.</v>

149
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

150
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>he was still looking for other opportunities.</v>

151
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>He was introduced to a smartphone APP by the idea of an old friend named Garrett</v>

152
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>camp.</v>

153
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The APP was called Uber Cab and it's allowed the user to make a quick contact</v>

154
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>with the limousine in the San Francisco area.</v>

155
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Galenic began sharing his time between formspring spring and Uber Cab.</v>

156
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Within a few months it became obvious that he had to choose between them.</v>

157
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>The people that form spring were pushing him to become their CEO,</v>

158
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>but in late September,</v>

159
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>2010,</v>

160
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>he walked into a board meeting and declared,</v>

161
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be Uber.</v>

162
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.150
<v Speaker 1>In the summer of 2008 Garrett camp,</v>

163
00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>a miles managed Canadian software designer was waiting for a cab in San</v>

164
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Bay area.</v>

165
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.950
<v Speaker 1>He'd been waiting nearly 30 minutes for a cab that had promised to be there in</v>

166
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>just 15 when he saw an empty cab from a competitor company come by.</v>

167
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>He hailed it and got in.</v>

168
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.120
<v Speaker 1>A few minutes later,</v>

169
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>he got a call from the original taxi company asking where he was.</v>

170
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.750
<v Speaker 1>He replied that they relate,</v>

171
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>so he had gotten in another taxi.</v>

172
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>This became a regular occurrence for camp.</v>

173
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Eventually both taxi companies that he dealt with,</v>

174
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.310
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>

175
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>soar and yellow blacklisted him.</v>

176
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>This annoying the young Canadians who just so happened to have $75,000,000 in</v>

177
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>his bank account after selling his first startup stumble upon hailing a cab was</v>

178
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Speaker 1>now more difficult for camp.</v>

179
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>The taxi switchboard companies who had cut him off as soon as they saw his</v>

180
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>number one evening while standing on a street corner and running late for a</v>

181
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>date.</v>

182
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>He had the proverbial light bulb moments.</v>

183
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>He had his brand new apple iphone in his hands.</v>

184
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 1>That phone was gps enabled.</v>

185
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't he requests a cab directly from his phone simply by pushing a</v>

186
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 1>button that says,</v>

187
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>pick me up this way.</v>

188
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>You cut out the dispatcher,</v>

189
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>entirely gamble,</v>

190
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.480
<v Speaker 1>so knew that the iphone included a thing called an accelerometer.</v>

191
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>This allowed for the tracking of not just where a car was,</v>

192
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but also how fast it was moving with this technology map could be generated that</v>

193
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 1>showed the beginning and end of the trip along with its duration and price.</v>

194
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It would also have lengthy rider with the driver cutting out the middleman and</v>

195
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 1>August the eighth,</v>

196
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>2008 campaign.</v>

197
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Thirty $5 to reserve the website.</v>

198
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.111
<v Speaker 1>Uber.</v>

199
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>The cab dot Khan,</v>

200
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>he then began to elicit feedback about his idea from his circle of</v>

201
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial friends.</v>

202
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>He also interviewed a taxi driver who complained about the hours that they were</v>

203
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 1>sitting idly waiting for a fat.</v>

204
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Slowly other people began jumping on board.</v>

205
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 1>One of them was Travis Kalanick in early 2009.</v>

206
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Travis contributed in an idea that became pivotal to the future of the Uber</v>

207
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Model.</v>

208
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Rather than buying a fleet of vehicles,</v>

209
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>which camp was envisioning clinic told him that he didn't need to buy cars,</v>

210
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>just give the APP to drivers and let them be free agents.</v>

211
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>They would work when they wanted to work.</v>

212
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 1>The focus for both men was on limousine rides rather than normal taxi cab rides</v>

213
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>clinic signed on as an advisor that you go with a 10 percent stake in the</v>

214
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

215
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>It took over a year to develop the APP by January 2010 campaign candidate again</v>

216
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>testing the service.</v>

217
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>They also began making plans to launch operations in San Francisco.</v>

218
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Colonic had a 27 year olds,</v>

219
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>General Electric Middle Management employee named Ryan Graves to oversee these</v>

220
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco launch.</v>

221
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Graves began visiting marriages.</v>

222
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you sign up?</v>

223
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.053
<v Speaker 1>Limo drivers.</v>

224
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>The service launched in late May of 2010 with just a handful of drivers and</v>

225
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>

226
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>The original customer base came from twitter followers who had been keeping tabs</v>

227
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>on what the entrepreneurs were obsolete colonic and graves who had been made CEO</v>

228
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

229
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>working together to find investors after receiving a lot of knock backs.</v>

230
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>The C funding rounds raised one point two,</v>

231
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000.</v>

232
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point the clinic decided to go full time with Uber Cab,</v>

233
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't content to play second fiddle to a guy that he had hired.</v>

234
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>He orchestrated a demotion for graves and claims the title of CEO for himself.</v>

235
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He also demanded that his shareholding rise from 10 percent to 23 percent.</v>

236
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>On the very day that kind nick became CEO.</v>

237
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>The company received a cease and desist from the San Francisco Metro Transit</v>

238
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Authority and California Public Utilities Commission.</v>

239
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It stated that the name Uber Cab meant that they were a taxi cab company and</v>

240
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>under the authorities direction colonic solve this problem in five seconds,</v>

241
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>he simply changed the name of the company from Uber Cab to simply uber at the</v>

242
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 1>time of his taking over the operation.</v>

243
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>It was tiny and it made plenty of mistakes.</v>

244
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Speaker 1>On Halloween of 2010,</v>

245
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 1>they offered a discount to writers.</v>

246
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 1>This created such a huge demands on their already busiest day yet,</v>

247
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but it left a lot of people unable to get a right despite this growth was steady</v>

248
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>throughout 2010.</v>

249
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Then over the 2011 new year period,</v>

250
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely blew up.</v>

251
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Word of mouth was responsible for the exponential growth in Uber's customer</v>

252
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>base,</v>

253
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>but finding limo drivers,</v>

254
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>well that was a different story.</v>

255
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have the same social media habits as the young about towners in need</v>

256
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:47.071
<v Speaker 1>of a limo,</v>

257
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

258
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Only licensed drivers were eligible to drive for Uber.</v>

259
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 1>They all had customers if their own and none of them were prepared to go</v>

260
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>exclusive with uber either began giving away.</v>

261
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Iphone is preloaded with the Uber App to drivers.</v>

262
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>This enabled them to increase their driver supply,</v>

263
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 1>to keep up with the ever growing demand in San Francisco.</v>

264
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Having proven the model in San Francisco,</v>

265
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 1>colonic started to replicated in other cities under the guidance of the head of</v>

266
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:11.491
<v Speaker 1>operations,</v>

267
00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:12.324
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Graves,</v>

268
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 1>they turned their attention to Seattle,</v>

269
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

270
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>

271
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.180
<v Speaker 1>and Washington DC.</v>

272
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.193
<v Speaker 1>In each city.</v>

273
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Graves made connections in the tech world.</v>

274
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

275
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 1>This created buzz and attracted cutting edge Jesus.</v>

276
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Once the word was being generated,</v>

277
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>they began looking for drivers and working through government regulations.</v>

278
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 1>As they moved from city to city,</v>

279
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>the Uber team began refining their playbook,</v>

280
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>refining the system,</v>

281
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and making us more efficient.</v>

282
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 1>This process became one established buzz in the tech community to assess</v>

283
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>

284
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

285
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>recruiting drivers for developed pricing.</v>

286
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

287
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.860
<v Speaker 1>we local media and six capitalized with social media buzz.</v>

288
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.671
<v Speaker 1>In the early days,</v>

289
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>calumnick was a master at local public relations.</v>

290
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Promotion would start with a blog post in which you would relate how much he</v>

291
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.234
<v Speaker 1>loved the city,</v>

292
00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>where they were moving in suit.</v>

293
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>He would highlight it's key attributes and then he would talk about how much</v>

294
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>greater the city would be.</v>

295
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>When Uber had introduced their service by 2011,</v>

296
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 1>the job of securing investment,</v>

297
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>it was much easier in February,</v>

298
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 1>benchmark capital pour $10,000,000 into the company at this point.</v>

299
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.840
<v Speaker 1>If it was valued at $60,000,000,</v>

300
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the company had 9,000 customers and one point $8 million dollars in net revenue.</v>

301
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.900
<v Speaker 1>It was estimated that it would get to $100,</v>

302
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.661
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

303
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Gross revenue within a year had achieved that goal in six months.</v>

304
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>As we burst sprang up in more and more cities across America,</v>

305
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 1>it began to receive pushback.</v>

306
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.350
<v Speaker 1>The sixth city that it went into was Washington DC.</v>

307
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Before they could get it off the ground,</v>

308
00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>whoever the city's taxi commissioner announced that it was operating an illegal</v>

309
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:48.790
<v Speaker 1>taxi operation on Martin Luther King.</v>

310
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Day Two Thousand and 11,</v>

311
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the commissioner ordered an uber which took him to a press conference at the</v>

312
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 1>mayflower hotel.</v>

313
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>He then proceeded to impounds the driver's car and issued a $20,000 tickets,</v>

314
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but either they didn't back down.</v>

315
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 1>They assured all drivers that they would pay all of their fines and took the</v>

316
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 1>moral high grounds in public asserting that they would not a taxi company and</v>

317
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 1>therefore not subject to regulatory provisions in one city.</v>

318
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 1>After another taxi companies,</v>

319
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>the taxi commission and local and state agencies came into uber to shut it down.</v>

320
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Under the guidance of consultants,</v>

321
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Bradley Tusk,</v>

322
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Iba fought back.</v>

323
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>They ran social media campaigns to stop the opposers,</v>

324
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.270
<v Speaker 1>often meeting them in court.</v>

325
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 1>The public were overwhelmingly on the side of the company,</v>

326
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but there was one thing that Uber's customers were not happy about during busy</v>

327
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 1>periods such as rush hour into bar closing times.</v>

328
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It would apply surge pricing with the rates going up during these peak demand</v>

329
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

330
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Surge pricing had the effect of encouraging more drivers to work and encouraging</v>

331
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 1>some customers to find the cheapest service.</v>

332
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Both of these results is the demand on the service,</v>

333
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>but it also infuriated the customer base.</v>

334
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Many of them blamed the unfairness of surge pricing at the foot of CEO Kalanick,</v>

335
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>who quickly became known as a cutthroat business man who refused to listen to</v>

336
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>consumer sentiments.</v>

337
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 2012,</v>

338
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Uber was operating in 27 locations in that year.</v>

339
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 1>They also introduced uber x providing rides and hybrid cars,</v>

340
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but it was also the year that Uber faced.</v>

341
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It's first serious competition.</v>

342
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It's getting from a young San Francisco company called Lyft.</v>

343
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Lyft was a ride sharing business whereby a person would slap a launch pink</v>

344
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>mustache on the grill of their car and then pick up those you're in need of a</v>

345
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:31.840
<v Speaker 1>ride for the shared cost of gas and a little extra donation.</v>

346
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Usually this would work out to be less than the cab fare for the same distance</v>

347
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 1>to use a smartphone app that was modeled off the Uber App.</v>

348
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Lyft was a hit with young people who preferred it's friendlier,</v>

349
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:42.380
<v Speaker 1>more laid back.</v>

350
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Image riding in a limo was starting to look elitist.</v>

351
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

352
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 1>uber sat about restructuring its game plan.</v>

353
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.360
<v Speaker 1>It would rebrand itself with a focus on getting a from point a to point B as</v>

354
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>quickly and inexpensively as possible.</v>

355
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Uberx,</v>

356
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>which had started out as an ECO friendly alternative to a limo,</v>

357
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>became the means of being traditional taxi services.</v>

358
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 1>In early 2014 colonic hard former Amazon executive,</v>

359
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Holden as product development manager holding identified two things he</v>

360
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>found lacking in the uber system,</v>

361
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 1>the ability of the writer to communicate beforehand where he wanted to go,</v>

362
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 1>and the driver's ability to navigate that.</v>

363
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>He oversaw two new features to fix this destination,</v>

364
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 1>input by the writer and turn by turn navigation on the driver app,</v>

365
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.240
<v Speaker 1>both features where it hits,</v>

366
00:15:27.241 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of 2004,</v>

367
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Eva was operating in 262 markets worldwide.</v>

368
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Uber was now a genuine phenomenon,</v>

369
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 1>but it was a phenomenon that had attracted a lot of enemies.</v>

370
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.601
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

371
00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>a lot's of that animosity was thanks to the brash nature of the CEO,</v>

372
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Travis Kalanick,</v>

373
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 1>his outspokenness and inability to hold his tongue made him the offender.</v>

374
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.550
<v Speaker 1>In chief clinic was the poster boy for political incorrectness,</v>

375
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 1>one stating that he could land women as quickly as a person could summon an</v>

376
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>uber.</v>

377
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.891
<v Speaker 1>Colonics.</v>

378
00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Dificid personality only underscored hoover's growing reputation as a bully in</v>

379
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:02.894
<v Speaker 1>the marketplace.</v>

380
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Reports were publicized if some underhanded tactics used to undermine</v>

381
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:07.041
<v Speaker 1>competitor.</v>

382
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Lyft publications began labeling Uber as an evil company and describing a ceo as</v>

383
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 1>an an rand's loving libertarian nutjob.</v>

384
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.690
<v Speaker 1>In some cities,</v>

385
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>it became politically correct to avoid either altogether.</v>

386
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It was in a strange position worldwide.</v>

387
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>It's business was growing from strength to strength.</v>

388
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.751
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

389
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:24.230
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

390
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 1>it's reputation was tanking.</v>

391
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Things went from bad to abysmal.</v>

392
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.550
<v Speaker 1>When an uber driver in Delhi was convicted of raping a passenger,</v>

393
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>something had to be done.</v>

394
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to be done quick.</v>

395
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.710
<v Speaker 1>In 2015,</v>

396
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Uber brought on a new executive to oversee digital and physical safety.</v>

397
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Joe Sullivan,</v>

398
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 1>he had a long to do list including a stricter management of driver activity.</v>

399
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Things were tightened up to the extent that Iba management can tell if a driver</v>

400
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 1>is holding his phone while driving or braking too hard or going too fast.</v>

401
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 1>During that year,</v>

402
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.750
<v Speaker 1>another new executive,</v>

403
00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:59.751
<v Speaker 1>Sally K said about us taking and overcoming a slew of local regulators who were</v>

404
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 1>intent on stopping uber in its tracks.</v>

405
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.400
<v Speaker 1>By the beginning of 2016,</v>

406
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Uber was on a more even keel rather than lurching from crisis to another.</v>

407
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 1>In an attempt to change its image,</v>

408
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 1>the company teamed up with mothers against drunk driving to encourage young</v>

409
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>people to take an uber rather than drink and drive.</v>

410
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.800
<v Speaker 1>It also partnered with hospitals to make it cheaper for cancer patients to</v>

411
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 1>return home from treatments.</v>

412
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Travis Kalanick has been working on introducing driverless cars to the Uber</v>

413
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:32.630
<v Speaker 1>makes since 2013.</v>

414
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>He loved the idea that it would no longer rely on the most uncontrollable of</v>

415
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:38.090
<v Speaker 1>business variables,</v>

416
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

417
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 1>autonomous vehicles would be far safer as robots are not subject to drowsiness</v>

418
00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:44.084
<v Speaker 1>or distraction.</v>

419
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Further robots would be cheaper than people,</v>

420
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but in 2013,</v>

421
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 1>the technology,</v>

422
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't ready yet.</v>

423
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 1>By February of 2014,</v>

424
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Uber was canvassing the world looking for top robotics talents or purchase a</v>

425
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>pittsburgh company called Carnegie robotics,</v>

426
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 1>making it the kernel of it's self driving car team.</v>

427
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Then in December of 2014,</v>

428
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 1>hired 60 researchers from the national robotics engineering center.</v>

429
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 1>After two years of development,</v>

430
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Uber announced in August 2016 that it's caused.</v>

431
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 1>We're ready for unlimited showing.</v>

432
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.451
<v Speaker 1>The call has worked,</v>

433
00:18:14.451 --> 00:18:17.790
<v Speaker 1>but they still require a human engineer behind the steering wheel just in case</v>

434
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 1>something went wrong.</v>

435
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Uber are today still working on their driverless car.</v>

436
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 1>In that quest,</v>

437
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>they are in a race with the likes of Google,</v>

438
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:24.630
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

439
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 1>and Tesla,</v>

440
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 1>the latter of which is rumored to be considering its own ride sharing business.</v>

441
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 1>All of this competition will ultimately result in a better,</v>

442
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 1>cheaper service for those of us who are wanting to get from point a to point b</v>

443
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 1>as effectively and cost efficiently as possible.</v>

444
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>So I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.</v>

445
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.021
<v Speaker 1>If you did this,</v>
