<v Speaker 1>He is recognized as the greatest athletes of modern times in the boxing ring,</v>

2
00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:08.450
<v Speaker 1>that he was nothing short of superb punishing his opponent so well and it was</v>

3
00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>outside of the ring that he would have his greatest battles and show the world</v>

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>what it really meant to be a man.</v>

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>And this episode of Biographics,</v>

6
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>we discovered what it was that made a Mohammad Ali the absolute greatest.</v>

7
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just a job.</v>

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.081
<v Speaker 1>Grass grows,</v>

9
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>birds fly waves pounding the sand.</v>

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.403
<v Speaker 1>I'd beat people up.</v>

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Cassius Marcellus clay was born on January the 17th of 1942 in Louisville,</v>

12
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky.</v>

13
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Cassius Sr was it east sign paints out while his mother Adesa worked as a maid</v>

15
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>for a wealthy White Family in Louisville are precocious but polite child.</v>

16
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Young Cassius was raised as a god fearing baptist along with his younger</v>

17
00:00:59.081 --> 00:00:59.381
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

18
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Rudy and his younger years.</v>

19
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>He gave no indication to his athletic future.</v>

20
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>He steered clear of sports,</v>

21
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>preferring to play marbles with Rudy Ball,</v>

22
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>read comic books on his bed in 1954 when he was 12 years old,</v>

23
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Casios and a friend rode their bicycles to the Columbia Auditorium,</v>

24
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Speaker 1>which was hosting the Louisville home show.</v>

25
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>They spent the afternoon checking out the wares of various African American</v>

26
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>merchants and gorging themselves on the Free Popcorn and candy that was on offer</v>

27
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>when they emerge from the exhibition.</v>

28
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 1>The boys were dismayed to discover the Cassius as brands new red and white.</v>

29
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>A Schwinn bike was missing the why.</v>

30
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>it had been stolen.</v>

32
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Cassius was absolutely livid with rage drawing an upset.</v>

33
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.780
<v Speaker 1>He began asking people if they'd seen who took his bike.</v>

34
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 1>A woman suggested that he reported the theft to officer Joe Martin who operated</v>

35
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>a boxing gym in a nearby basement finding.</v>

36
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Martin Cassius explained to what has happened.</v>

37
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that he was going to wobble whoever had taken his bike,</v>

38
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Marta,</v>

39
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>and it had been teaching boxing for decades,</v>

40
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>asked if the boy knew how to fight.</v>

41
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>When Cassius admitted this,</v>

42
00:01:59.231 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 1>he didn't.</v>

43
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>The officers suggested that maybe he has a learn.</v>

44
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.971
<v Speaker 1>Well this,</v>

45
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>this was the beginning of a long friendship and to Glorious Korea,</v>

46
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.813
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

47
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.531
<v Speaker 1>Cassius.</v>

48
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>He threw himself into boxing training with a passion and commitment that</v>

49
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>impressed Martin.</v>

50
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Although we had it very little natural skill,</v>

51
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>he had more heart than anyone else in the gym.</v>

52
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It raced to the gym as soon as school let out and would train even on Saturdays.</v>

53
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Martin had simply never seen a kid work quite so hot outside of the gym.</v>

54
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Cassius stayed away from anything that would interfere with his training.</v>

55
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>He was displaying the kind of determination and discipline that was lacking in</v>

56
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>many of the older boxes that Martin coached Martin.</v>

57
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>He introduced Cassius to at local boxing trainer named Fred stoner who helped</v>

58
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>teach him the fundamentals of the sport under the guidance of these two men,</v>

59
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>young play began winning one man.</v>

60
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>What about after another month after month,</v>

61
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>

62
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>a handful of amateur winds built up a formidable records.</v>

63
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 18 he had won 108 bouts,</v>

64
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>six Kentucky Golden Glove Championships and two national Aau titles in the ring.</v>

65
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Cassius absolutely fearless.</v>

66
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>He carried a self confidence and a belief in his ability that put his opponents</v>

67
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>off guard before the first ground bell met even sounds it,</v>

68
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but this was in great contrast to his personal life because there he really</v>

69
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.594
<v Speaker 1>struggles.</v>

70
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a poor student with teachers unable to understand why he couldn't</v>

71
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>transfer the dedication you put into his sport into his studies.</v>

72
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>No one realized at the time that has struggles in school they would do to the</v>

73
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.040
<v Speaker 1>reading disability dyslexia in February of 1957 professional boxer,</v>

74
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>but Willie Per Strano visited Louisville with his trainer,</v>

75
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Angelo Dundee Cassius found out where he was staying and phoned for Strano his</v>

76
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>hotel room.</v>

77
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>If I was picked up by done deep,</v>

78
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Cassius blurted out that he was going to be the world's greatest boxer and that</v>

79
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to meet for Strano with nothing on their schedule.</v>

80
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>That afternoon done the infrastructure actually invited Cassius.</v>

81
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a hotel room for the next several hours?</v>

82
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Cassius peppered Australia with questions only pausing long enough to predict</v>

83
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>his own future.</v>

84
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Greatness of amused Angelo.</v>

85
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Dundee was impressed with the boy ends.</v>

86
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.813
<v Speaker 1>Kept in touch with him.</v>

87
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>He's sometimes since Cassius and his family free tickets when one of his boxes</v>

88
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>had a fight in lines up in Louisville.</v>

89
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.930
<v Speaker 1>In March,</v>

90
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.080
<v Speaker 1>1959 Cassius was training in a gym in Chicago,</v>

91
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Illinois prior to an Aau talks bout,</v>

92
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 1>the hood.</v>

94
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Some other boxes talking about a group called the nation of Islam who were re</v>

95
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 1>spousing black pride back.</v>

96
00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Louisville.</v>

97
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He decided to learn more about the group by doing a school assignment about</v>

98
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

99
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.570
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

100
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.310
<v Speaker 1>his teacher shut the idea down,</v>

101
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>telling him that the group was dangerous and that they preached hatred against</v>

102
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 1>all white people.</v>

103
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Play,</v>

104
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.340
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

105
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 1>was still intrigued by the nation of Islam.</v>

106
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.120
<v Speaker 1>He got ahold of a copy of a newspaper that they put out and started reading as</v>

107
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:03.110
<v Speaker 1>much as he could about them.</v>

108
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.250
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

109
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>he was wrestling with the weighty decision about what direction to take his</v>

110
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 1>boxing future.</v>

111
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.340
<v Speaker 1>People that have been talking him up as a hot prospect for the 1960 Olympics in</v>

112
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Rome,</v>

113
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but at that time only amateurs are able to compete in the Olympics,</v>

114
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.320
<v Speaker 1>so he had to decide if he was going to town professional or compete in Rome as</v>

115
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.630
<v Speaker 1>part of the United States is boxing team.</v>

116
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point 30 turned to his friend Angelo Dundee for advice,</v>

117
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>don't told Cassius that he could earn more money as a pro if he was an Olympic</v>

118
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:32.901
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

119
00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

120
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.101
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

121
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:37.400
<v Speaker 1>he decided to stay in his amateur career runs compete in the Olympics.</v>

122
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 1>at the time the American Olympic team was set to depart for Italy.</v>

124
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Playing was in peak physical condition and mentally primed for victory,</v>

125
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.330
<v Speaker 1>but there was one slight problem.</v>

126
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 1>He was absolutely terrified at the prospect of flying on a plane.</v>

127
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.400
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

128
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>he was so terrified that he always passed up the opportunity to represent his</v>

129
00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:56.804
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

130
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

131
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>he finally relented when it's old mentor Joe Martin convinced him to fly.</v>

132
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>We think parachute on his back.</v>

133
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately it Cassius,</v>

134
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>it didn't need to operate as parachutes in the plane.</v>

135
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Touched down in room without any incidents.</v>

136
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.100
<v Speaker 1>He started as an employee campaign with a quick two rounds when over Belgium's</v>

137
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Yvonne,</v>

138
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.890
<v Speaker 1>because that wind was followed by another win over the Soviet Union's getting</v>

139
00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>reduced shat cough.</v>

140
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>He was the previous gold medal winner at the 1956 Olympics.</v>

141
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Cassius then triumphed in the semifinals,</v>

142
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>defeating Australia's Antony Madigan.</v>

143
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>The only person standing between play and Olympic glory was Poland's is a big</v>

144
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>new patters as Koski in the contrast of Cassius,</v>

145
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>who would only been boxing for six years.</v>

146
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.390
<v Speaker 1>This man was a three time European champion and even at one bronze in the 1956</v>

147
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>

148
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.901
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

149
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>it was clay who played the more aggressive game,</v>

150
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>throwing an avalanche of punches to take the first round lead the Polish champ.</v>

151
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>he was simply unable to recover and at the ends of three rounds,</v>

153
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Cassius claimed the Olympic,</v>

154
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>a light heavyweight gold metal gaseous.</v>

155
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>He returns to Louisville eight local hero with even the mayor turning out to</v>

156
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>receive him.</v>

157
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 1>He was so proud of his victory that he wore his gold medal everywhere.</v>

158
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>About a week after his return,</v>

159
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>he had a friend's doctor into our restaurant to get out of the rain.</v>

160
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>That's when they tried to order a couple of cheeseburgers and milkshakes.</v>

161
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>They were told that the restaurants did not serve black people and they were</v>

162
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.124
<v Speaker 1>thrown out.</v>

163
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Cassius clay was an Olympic champion.</v>

164
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

165
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>it was still a second class citizen in his hometown standing on the second</v>

166
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>street bridge.</v>

167
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed his gold medal,</v>

168
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>ripped it from his neck and threw it into the Ohio river.</v>

169
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Despite his frustration with the social climates,</v>

170
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Cassius was facing a bright boxing future turning professional.</v>

171
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.710
<v Speaker 1>He was sponsored by a group of local white businessmen who agreed to sponsor</v>

172
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:48.130
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

173
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>They offered to pay him at $10,000 up front and to cover all of his training</v>

174
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:52.984
<v Speaker 1>expenses.</v>

175
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.620
<v Speaker 1>In return,</v>

176
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>they would take half his earnings for the next six years.</v>

177
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Despite these impressive victories in Rome,</v>

178
00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>boxing pundits didn't expect a great career for clay.</v>

179
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>The consensus was that he had quick footwork,</v>

180
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.960
<v Speaker 1>but not much else.</v>

181
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 1>He spent too much energy.</v>

182
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>They said dancing around the ring man's.</v>

183
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>When he lands back to protect his face,</v>

184
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.590
<v Speaker 1>he would leave his body exposed.</v>

185
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.011
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

186
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Cassius relied on his long reach to strike his opponents from a distance gaseous</v>

187
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:16.511
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

188
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to train under Angelo Dundee,</v>

189
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but as sponsors sent him to California to work with a trainer by the name of</v>

190
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Archie Moore.</v>

191
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 1>He made his pro debut in front of his home crowd on October the 29th of 1960 his</v>

192
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 1>opponent was Tonya,</v>

193
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 1>hadn't sacco clay one the fights with a unanimous six round decision.</v>

194
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It was a great start to his pro career,</v>

195
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>but to clay.</v>

196
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't happy with Archie Moore,</v>

197
00:08:37.441 --> 00:08:38.280
<v Speaker 1>his training style,</v>

198
00:08:38.281 --> 00:08:42.600
<v Speaker 1>and he headed to Miami and doest Angelo Dundee to take over as his trainer dumb.</v>

199
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.331
<v Speaker 1>He agrees,</v>

200
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Speaker 1>but it meant the Cassius had to live in a very rough neighborhood that was</v>

201
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:48.250
<v Speaker 1>filled with gangs and drugs and prostitution.</v>

202
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

203
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 1>he took immediately to his new training environments flourishing under the</v>

204
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>tutelage of date.</v>

205
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.520
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

206
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>it became evident that Cassius was an absolutely masterful self promoter.</v>

207
00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

208
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 1>his mouth,</v>

209
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>it worked faster than his fists.</v>

210
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>He never tired of announcing that he was the greatest,</v>

211
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>the prettiest,</v>

212
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and the fastest athlete to ever step into a ring.</v>

213
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>But he was soon encouraged to talk himself up even more.</v>

214
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1961 clay travel to Las Vegas for a boxing match.</v>

215
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>While in Vegas,</v>

216
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you went to see a wrestler by the name of Gorgeous George Cassius watched as</v>

217
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>George acted outrageously.</v>

218
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>He was trash talking his opponent for an upcoming match he talked to endlessly</v>

219
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.100
<v Speaker 1>before band,</v>

220
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>even during the match,</v>

221
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>the whole crowd,</v>

222
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>well that made them read for the other guy.</v>

223
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.621
<v Speaker 1>But after the match,</v>

224
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Cassius met George backstage.</v>

225
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>The rest of their explained that is self promotion was designed to get as many</v>

226
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>people as possible to pay to come and see someone shut his mouth.</v>

227
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 1>He advised clay to keep sassing his opponents and to always be outrageous.</v>

228
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>He also told him to find himself a gimmick that would set himself apart.</v>

229
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:49.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

230
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:50.191
<v Speaker 1>clay,</v>

231
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 1>he soon found his gimmick.</v>

232
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.220
<v Speaker 1>He would predict the round that he would win the match him</v>

233
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.371
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

234
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:07.670
<v Speaker 1>November the 15th 1962 Cassius met his former trainer,</v>

235
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Archie Moore in the ring,</v>

236
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but bold claims that he had developed a lip,</v>

237
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:11.210
<v Speaker 1>a button,</v>

238
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.631
<v Speaker 1>a punch,</v>

239
00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>do finally silence the Louisville lip as Cassius had come to be known in</v>

240
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:16.761
<v Speaker 1>response play,</v>

241
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>predicted a fourth round knock outs,</v>

242
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.070
<v Speaker 1>bands.</v>

243
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.990
<v Speaker 1>That is precisely how the fight went down.</v>

244
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.651
<v Speaker 1>Cassius,</v>

245
00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>he was now a 16 when zero loss pro,</v>

246
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.780
<v Speaker 1>he felt he had an under shot at the heavyweight world champion Sonny Liston.</v>

247
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 1>He engaged upon a campaign of taunting list and into taking the challenge.</v>

248
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.970
<v Speaker 1>They began referring to the champ as a big ugly bear once even travel to his</v>

249
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>home town of Springfield,</v>

250
00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and banged on his door at three in the morning to call out the champ</v>

251
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.791
<v Speaker 1>clay.</v>

252
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:48.020
<v Speaker 1>He made absolutely sure the TV cameras were recording every second of this</v>

253
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:48.710
<v Speaker 1>charade.</v>

254
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Finally listed,</v>

255
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

256
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.880
<v Speaker 1>he had had enough and he agreed to take on the upstart.</v>

257
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.840
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight champ made a prediction of his own and that would be pain.</v>

258
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>There was no idle threats.</v>

259
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Listing was a mountain of a man who had a killer punch.</v>

260
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.420
<v Speaker 1>He was considered by many boxing experts to be unbeatable.</v>

261
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Cassius,</v>

262
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.430
<v Speaker 1>he trained hard for this,</v>

263
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>the biggest fight of his life,</v>

264
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't give it his absolute focus.</v>

265
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Both Cassius and his brother,</v>

266
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Rudy,</v>

267
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>they were becoming increasingly interested in the nation of Islam.</v>

268
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.020
<v Speaker 1>They started attending meetings and Cassius became enamored with the leader</v>

269
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Elijah Muhammad.</v>

270
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>He also took a great liking to the group spokesman,</v>

271
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.363
<v Speaker 1>knock Max.</v>

272
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 1>As the brothers started spending more time at the mosque in Miami,</v>

273
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm told Cassius to where his nation of Islam membership proudly when the</v>

274
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 1>title find sponsors learned that the challenger was associating with the nation</v>

275
00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:36.470
<v Speaker 1>of Islam.</v>

276
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.220
<v Speaker 1>They threatened to cancel the event unless he disavowed the grip it's played.</v>

277
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 1>He would not abandon his newfound faith.</v>

278
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.700
<v Speaker 1>He was prepared to walk away from boxing to stay true to himself.</v>

279
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

280
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:47.721
<v Speaker 1>the sponsors,</v>

281
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 1>they ultimately backed down and the fight he did.</v>

282
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

283
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.561
<v Speaker 1>Now listen.</v>

284
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:53.240
<v Speaker 1>He was used to knocking out opponents,</v>

285
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.213
<v Speaker 1>the early rounds,</v>

286
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>but clay,</v>

287
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>he was too fast.</v>

288
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.651
<v Speaker 1>It's quick feet,</v>

289
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>danced around the ring.</v>

290
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Anz Liston was simply unable to touch him after a grueling six rounds.</v>

291
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Liston,</v>

292
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.910
<v Speaker 1>he refused to come out for the seventh the 22 year old Cassius clay was now the</v>

293
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>youngest heavyweight champ in history as razor sharp canon is.</v>

294
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>When was it was superseded the very next day when he officially announced that</v>

295
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 1>he was a member of the nation of Islam and that he was changing his name to</v>

296
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Cassius x.</v>

297
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>A week later,</v>

298
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>that evolved into Muhammad Ali,</v>

299
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>the nation of Islam.</v>

300
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>They were very unpopular with most of America.</v>

301
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It was predicted this,</v>

302
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 1>if he fought list,</v>

303
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

304
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be anyone rooting for him.</v>

305
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:30.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

306
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>the two they did meet again on May the 25th 1965 many in the anxious crowds.</v>

307
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 1>They expect it to see Liston win back the title that he had lost Ali and instead</v>

308
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>they were stunned to see the former champ again knocked out in the first rounds.</v>

309
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>On November the 22nd 1965 Ali successfully defended his title against former</v>

310
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>champ,</v>

311
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Patterson.</v>

312
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Patterson had spoken out against the nation of Islam and refuse to call alley</v>

313
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 1>buying his Muslim name,</v>

314
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Ali.</v>

315
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>They didn't pay for this slight mercilessly pounding him while yelling.</v>

316
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Watched my na in 1966 alley defended his title five times four of those defenses</v>

317
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>being held outside of the United States.</v>

318
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 1>On February the sixth 1967 he fought it Ernie to realm.</v>

319
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:12.461
<v Speaker 1>Then Houston,</v>

320
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Texas to rail was enraged dally buying just like Floyd Patterson before him</v>

321
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 1>refusing the call only by his name.</v>

322
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.870
<v Speaker 1>The result was what many believe to be the worst beating ever dished out in a</v>

323
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 1>professional boxing match.</v>

324
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>The champion tortured DRL it for the full 15 rounds,</v>

325
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.960
<v Speaker 1>bringing him up just short of a knockout and then backing off only to wallop</v>

326
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>them again with the combinations.</v>

327
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Ali won a unanimous points decision.</v>

328
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:37.004
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

329
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Holly's next bottle.</v>

330
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Would it pit him against the might of the United States governments?</v>

331
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 1>On April the 28th 1967 he turns up at the Houston Induction Center for the US</v>

332
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>armed forces.</v>

333
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 1>When the time came for him to step forward to signify signifying his induction,</v>

334
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Allie didn't move.</v>

335
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Speaker 1>He explains that his religious beliefs prevented him from joining the army and</v>

336
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>killing people with whom he had no quarrel.</v>

337
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 1>He further stated that he could not in good conscious give support to a war that</v>

338
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:13.060
<v Speaker 1>he felt was morally wrong.</v>

339
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Within 24 hours,</v>

340
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Sally had been stripped of his heavyweight title as well as his license to box</v>

341
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 1>in every state in the country in an instant.</v>

342
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>That title he had worked so hard for was simply gone.</v>

343
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>When the u s government took away his passport,</v>

344
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.620
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even box oversees the governments well.</v>

345
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.990
<v Speaker 1>They had effectively taken away his livelihood.</v>

346
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

347
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>the champ was never going to lie down.</v>

348
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.830
<v Speaker 1>He became an unlikely hero to the millions of young anti war activists around</v>

349
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:39.664
<v Speaker 1>the nation.</v>

350
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.360
<v Speaker 1>He spoke at the most prestigious universities where he was introduced as the</v>

351
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 1>first national figure with the courage to stand up against the war in Vietnam.</v>

352
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.251
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

353
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>the late 1960s were lean years fanny.</v>

354
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>On August 17th,</v>

355
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 1>1967 he married Belinda Boyd,</v>

356
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>but next year they had a child,</v>

357
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Merriam but Ali's name.</v>

358
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>It brought him opportunities and he managed to make ends meet.</v>

359
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>He did everything from opening a restaurant,</v>

360
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 1>calls Champ Burgers to starring in a musical big time buck white.</v>

361
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 1>As the years passed,</v>

362
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Mohammad continued training and the hope that one day I would get the</v>

363
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to reclaim his title.</v>

364
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.821
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

365
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of the 1970s some promoters in Georgia,</v>

366
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 1>which didn't have the boxing commission organized about against Jerry Quarry,</v>

367
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.250
<v Speaker 1>though slower than he had been Helene,</v>

368
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>one in a convincing fashion is now.</v>

369
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Well other states they considered to let him fight again.</v>

370
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>If he could get another win under his belt,</v>

371
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.420
<v Speaker 1>he might even get a shot at a reigning champion of Joe Fraser.</v>

372
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.311
<v Speaker 1>Does it get up?</v>

373
00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Fraser?</v>

374
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm Molly has a Festa feet.</v>

375
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Oscar Bonavena the fight almost when the full 15 rounds,</v>

376
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:52.380
<v Speaker 1>we've Bonavena taking a great deal of punishments,</v>

377
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but he also dish down to a level of abuse that Mohammed had never had to</v>

378
00:15:55.891 --> 00:15:56.790
<v Speaker 1>withstands before.</v>

379
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Sill Molly one in the last round.</v>

380
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Tko the fight of the century,</v>

381
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.250
<v Speaker 1>the first ever between two undefeated heavyweight champs took place on March the</v>

382
00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:07.570
<v Speaker 1>eighth 1971 phrasing Angelina.</v>

383
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.120
<v Speaker 1>It traded blow after blow five years before that he would have easily dodged.</v>

384
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:12.811
<v Speaker 1>Some are phrases,</v>

385
00:16:12.811 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>punches person.</v>

386
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Now he could only take the hits and fight through the pain and the abuse,</v>

387
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>

388
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.900
<v Speaker 1>they went the distance.</v>

389
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It could have gone either way,</v>

390
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.920
<v Speaker 1>but in the end it was a unanimous decision to Fraser,</v>

391
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali.</v>

392
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.210
<v Speaker 1>He had suffered his first professional loss still.</v>

393
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.460
<v Speaker 1>He was determined to get back on top.</v>

394
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.430
<v Speaker 1>He followed up is lost by winning 10 fights in a row,</v>

395
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.280
<v Speaker 1>but it is 11th he was stopped by the formidable can.</v>

396
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Norton who broke his jaw,</v>

397
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:37.981
<v Speaker 1>but Ali,</v>

398
00:16:37.981 --> 00:16:41.880
<v Speaker 1>he came back in a rematch knocking out Norton in the six rounds and ends up</v>

399
00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:42.421
<v Speaker 1>after this.</v>

400
00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that came the rematch that he was really after he fought Joe Frazier who</v>

401
00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:50.490
<v Speaker 1>had lost his title to George Foreman for the second time on January the 28th</v>

402
00:16:50.491 --> 00:16:54.150
<v Speaker 1>1974 winning in a 12 rounds unanimous decision.</v>

403
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.261
<v Speaker 1>But Ali,</v>

404
00:16:55.261 --> 00:16:55.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

405
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.830
<v Speaker 1>he still did not have his title back to claim it.</v>

406
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.480
<v Speaker 1>He would have to defeat to the new champ.</v>

407
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.510
<v Speaker 1>This was the 24 year old foreman who would so far at one 40 fights and just lost</v>

408
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.580
<v Speaker 1>eight hadn't gone past the second rounds on paper.</v>

409
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It looked like the 32 year old elite did not have a chance.</v>

410
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 1>The fighter took place in consortia Zaia on October the 30th 1974 over the early</v>

411
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:18.601
<v Speaker 1>rounds.</v>

412
00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:22.530
<v Speaker 1>It appeared as if Ali was out of his depth with form and apparently pounding him</v>

413
00:17:22.531 --> 00:17:23.280
<v Speaker 1>at will.</v>

414
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.120
<v Speaker 1>What are the was actually doing was allowing foreman to punch himself to</v>

415
00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion and the eight rounds at Mommy's,</v>

416
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it came to life and delivered a devastating series of blows.</v>

417
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The put foreman on the canvas the champion had reclaimed is heavyweight title.</v>

418
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.401
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>

419
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:41.490
<v Speaker 1>he faced drew Fraser for the third time and he believed that this was the</v>

420
00:17:41.491 --> 00:17:45.690
<v Speaker 1>hardest fought heavyweights clash of all time rounds after rounds.</v>

421
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.180
<v Speaker 1>The stunned crowd watched in horror as the battered boxes somehow fought beyond</v>

422
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion and the ends ballet was declared the winner in the 14th rounds.</v>

423
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.500
<v Speaker 1>He was so exhausted that he couldn't even stand up to celebrate.</v>

424
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

425
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.740
<v Speaker 1>an aging all the defendant,</v>

426
00:18:08.741 --> 00:18:13.120
<v Speaker 1>his title seven more times before squaring up to an unknown challenger by the</v>

427
00:18:13.121 --> 00:18:18.121
<v Speaker 1>name of Leon Spinks on February the 15th 1978 I'll leave underestimated the</v>

428
00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:21.550
<v Speaker 1>challenger training lightly and it's not taking the fight seriously enough.</v>

429
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.120
<v Speaker 1>That night he lost his title to a man who didn't deserve to be in the ring with</v>

430
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:26.020
<v Speaker 1>him at his prime.</v>

431
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Eight months later to smoke obvious signs of developing Parkinson's disease,</v>

432
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.790
<v Speaker 1>he avenged the loss to claim an unprecedented third world heavyweight</v>

433
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:34.624
<v Speaker 1>championship.</v>

434
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.553
<v Speaker 1>Nine months later,</v>

435
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.670
<v Speaker 1>he retired from the ring,</v>

436
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.270
<v Speaker 1>but is time out of the ring would last for less than a year.</v>

437
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.200
<v Speaker 1>On October the 18th 1980 he suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of his</v>

438
00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:45.370
<v Speaker 1>former sparring partner.</v>

439
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.420
<v Speaker 1>30 homes.</v>

440
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.380
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>

441
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.370
<v Speaker 1>he was dispatched by a far less impressive Trevor Burdick time.</v>

442
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

443
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.980
<v Speaker 1>it had finally caught up with Mohammed Ali over the next decade,</v>

444
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:57.370
<v Speaker 1>has Parkinson's disease steadily got worse?</v>

445
00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.120
<v Speaker 1>The body that had served him so well was giving up on him still,</v>

446
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.170
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't done yet.</v>

447
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.520
<v Speaker 1>In the late 1980s Mohammed Ali embarked on a new career as a humanitarian</v>

448
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.370
<v Speaker 1>statesmen and its promotion of Tolerance and peace weld,</v>

449
00:19:09.371 --> 00:19:09.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

450
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.470
<v Speaker 1>But at the time he left us on June the third 2016 he was recognized as one of</v>

451
00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:18.670
<v Speaker 1>the great men and certainly the greatest athlete of the 20th century.</v>
