00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.750
And let's get into the video.

18
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.790
John D Rockefeller was a businessman who amassed one of the largest fortunes in

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.450
history.

20
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.040
He controlled the 90% of the oil in the country and at the time of his death he

21
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:09.090
was worth between 300 and $400 billion.

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.620
Today the name Rockafella is synonymous with wealth for this very reason,

23
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.420
and his legacy has lived on long after his death.
Today on biographics,

24
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:22.200
we tell the story of how a seemingly ordinary boy grew up to be the most

25
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.720
powerful man in the United States.

26
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.570
John D Rockefeller was born on July the eighth 1839 in Richford New York.

27
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.410
His mother aligns a Davidson,
had a total of six children.
His father,

28
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:42.700
William Avery Rockefeller called himself a traveling botanic physician.

29
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.570
This might sounds impressive,
but this was actually just a fancy name.

30
00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:48.070
Very snake oil salesman.

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.360
His father ends the nickname big bill for his larger than life personality.

32
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.040
These types of salesmen knowing me,

33
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.260
sold fake products to people promising that they're so called elixirs could cure

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.740
practically anything.

35
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.800
They will be usually charismatic showmen who truly knew how to get people civics

36
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:08.050
I did about a product that they were practically begging to give them money away

37
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.300
while big bill was traveling.
Across the country,

38
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:13.120
essentially stealing money from unsuspecting victims.

39
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.900
He would spend some time in each town before catching the next train.

40
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.770
He started a double life with a woman named Nancy Brown and had children with

41
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:22.540
that just by being so good at his job.

42
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.380
Big Bill always seem to struggle with money and the never seem to be enough to

43
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.740
give a rounds.
When he came back to visit a laser and this six children,

44
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.550
John d Rockefeller,
it was raised by his father to never trust anyone.

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.910
Big Bill opened his arms to capture John when he was still just a toddler,

46
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.410
but when the boy jumped,

47
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.130
his father stepped back and let him fall on the floor in order to teach them a

48
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:42.760
lesson.

49
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.170
Bill would also trick John and his brothers by making promises he never intended

50
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:50.590
to keep,
just so we can get them to do extra chores.
Big Bill once said,

51
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.550
I cheat my boys every chance I get.
I want to make them sharp.

52
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.310
John Rockefeller was the oldest son in his family,

53
00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:01.000
so he was the man of the house.
His father was gone as a child.

54
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.270
He would help his mother raised turkeys in that backyard so that they could sell

55
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.590
the meat they did on jobs for neighbors and for the most part,

56
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.810
they were forced to fend for themselves without much help from their father.

57
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.531
At one point,

58
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.910
Bill decided to come clean to both of his wives and revealed that he was

59
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.520
splitting his time between two different households.

60
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.790
He suggested that they all move in together as one big happy family.

61
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.470
This was big in me of course,

62
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:26.320
but it was not illegal in the United States at the time.

63
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.550
The moral anti-big and the act was passed in 1862 off to polygamy became more

64
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.480
prevalent among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints,

65
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.630
but the Rockefellers,
they weren't part of the LDS church.
Now,

66
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.500
he must have truly been a smooth talker because he somehow convinced both the

67
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.760
laser and Nancy to agree to a sister wives situation.
The family,

68
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.360
they moved to Cleveland,
Ohio and they told their neighbors there's Nancy Brown,

69
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.500
was that a live in housekeeper,

70
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.710
had Rockefeller was disgusted by his father's behavior.

71
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.340
He swore that he would never grow up to become that kind of man.

72
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.030
He decided to save his money and never wasted on frivolous things.

73
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.340
He also became very devoutly religious in the Baptist church,

74
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.760
held himself to a high moral standard.

75
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.740
This difficult family situation was most likely why he chose to start working as

76
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:15.610
quickly as possible so that he could move out and start an independent life away

77
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.010
from his parents and his father's mistress.

78
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.940
He often said that his goal was to make $100,000 which is the equivalent of

79
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:25.930
about $3 million today and to live to be a hundred years old.

80
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.360
Rockafella attended Cleveland Central High School,

81
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.750
but he did not want to wait until after graduation to become a businessman,

82
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.050
so he drops out of high school and so could just one business and accounting

83
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.150
class at Folsom.
Imagine Talk College.

84
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.870
This was enough experience to get them a job as an assistant bookkeeper for a

85
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.130
local merchant Scald,
cure it.

86
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:47.131
And Tuttle on September the 25th 1855 when he was only 16 he gains a lot of

87
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:48.790
valuable experience at this job,

88
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:52.840
but the only trouble was that his bosses only paid him 50 cents a date even

89
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900
after inflation that still only $13 and 36 cents which was nowhere near enough

90
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:01.390
to make a fulltime living even though they weren't paying him much.

91
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.560
Rockefeller was always extremely proud of the day that he got his first job.

92
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.390
He made September the 25th into his own holiday called job day and celebrated

93
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:14.260
the anniversary every year for the rest of his life like an a Rockefeller.

94
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.500
He had been friendly with the customers that Hewitt and Tuttle,

95
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.810
this Scaife and a great reputation around town.

96
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.230
He was always paying close attention to how everything works and he eventually

97
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.110
to them,
do all of the skills necessary to start his own business.

98
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.710
Since everyone in town knew him,
he managed to get a full thousand dollars loan,

99
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.170
which is worth over $100,000 today.

100
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.830
This was more than enough money to start trading in goods like,
hey,

101
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.900
meat and grain.
His business.

102
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.580
It managed an m $450,000 in the very first yet.

103
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.860
Now,
he didn't get to keep that money for himself of course,

104
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.820
because a lot of it had to go back into repaying the loan and business expenses,

105
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:53.200
but this was a great start to what would be a long and prosperous business.

106
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.560
Korea,
John Said,
God gave me money and he did not apologize for it.

107
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.300
In 1861 the United States broke out into civil war and Rockefeller felt very

108
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.130
strongly about being an abolitionist.

109
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.060
Rockefeller's younger brother Frank became wound very early in the war.

110
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.320
When John was drafted,

111
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.260
he actually paid a professional soldier to given its place that way.

112
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:15.950
He was able to continue running his business and contribute to the war effort.

113
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:19.160
At the same time,
he said,
I wanted to go in the army and do my part,

114
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:22.340
but it was simply out of the question.
There was no one to take my place.

115
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.300
We were a new business and if I had not stayed,
it must've stopped.

116
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.450
Believe it or not,
this was actually a common practice back then,

117
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.950
at least for the men who could afford it,

118
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.520
and by staying home he was also able to profit by selling supplies for the war

119
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.354
effort.

120
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.880
Today,
the oil industry is concentrated in the Middle East,

121
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.881
but back then it was heavily concentrated in the u s in 1849 a man named Samuel

122
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:52.100
care discovered crude island has property in Titusville,

123
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.340
Pennsylvania by the 1850s and sixties word spread,

124
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.570
which caused a huge boom known as the Pennsylvania oil rush.

125
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.920
Then we're moving to Pennsylvania hoping to strike it rich by setting up oil

126
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:08.120
rigs and tapping the grounds for their liquid of black gold.
At that time,

127
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:11.090
people needed oil for their lamps in order to see at night.

128
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.270
The only alternative was to process oil from whale fat,

129
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.170
but taking it from the ground was obviously a much easier process.

130
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.061
However,
the crude,

131
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.690
all that's found in the ground does need to be refined before it can be used by

132
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:24.524
a consumer.

133
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.250
Crude oil was being transported by train from Pennsylvania to various oil

134
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.600
refineries around the country.

135
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.650
John D Rockefeller had the brilliant idea of taking advantage of this rush by

136
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.170
building an oil refinery in Cleveland,
Ohio.

137
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.100
He was 24 years old at this point since he had decided that instead of

138
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:41.410
continuing to be a merchant,

139
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.500
he should devote all of his time and energy to growing his new oil business.

140
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.150
Rockafella he was still very frugal,

141
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.480
so he tried to save money by cutting out the middleman whenever possible.

142
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.390
Instead of buying wooden barrels from a third party company,

143
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.530
he bought thousands of acres of land so that has employees could cut down trees

144
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.650
and to make the barrels themselves in 1817 that's a man called Henry Flagler who

145
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.930
was interested in investing in Rockefeller is a business together.

146
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.960
They incorporated the standard oil company with Flagler's help.

147
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:09.771
Rockafella begins,

148
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:13.790
you buy up all of the smaller oil refineries in the Cleveland area so that he no

149
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:15.320
longer had any competitors.

150
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.100
Whenever any refinery refuse to sell their companies and Rockefeller would begin

151
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.540
selling as oil.
It's a loss.

152
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.300
So the customers would flock to him instead of the competition.

153
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.080
This would simply put the smaller companies out of business,
but he didn't stop.

154
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:30.920
That standard all began to spread to on the states and soon enough they were

155
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:33.830
refining 90% of America's oil.

156
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.610
He was now a million app at this point,
so the company was so huge,

157
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:41.390
it was impossible for one man to oversee the operations of the entire country.

158
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:41.901
That fall,

159
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:45.470
he decided to allow the former heads of the oil companies he purchased to become

160
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.150
his new board of trustees.

161
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.740
This created a super squad of the smartest oil experts in the country and he

162
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.680
made himself the head of this so called trust.

163
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.530
This sounds typical for blanche companies today who put her CEO as the

164
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.780
figureheads,
but back then,
this kind of empire,

165
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.320
it was unheard of and Rockefeller was setting the stage for other American

166
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:09.300
businesses as a leading example of how to acquire wealth and power.

167
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.010
In the 18 hundreds railroads were helping to eight America through the

168
00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:21.440
industrial revolution.
For the first time in history,

169
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:26.441
large cargo could be shipped across the country record speeds by the 1860s the

170
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:30.740
two biggest businesses in the United States where the railroads and oil,

171
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.400
so it only made sense that Rockefeller wanted to be involved in both of them.

172
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.960
He was actually plotting to create a railroad trust and do exactly what he had

173
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.580
done with the oil businesses.

174
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.000
He was already cooperating with the Vanderbilt family and he was going off to

175
00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:47.800
the owners of various railroads in order to purchase their stock and strike

176
00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:50.150
deals with the presidents of each one.

177
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.990
Rockefeller needed to be on good terms with railroads because he needed them to.

178
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:56.180
Transport is barrels of oil by train.

179
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.790
Since he on such a massive quantity of product,

180
00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:02.990
he negotiated with the Pennsylvania Railroad to get a discounted rate on

181
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:03.650
shipping.

182
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.400
Oh first this was working out really well and the Pennsylvania railroad went on

183
00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:11.660
a spending spree to expand the railroad before long.
The discounts are they gave,

184
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:14.960
Rockefeller was no longer enough to cover their costs and it would potentially

185
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.980
bankrupt the company,

186
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.570
so they have to go back on that promise and raise the price instead of giving
in.

187
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.490
Rockefeller responded by laying his own undergrounds pipelines and he reached

188
00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:27.590
out to work with other railroad companies.

189
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.030
Now the Pennsylvania railroad had just lost their biggest clients and their main

190
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:32.864
source of income.

191
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.760
In 1877 the Pennsylvania railroad started building that own all refinery so that

192
00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:39.890
they could put that trains to good use.
After all,

193
00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:42.170
the oil industry was their bread and butter,

194
00:10:42.171 --> 00:10:45.290
whether it came from Rockefeller or not.
Since Rockefeller,

195
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:48.680
it felt in a titled to control all of the oil.
He was outraged.

196
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.730
He stormed in to speak with the executives of the railroad saying why it is

197
00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:56.060
nothing less than piracy.
To make matters worse,

198
00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:59.930
the railroad employees began to strike across the nation because they were not

199
00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:00.764
getting paid.

200
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.420
There's became known as the great railroad strike of 1877 they finally buckled

201
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:10.250
under the pressure and sold that oil refinery to Rockefeller for three point $4

202
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.490
million.

203
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.930
10 years later in the u s government would pass the interstate commerce act

204
00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:17.600
switch forced regulations on the prices charged by railroads.

205
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.900
This prevented those companies from gouging the price of transportation.

206
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.680
From an outsider's perspective,
people did not see a railroad.

207
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.590
That broker contract.
They saw a Rockefeller as the villain.

208
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.380
People believed that he had far too much power.

209
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.070
Everyone could see the writing on the wall.
If Rockefeller was not stopped,

210
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.150
he may take over the railroad industry completely and after that there would be

211
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:42.410
no stopping him from taking more and more until there was nothing left for

212
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:43.244
anyone else.

213
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.800
The general public strongly disagreed with Rockefeller's tactics and they

214
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.130
believed that he was like a shock gobbling up smaller businesses is it already

215
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.820
happens in the oil industry and he was making moves in the railroad industry as

216
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:01.330
well.

217
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.170
People were terrified that he would eventually be so rich and powerful that he

218
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.510
might just take over the world newspapers.

219
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:11.320
They bashed standard oil and its political cartoons featured Rockefeller on a

220
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.190
regular basis.

221
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.050
Even President Teddy Roosevelt was very vocal about being antitrust and promised

222
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:19.420
Americans that he was going to do something to stop it.

223
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.890
The states of Ohio plan to create a new antitrust laws specifically to stop a

224
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:28.480
Rockefeller and standard oil from having a monopoly over the entire industry.

225
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.330
Since it was only a state law at that point is Rockefeller was able to

226
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:35.830
reincorporate in New Jersey in 1882 before they even had a chance to sue him.

227
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.010
He opened his new headquarters on Broadway in New York City.

228
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.790
Reincorporating in another state did not protect him for long though because in

229
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:46.360
the 1890 u s congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act,

230
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.540
which made it illegal in every state.
Two years later,

231
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.410
the Supreme Court declared that standard oil was violating this new law.

232
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.940
So how did Rockefeller deal with dissolving his monopoly?
Well,

233
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:01.780
he didn't see,
just figured out a legal loophole.
The board of trustees,

234
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.710
they divided up standard all amongst themselves and created smaller companies so

235
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:08.830
that technically they would no longer be considered a monopoly.

236
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.600
In 1899 these new companies were all brought back under the umbrella of standard

237
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:15.940
oil.
These are called subsidiaries,

238
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:19.300
which is when a small company is under the control of a logical operation.

239
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.630
Just a few examples of these smaller companies where BP,
Exxon,

240
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:27.410
Conoco Phillips and Chevron,
these companies all around to this very day.
Oh,

241
00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:29.440
that's fine.
There was a group of writers and journalists.

242
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:33.100
It's called a muck rakers and they took it upon themselves to uncover corruption

243
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.480
in American businesses.

244
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:39.070
One such journalist Ida Tarbell wrote a book in 1904 calls have a history of the

245
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:42.790
standard oil company where she went through the story of Rockefellers ruthless

246
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:44.230
rise to power.
She wrote,

247
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.580
Rockefeller and his associates did not build the standard oil company in the

248
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:50.740
boardrooms of Wall Street banks.

249
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.600
They fought their way to control by rebates and drawback,
bribe and blackmail,

250
00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.660
espionage and price cutting by ruthless efficiency of organization.

251
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.840
Toggle is remembered for being one of the most successful investigative

252
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:08.050
journalists of her time and many credit hire and the other muckrakers with

253
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.230
helping to dismantle the Rockefeller monopoly.
Burt,
of course,

254
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.280
people in the general public.

255
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:15.940
They didn't realize that these new old companies were not small business making

256
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:17.800
a comeback.
Rockefeller,
of course,

257
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:22.801
was still pulling the strings and for him our rows of another name was just a

258
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.693
sweet.

259
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.270
Even though there is plenty of information out there about the financial success

260
00:14:33.271 --> 00:14:34.440
of John d Rockefeller,

261
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.310
he was a fiercely private person and he tried his best to keep his family life

262
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.630
out of the newspapers.

263
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.800
What we do know is that when he was 25 years old in 1864 he married a woman

264
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.090
named Laura Spelman.

265
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.510
She was a devout Christian who worked as a school teacher and they were very

266
00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:52.640
much in love with one another.
He said of her,
her was always better than mine.

267
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.760
Without our keen advice,
I would be a poor man.

268
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.000
He wrote a beautiful love letters when he had to travel for business.

269
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.110
He once wrote,
what a blessing that I have such a good and true wife,

270
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.080
how much I would give for wings to reach you tonight.

271
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.230
All of this romance led to the creation of their children,

272
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.400
Elizabeth Alice Alta or you death,
and John Jr Sadly,

273
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.280
Palestine during infancy,
even though he was very busy,

274
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.200
he always made time to be with his family.

275
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.950
He was a loving father and a devoted husband who never took them for granted.

276
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.830
Now,
all his life,
Rockefeller had a very impressive mustache,

277
00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:28.880
but during the 1890s he began suffering from a condition called alopecia.

278
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.230
He began some news,
all of the hair on his entire body,
including his eyebrows.

279
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.190
At first,
he tried to hide it by wearing two pays,
but as he grew older,

280
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:39.470
he decided to let people see him in public.

281
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:44.210
After had lost all his hat in the 1990s a biographer named Ron Chernow got

282
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:46.910
permission from the Rockefeller family to write a biography.

283
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.570
He learns by speaking to his children and grandchildren that Rockefeller never

284
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:51.920
spoke much about his father,

285
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.310
and he never allowed big bill to be a part of their lives.

286
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.850
They also never met his half sisters and they were never given any of the

287
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:02.990
fortune because Rockefeller did not consider them to be a part of Israel family.

288
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.770
After digging through a mountain of paperwork or Ron Chernow finally found

289
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:11.030
William Avery Rockefeller's grave and a small cemetery in Freeport,
Illinois.

290
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.750
He was buried under an alias called Dr. William Levingston.

291
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.030
It would seem that even in death,

292
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:21.190
John d Rockefeller wanted the memory of his father to be entirely forgotten.

293
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.813
<v 3>Okay.</v>

294
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:31.800
<v 0>In 1897 and John D Rockefeller chose to retire from his position at Standard</v>

295
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:31.980
Islands,

296
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.980
left the control of the business to his board of trustees and to son John D

297
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.770
Rockefeller Jr in 1911 standard all was sued once again for violating the

298
00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:41.820
antitrust actions.

299
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.360
They were forced to split out into dozens of different corporate entities,

300
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.660
but he decided to invest in all of these new companies and it's ironically,

301
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.330
it's only made him more money on the stock market.

302
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.940
Estimates on Rockefeller Seniors,

303
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.980
true net worth vary anywhere from 300 to $400 billion and they give that some

304
00:16:58.771 --> 00:17:01.530
perspective.
The founder of amazon.com Jeff Bezos,

305
00:17:01.531 --> 00:17:06.090
who is currently the richest man in the world today is only worth $100 billion

306
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.870
only.

307
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:11.280
It's probably not a coincidence that Bayzos also practice the same exact method

308
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.810
that Rockefeller once did,

309
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.280
buying out smaller online bookstores during the expansion of amazon.com now,

310
00:17:17.281 --> 00:17:21.390
most people,
they cry to vilify John d Rockefeller,
but he wasn't bad.

311
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.880
He believed in the Christian tradition of tithing,

312
00:17:23.881 --> 00:17:27.480
so he had been giving a portion of his income to charity since he was 16 years

313
00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:31.680
old.
He gave it $70 million towards the founding of the University of Chicago,

314
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.310
and he also helped create the Spelman college in Atlanta,
Georgia,

315
00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:38.250
which was an all black women's school.
According to the New York Times,

316
00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:42.870
Rockefeller gave away $550 million in charitable donations to scientific

317
00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:45.930
research education as well as the Baptist church.

318
00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.220
Rockafella became well known in his later life with the practice of giving dimes

319
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:53.370
to adults and Nicholas to children wherever he went,

320
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.330
even gave dimes as a playful gesture is wealthy men such as Tom Mogul,

321
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:58.350
Harvey Firestone.

322
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.090
One of the best examples of his generosity also doubled as his legacy in the
end,

323
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:05.880
1930 Americans with suffering off to the great depression.

324
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.320
John D Rockefeller was already in his nineties so he decided to use a huge chunk

325
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:12.960
of his fortune to build the Rockefeller Center in New York City.

326
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.040
It was called a city within a city because it had dining shopping,
apartments,

327
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:18.390
and even a movie studio.

328
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.500
The project created 40,000 new jobs during construction and people were

329
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:26.160
gainfully employed once all of the businesses inside the center where open the

330
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:30.210
project was completed in 1933 and today the Rockefeller Center has become an

331
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:34.440
iconic part of Manhattan,
especially during Christmas time.
Biographer,
Ron China,

332
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.370
Richard Rockefeller.

333
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:40.080
What makes it problematic and why he continues to inspire ambivalent reactions

334
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.550
is that his good side was every bit as good as his bad side was.
Bad.

335
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.630
Seldom is history produced such a contradictory figure out.

336
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.680
John D Rockefeller Dye into just one year after completion of a center in 1934

337
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.980
he often told people that his goal was to live to be 100 years old,

338
00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.140
but he didn't make it past the 97 perhaps the best way to summarize his life was

339
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.970
a poem Rockefeller wrote himself at age 86 I was at.

340
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.630
He taught to work as well as play.
My life has been one long happy holiday,

341
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.610
full of work and full of play.

342
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:16.560
I dropped the worry on the way and God was good to me every day,

343
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.380
so I really hope you found that video.
