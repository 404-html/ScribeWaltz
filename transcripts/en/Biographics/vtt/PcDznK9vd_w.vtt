00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.870
It's full of infamous leaks that blew the government wide open,

10
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.760
but there's one set of leaks that stands head and shoulders above the others.

11
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.820
In 2013 a contractor with the national security agency or NSA quietly handed a

12
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:43.660
cache of documents to the Guardian.

13
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.890
These details how the NSA had been hoovering up information on millions of

14
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:50.080
Americans while lying to Congress.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.610
It was the single most explosive story of the post nine 11 era and the man

16
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.010
behind it all.
Well,
that was Edward Snowden,

17
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.660
a young computer whiz from North Carolina.
Snowden is today infamous.
Currently.

18
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.280
He's holed up in assign them in Russia.

19
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.640
He's both loved and loathed by millions to some,

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.050
he's a fearless whistle blower who sacrificed everything to do what was right to

21
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:15.700
others.
He's the 21st century version of a cold war to factor,
but the truth,

22
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.640
it's more complex than either of those portrayals.

23
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.620
Snowden's life is one of contradictions of surprises and enough shades of gray

24
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.410
to fill a million el James novels.

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Today we investigate the man behind the most notorious leak in American history.

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.233
<v 2>Cool.</v>

27
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.850
<v 0>If you know the name Elizabeth City,
North Carolina,</v>

28
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.570
it's likely because of the coast guard base by some measures the busiest in the

29
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.530
United States.
The base dominates the lives of local residents,
the Snowdens,

30
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.760
they were no exception.

31
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.650
When Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June the 21st in 1983 it was into a

32
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:58.700
family with deep military connections.
Youngest Snowden's maternal grandfather,

33
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.630
Edward J.

34
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.320
Barrett was a rear admiral and his father Lani also worked in the coast guard

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.060
for Snowden lemons or childhood in stills with deep respect for the services,

36
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.390
but it was also a childhood marked by something more tragic.

37
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.070
The slow breakdown of his parents.
His marriage,
lowly ans Elizabeth Snowden,

38
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.090
known to our friends as Wendy were high school sweethearts,
married young.

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.210
Although Wendy suffered from epilepsy.
Yep.
Wasn't debilitating.

40
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.760
She managed to get a job as a Maryland district court.

41
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.740
Clark moving the family north in 1992 but if the Snowdens were expecting their

42
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:34.820
new lives in Maryland to be easy,
all they were mistaken as Wendy and lawns,

43
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.050
marriage drifted young.

44
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.370
Snowden was stumbling into a crisis at high school despite being clearly

45
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:43.250
intelligent.
The teenage boy,
he didn't really excel at anything.

46
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.840
What do you missed?

47
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.020
Four months study after capturing glandular fever in 1998 it knocked him back to

48
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:51.230
a place that he couldn't recover from.
He flunked out of high school,

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.080
perhaps desperate to sell something from this debacle.

50
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.620
Snowden enrolls in computer classes and our and Dell community college,

51
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.970
but his prospects,

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.290
they were pretty low message board posts left around this time,

53
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.740
tinge with cheerful desperation about being unemployed.

54
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.470
The family stumbled on for another couple of years,

55
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.870
but by 2001 the writing was on the wall.
When do you get along?

56
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.320
Splits and Wendy took off Ellicott city.
Now Baltimore one year later,

57
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.270
19 year olds,
Snowden.
He followed her.
At this stage,

58
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:23.170
Edward Snowden was about as far from a potential biographics subjects is you're

59
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:27.850
likely to get his only achievement was being webmaster of an anime message
board.

60
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.930
Yep.
Even now,
there were two clues as to his future near to righty.

61
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.410
The first was his and comparable tech skills.
After enrolling,
it's an RN.

62
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.970
Snowden had discovered this.
He had not just an aptitude for computers,

63
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.170
but of genius.

64
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.310
Ellicott city is home to somewhere that's going to become very important to us

65
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:49.150
story.
It's home to the NSA's headquarters.
Unfortunately,

66
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:52.750
they real life isn't as narratively pleasing as fiction and we'll need to take a

67
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:54.490
quick detour in order to get that.

68
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.940
On march the 20th 2003 the US invaded Iraq,

69
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.340
although the main fighting was over by the end of May,

70
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.010
a call for new recruits went out and nationwide.

71
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.010
This cool struck a chord with the unemployed Snowden.

72
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.640
Maybe it was his family's coast guard backgrounds,
but for whatever reason,

73
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.450
Snowden felt compelled to join up in May,

74
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.690
2004 he reported for duty at Fort Benning,
Georgia.
His training,

75
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.810
it didn't last long.
Snowden later claims that he broke both legs,

76
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.840
but the army claimed he flunked out with Shin splints.
Either way.

77
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.170
The result was the same.
After barely a month snooted was discharged.

78
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.890
He returned to merrylands again and unemployed failure.
Finally,

79
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:34.780
in 2005 Snowden got a security guard job at Maryland Center for Advanced Study

80
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:39.190
of language and it was really here that our story could have ended except for

81
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.350
one little fact.
That center,

82
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.450
it was backed by the NSA and the NSA would desperate to recruit computer geeks

83
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.040
off of the Soviet Union.

84
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.310
Fell all the way back in 1991 America's intelligence agencies.

85
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.000
They went through an era of downsizing and shedding of staff.

86
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.500
That all changed on September the 11th 2001 faced with the new threat of

87
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:08.500
terrorism.
The agencies would desperate to make up for lost time.

88
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.280
They were all so desperate to catch up with evolving tech way into the two

89
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:16.510
thousands the senior staff was so technologically illiterate that it would be a

90
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:20.740
challenge for them to distinguish the difference between a laptop and a sandwich

91
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.610
and with that it was clearly time to start hiring our best tech guys and one of

92
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.150
the best just happened to be working as an NSA security guard.

93
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.570
Within months Snowden had switched his security job for it.

94
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.080
He must have made an impression because not two years after flunking out of

95
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:39.700
basic military training in mid 2006 young Snowden and got a job offer from the

96
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:44.701
CIA saying yes to that offer would turn out to be a key decision in his life.

97
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.960
The young it genius was whisked away to Geneva in Switzerland in 2007 while this

98
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:53.830
drug was a mixture of cool and not so cool from maintaining network security to

99
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.040
just fixing the ACC on the money it paid was certainly joke.

100
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.720
As a CIA technician,
Snowden was able to live every boy's James Bond fantasies.

101
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.080
He bought a brand new BMW,
befriended an Estonian Rockstar,

102
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.640
played the stock market boasting that had lost $20,000 in a single month.

103
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.290
He also traveled extensively your washing up in Rome,
Bosnia,
and in London.

104
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.910
Not that his opinions of these places were always PC of London's vibrant Muslim

105
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:24.400
community.
He wrote,
they were terrifying.
I didn't want to get out of the car yet.

106
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.200
Even in this dream job,
disillusionment could create them.

107
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.730
In 2008 Snowden supposedly witnessed the CIA arranging for a banker to be caught

108
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.480
drunk driving and then offering to suppress the charge and return for

109
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.780
cooperation.
The Swiss authorities.
They've denied this ever happened.

110
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.930
It's still the anguish that Snowden felt working for the CIA.

111
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.240
It was certainly the real he would like to claim.

112
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.260
Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government

113
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:48.950
functions.

114
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.540
I realized that I was a part of something that was doing far more harm than
good.

115
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.350
Not that he seems like a potential whistleblower just yet.

116
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.020
When the New York Times published a leaked Pentagon plans,

117
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:03.650
you attack Iran in 2009 Snowden raged online.

118
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:07.820
There's anyone who leaked such information to the press should be shot in the

119
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.990
balls still.

120
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.440
There was no doubt that Snowden was struggling with something in Geneva and it

121
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:17.000
was making him angry.
In February of 2009 he abruptly resigned from the CIA.

122
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.750
Later sources in the agency said that had been on the verge of being fired for

123
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.600
trying to hack into their database back in the United States.

124
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.320
The young computer whiz he underwent to change his message board posts the game

125
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:31.090
full of angry rants against government programs like social welfare ans

126
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.360
invective against Obama's new administration in a world full of angry young men.

127
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.140
It seemed Edward Snowden was simply another voice screaming into the void,

128
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.120
but it was one crucial difference here.

129
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.660
Snowden was still useful within a couple of months of leaving the CIA,

130
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:49.130
Snowden had a new job this time as a contractor for Dell working on NSA
projects.

131
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.050
The first was working on anti cyber spying software in Tokyo for a lifelong

132
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:57.290
anime fan and moving to Japan should have been a dream come true,

133
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.040
but instead at punched Snowden into a moral nightmare.

134
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.130
On April the fifth 2010 wiki leaks is Julian Assange previewed a leaked military

135
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:15.940
video at a national press club events known as collateral murder.

136
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.450
It showed the u s military pilots is gunning down to writers,
journalists,

137
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:21.280
mistaken for terrorists in Baghdad.

138
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.960
In 2007 the video was the first major scoop and the history of Wiki leaks.

139
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.520
It was also the beginning of the biggest intelligence leak in history throughout

140
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:32.500
the rest of the year.
Wiki leaks,
the Guardian,

141
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.130
The New York Times and Daesh Beagle published the Afghan war logs,

142
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.270
the Iraq war logs,

143
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:41.920
and finally a trove of us diplomatic cables that were leaks supplied to

144
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.440
wikileaks by intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.

145
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.090
The classified files turn the world's opinion of the United States upside down,

146
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.350
but not Edward Snowden's over in Japan.
The young it professional,

147
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:55.000
it become increasingly disturbed.

148
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.580
The work the NSA was up two on February the 18th 2010 he posted it on a message

149
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.150
board.

150
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.320
It really concerns me how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those

151
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.270
outside of technology circles.

152
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.950
Society really seems to have developed an unquestioning obedience towards spooky

153
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:15.210
types.
It wasn't until Manning's leaks shook the media that Snowden seems to have

154
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:17.640
decided to reveal the NSA's secrets.

155
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.900
In 2011 Dell trends heading back to Maryland from Japan on the outside.

156
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.110
This was perfect for Snowden.
He moved in with his younger girlfriends.

157
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.550
The free spirited Lindsay mills insights noted had made a decision.

158
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.330
It was while back in Maryland that he started downloading the documents that he

159
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:35.820
would soon release to the entire world.

160
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.530
In 2012 a Snowden contacted the tor project and online community dedicated to

161
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:44.250
providing everyone with the tools needed to encrypt their internet activity.

162
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.460
While this seems innocuous enough,
tool was deeply connected with wikileaks.

163
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.350
Many have suggested that Snowden made contact with tor as a way of getting to a

164
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:54.230
sauna.
If that was the plan,
though,

165
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.840
it's soon run into trouble with a capital t.

166
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.880
On June the 19th 2012 the wikileaks founder fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in

167
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:05.250
London to avoid an arrest on a rape charge.

168
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.070
The subsequent media Sakkas may have made snoot and rethink.

169
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.150
Wikileaks is the place to publish his revelations by now Snowden and mills.

170
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:16.830
They were in Hawaii where Snowden had to work on the is regional crypto logical

171
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.300
center.
At this point,

172
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.360
he was actively looking for opportunities to steal documents,

173
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.760
but he may have also been looking for something else.

174
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.250
Validation for his genius that some of Snowden,

175
00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:31.110
the hacks in the answers for an NSA job promotion test and subsequently aced it

176
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.400
when he was offered a new position.

177
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.460
He got angry that it wasn't high enough up and he rejected it.

178
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.210
Vanessa is deputy director would later tell reporters that he considers this the

179
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:42.840
moment when Snowden turned on the agency,
whatever the truth,

180
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:48.050
it wasn't only at work that people were noticing the change and Snowden in July,

181
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.280
2012 Lindsay mills blogs at the couple's relationship in Hawaii.

182
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.890
He was under stress by October.

183
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:56.670
She was writing about heavy conversations and stress paralysis,

184
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.930
whatever was preying on Snowden's mind.
It was certainly tormenting them.

185
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:04.800
Both that Thanksgiving bills returned to the US mainland to see our family for

186
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:06.720
an extended break.
While he was away.

187
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.040
Snowden finally set the wheels of his plan in motion on December the first 2012

188
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:15.420
guardian columnist and vocal wikileaks defender Glenn Greenwald gots a rather

189
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:16.470
unusual email.

190
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.270
This email suggested that he set up a PGP encryption software on his laptop.

191
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.780
Like anyone getting such a paranoid email.
Greenwald's ignored it.

192
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.310
Assuming the sender was a crank.

193
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.970
Let's all did Greenwald know that this was his first contact with a man who

194
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:31.470
would soon me cause Korea

195
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.070
a month off to being frozen out by Greenwald's Snowden.

196
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.180
Try it again this time he contacted the journalist's friends,
documentary maker,

197
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.050
Laura Poitras applied truss was deeply connected to the tor project that we

198
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:50.660
mentioned earlier.
When she first heard from Snowden,

199
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:54.120
she assumed that he was trying to in trapper,
but when a contact is at all,

200
00:11:54.121 --> 00:11:57.530
it gives nude in the green light.
She again to listen using a fake name.

201
00:11:57.531 --> 00:12:00.550
Snowden told portraits that he was a high ranking intelligence officer.

202
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.760
This was a total lie,
but the next part it wasn't.

203
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.480
He's holds a that he could get ahold of files that would paint the u s in a very

204
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.700
bad light if portraits wanted to see them.

205
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.240
All she had to do was get green mold on board than February.

206
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.900
Snowden changed jobs again while still working at the NSA's Hawaii sends her,

207
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:20.890
he took a pay cards to move from contracting with Dell to Booz Allen Hamilton.

208
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.000
His new role was a Sysadmin,

209
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.980
a row with two unbelievable bonuses for the potential Leeka.
One,

210
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.340
it made snow to and one of the only people at the NSA with a legitimate reason

211
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:33.160
to carry it normally forbid and thumb drives,
and two,

212
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.570
it gave them access to almost the entire system is still some to this day,

213
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:40.990
a skeptical this even assist admin could have access to so many confidential

214
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:42.100
areas without help.

215
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.280
It's thought Snowden may have stolen 14 people's login credentials to maximize

216
00:12:46.281 --> 00:12:47.240
his reach.
Pros,

217
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.740
node and sources say that he used to CIS admin title to trick people into

218
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:51.574
handing them over.

219
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.120
Andy's nerd and sources say that he may have received help from Russian

220
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:57.130
intelligence back in the real world.
Parks.

221
00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.180
Forests was desperately trying to convince greenwells that has sauce was on the

222
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:04.960
level that March,
they tentatively agreed to meet Snowden face to face,

223
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.870
yet the trio,
they missed the first chance.
That very month.

224
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.630
On march the 30th Snowden flew back to the u s maintenance,

225
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.650
but rather than go to meet the journalists see went to see his father on April

226
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:17.690
the fourth 2013 Lani and Edward,
they had dinner only.

227
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.780
He said that his son seemed preoccupied,

228
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.780
that something was weighing him down when they finished eating.

229
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.160
The two men hugged.
I love you that said,
Snowden.
I love you too son.

230
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.560
Nadia replied back in Hawaii,

231
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:32.530
the disconnect between Snowden's private and public lives,

232
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.890
it was growing at the same time he had mills moved into a new house.

233
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.940
Glenn Greenwald's was receiving two thumb drives with instructions on how to

234
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:43.570
encrypt as communications,
not the Greenwald was the only journalist.

235
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:45.400
Snowden was courting Barton Gellman.

236
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:49.600
If the Washington post was also in contact with Snowden in May of 2013 and was

237
00:13:49.601 --> 00:13:52.360
even given the first major cash if NSA files,

238
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.780
but Gelman wants it too much time for facts,
checking angry at the delay.

239
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.590
Snowden simply cut him off between a secret chats with Greenwald,

240
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.460
Gelman and portraits.
Snowden was laying the groundwork for his escape.

241
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.270
He told his employers that he was suffering from epilepsy just like his mother

242
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.890
and he needed some time off on May the 17th mills left for sailing vacation with

243
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:15.970
friends with remarkable understatements Snowden and told her that he might not

244
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:18.580
be around when she got back three days later,

245
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.480
the 29 year old travel to Honolulu airport and got on a flight to Hong Kong.

246
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.930
He had with him for laptops and a stack of thumb drives carrying an estimated

247
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:29.470
1.7 million top secret documents.
About a week later,

248
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.040
Greenwald got a message over his newly installed encrypted system asking him to

249
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:34.690
come to Hong Kong.
Not unreasonably.

250
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.280
Greenwald's asked why in response Snowden's send him a welcome package as

251
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.450
Greenwald I in the files,

252
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.460
his eyes went wild here and black and white was solid proof that the NSA had

253
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:45.911
knowing me,

254
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:50.170
lied to Congress about the extent of it's covert surveillance programs and this

255
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.590
it was just taster.

256
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.730
The main course would be waiting for him in Hong Kong provided that he would

257
00:14:55.731 --> 00:15:00.620
come three days later on June the first 2013 Greenwald was on a plane had if

258
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:01.850
Asia along with him.

259
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.880
Well Laura Poitras and veteran guardian reporter who in McCaskill the story of

260
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.910
the century have just begun.
Now before we get into that story of the century,

261
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.390
let me tell you a bit about Dash Lane Daschle and one of the sponsors you allow

262
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:16.370
us to make this longer form content.

263
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.220
Now this video talks a lot about data security,

264
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.150
but this isn't just something that nations have to be aware of.
You too as well.

265
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.980
Dash Shlain is a one stop shop digital identity protections.

266
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.330
That includes a VPN for all of your devices so you can use public internet

267
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.220
safely and anonymously.
They also do something called dark web monitoring,

268
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:38.480
which basically means they monitor the underbelly of the web for people selling

269
00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:41.740
your data and then alerts you if this is happening further.

270
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.320
If a service you have signed up for Equifax or Sony for example,

271
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.100
stuff is a breach nationally and tell you right away and they'll alert you to

272
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.430
other services which share that username and password so you can change that

273
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:55.610
information before hackers get access to those other sites.

274
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.490
Plus Dash Lane does what it's always done.
It stores your passwords,

275
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:00.290
it keeps you personal,
data's secure,

276
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.150
it fills all of those annoying boxes for payment info in passwords all for you.

277
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.100
A lot of dash lane is free,

278
00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:10.220
but there are some premium upgrades you can buy if you want to get more from the

279
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.940
service to see if those arrived for gear.

280
00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:15.980
You could take a 30 day free trial and after that to get a 10% discount code

281
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:21.130
using our code biographics at [inaudible] dot com forward slash biographics link

282
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:24.740
also below.
And let's get back to the story of the century,
shall we

283
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.420
mostly.
So when the dust had settled,

284
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:35.930
Glenn Greenwald would write that he was expecting to meet a veteran of the

285
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:38.600
intelligence services and the hyper crowded city.

286
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.750
The expected of someone middle aged grizzles and maybe some gray have very much

287
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.080
looking like a secret operative.
In Snowden,
though he got the exact opposite.

288
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.771
Prior to leaving,

289
00:16:48.771 --> 00:16:52.400
the reporters are arranged to meet Snowden in the lobby of the Mirror hotel and

290
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:55.160
imposing glass edifice and Trendy Kowloon.

291
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.950
It's no Dylan and supplied them with code words and said that he would be

292
00:16:57.951 --> 00:17:02.000
carrying a Rubik's cube the first day green mold and poetry is weighted only for

293
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.120
Snowden to not show.
The second day they waited again,

294
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.620
giving the on his pills for the heavyset ex military man carrying a Rubik's
cube.

295
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.500
When they saw skinny,
delicate Edward Snowden,

296
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.620
Greenwald later said that his heart sank still.

297
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.950
They started the script Greenwald sauntered up to the young man and asked,

298
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.750
what time does the restaurant open at noon came the reply,
but don't go there.

299
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.370
The food sucks for a moment.
The two stood there awkwardly.
Then Snowden muttered,

300
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.600
follow me and add them to this room.
Right up until Snowden began talking,

301
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:35.870
Greenwald was convinced that the whole thing was just a waste of time,

302
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.950
but as they settled into the anonymous room and Snowden began do spin his tail,

303
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.810
the doubt,
the melted away.

304
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.330
What was left was a feeling of sheer terror as poetry films.

305
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.250
Snowden told Greenwald how the NSA could hack any phone the world and turn it

306
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:52.260
into a microphone that spied on its owner.

307
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.220
He explained that nearly every social media platform had been compromised by the

308
00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:00.030
u s government and its allies in prison,
Israel and elsewhere.

309
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.160
We're also hoovering up metadata on every citizen and this gave them an accurate

310
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:09.000
picture of your entire life.
Your loves,
your dreams,
your frustrations,

311
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:12.510
your desires,
even the type of sleazy movies you like to watch.

312
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.670
All of this was available for them to access privacy.
It's just an illusion.

313
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.540
At some points,

314
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.310
Greenwald invited when McCaskill up to meet Snowden as the most experienced

315
00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:26.100
report to McCaskill would be able to sniff out if Snyder was faking it.

316
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.250
He even had a special code to use with the Guardian offices.

317
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.510
If Snowden was hoaxer,

318
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.560
hitech stays single sentence to the u s editor of the Guinness is bad.

319
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.610
No long after the text arrived at the Pampers officer's saying the Guinness is

320
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:41.760
good green walls ans McCaskill's fest story.

321
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:46.320
It went live at 7:00 PM on June the sixth 2013 did you telling how phone company

322
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.800
Verizon had allowed the NSA to collect data on millions of Americans.

323
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.190
It was an absolute bombshell.
Barely 24 hours later.

324
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.020
It was followed by Bart Gilman's,

325
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:59.820
delayed Washington Post story on the NSA's prison system and NSA headquarters.

326
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.510
The stories triggered a meltdown.
They knew they had a mole,

327
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.590
but they didn't know it was on June the eighth the agency use digital footprints

328
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.020
do identify snowed and as the likely leaker,

329
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:14.580
and this was the moment when the young hackers,
normal life,
it ended to this day,

330
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:16.860
the extent of Snowden's theft,
it remains unknown.

331
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.190
The NSA estimates 1.7 million documents went missing,

332
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.830
of which only 1% have been released,

333
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.170
something the rest found their weight to the Kremlin.

334
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.570
Others believe Snowden wasn't lying when he said,

335
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.590
you're talking to a copies to Russia like so much in this town of lies and

336
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:34.710
shadows.
The truth to this air remains hidden,

337
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.490
but on that day in 2013 the NSA,
they feared the worst.

338
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.660
At 3:00 PM on June the ninth Snowden consented to the Guardian uploading a video

339
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.210
in which she confessed to being the source of the leaks.

340
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.180
He claims had outed himself to control the narrative,

341
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:52.500
to stop the NSA spinning a false or counter story.
Former NSA analysts,

342
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:56.190
though they've said it's because he's an EGOMANIAC.
Before an hour was out,

343
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.230
the video was playing all over the world.

344
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.530
By the time morning dawns on June the 10th they widely Twitter user had

345
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:03.540
identified the Mirror hotel from its lamps.

346
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.760
As journalists converged on the hotel's,

347
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:10.080
Snowden commonly dressed and slipped out into the sprawling concrete jungle of

348
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:14.640
Hong Kong.
It was a sweltering day.
Yeah,
thick with humidity and Edward Snowden.

349
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.430
He was now the most wanted man alive.

350
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.980
The ripples that slowly spread out from the Snowden's vanishing acts.

351
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.670
They were many effecting people half the planet away in Hawaiian.

352
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:34.430
Lindsay Mills panics and pulls her own disappearing acts vanishing to America's

353
00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:37.850
west coast in Iceland.
I remember that Snowden was,
is headed there,

354
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.990
caused mass proce noted protests on the streets since a diplomatic incident with

355
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.330
the u s in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.

356
00:20:44.331 --> 00:20:46.750
Julian Assange leapt on the phone and demanded wikileaks.

357
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.510
Get a representative to Hong Kong and Co.
Op The story.
This is how many you go.

358
00:20:50.511 --> 00:20:54.790
Young Brits named Sarah Harrison wound up flying to the city with a mission to

359
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.360
track down the NSA,
Nika and Hong Kong itself.

360
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.570
A gang of human rights lawyers led by Canadian Robert Tebeau set up a safe house

361
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:03.760
system,
giving Snowden places to stay in the city,

362
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:08.761
slums as generalists and intelligence operatives combs the CD streets and waded

363
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:12.610
through pools of Neon Snowden disappeared into the homes of Hong Kong's

364
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:15.520
forgotten and neglected today.
Those that helped him.

365
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.910
All asylum seekers are known as the Snowden refugees.

366
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.330
Even without as made player though the story,
it's still rumbled.

367
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:25.160
On on June the 14th for the US Justice Department charge,

368
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:28.630
the missing contracted with espionage and arrest warrant was sent to the Hong

369
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.070
Kong authorities.
One week later,

370
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.920
Robert Tebow made contact with Hong Kong officials asking if they would extra

371
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.210
diapers.

372
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.560
Clients by now wikied at Sarah Harrison had successfully found Snowden when Hong

373
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.700
Kong's people declined to answer.

374
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:42.040
She suggested that he had for asylum in Ecuador.

375
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.090
The nes was closing it in an interview with Glenn Greenwald,
CNN.

376
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.510
Helpfully it reveals that Snowden Western in Hong Kong on June the 20 seconds us

377
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.190
authorities counseled his passport and with that snow didn't have to go on the

378
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:57.220
run.
The next day,
Snowden and Harrison boarded a flight to Moscow,

379
00:21:57.221 --> 00:22:01.570
supposedly intending to catch a flight to Havana and then another to Ecuador.

380
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.380
Hong Kong's possible control fail to detain either of them.
When asked why,

381
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:08.620
they would later say that the u s had follows an international arrest warrants

382
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:11.560
for Edward James Snowden,
Edward Joseph Snowden.

383
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.480
That's evening June the 23rd 2013 Snowden and Harrison touchdown Moscow's

384
00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:19.150
international airport.
To a media succuss,

385
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.450
someone likely and official and Hong Kong has leaks to the outline as

386
00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:25.060
destination to the press under international pressure.

387
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:26.560
Russian officials refuse to let.

388
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.410
Snowden bought his flight to Havana at the time that to me,

389
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:33.160
a Putin claims Snowden's arrival in Moscow was an unwanted Christmas gift.

390
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.611
However,

391
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:36.970
the Wall Street Journal has since claimed that Snowden was in contact with the

392
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:41.590
Kremlin and the last desperate days before his flight from Hong Kong.
Regardless,

393
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:44.480
it was here that Snowden's time as James Bond.

394
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.670
The finally ended stock in the International Transit Lounge of the apple for a

395
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.960
month.
His entire life was in limbo even as the Guardian and Washington Post kept

396
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:56.470
publishing stories based on his material so that would have been self was

397
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.180
regulated to a bit posh,

398
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.250
a strange ghost hanging around and apple at lounge on the 1st of August,

399
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.970
2013 over a month after he touched down Edward Snowden was allowed to leave the

400
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:09.220
app or with Harrison,
the whistleblower was granted.

401
00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:12.880
Temporary refugee state has in Russia and he's been there ever since.

402
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:13.810
But don't worry,

403
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.800
this video is not going to end with Snowden slinking out of Moscow airport,

404
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.060
one warm day in 2013 this still one more act to get through.

405
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.183
<v 3>Okay.</v>

406
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.620
<v 0>The legacy of Edward Snowden is a story in its own right,</v>

407
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.170
not least in how different countries treat us.

408
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:39.180
The revelations in the UK agents from Gchq rated the Guardian's offices and

409
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.830
smashed up their hard drives,

410
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.730
but long after parliament passed new laws actually expanding that agencies

411
00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:48.560
powers in the U S Obama led the charge personally criticizing Snowden,

412
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:52.790
but nonetheless setting up an independent panel examining us surveillance

413
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:53.570
practices.

414
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.800
In December of 2013 the panel recommended that a bulk collection of data be

415
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:00.320
suspended as unconstitutional.
Today,

416
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:04.550
the NSA operates under close congressional oversight.
So what else has happened?

417
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.200
Well,
the Snowden revelations arguably led to the use extremely strict Gdpr data

418
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:12.350
protection laws just as they led to Russia,
China,

419
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.720
and others passing data sovereignty laws,

420
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:18.350
meaning any data collected on their citizens must be physically stored on their

421
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:21.900
servers in their territory.
As for Greenwald and Co.
Well,

422
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.670
they wound up winning the 2014 Pulitzer Prize on the darker side.

423
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.200
US intelligence agencies have said the damage done by the leaks was irreparable

424
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.890
trust.

425
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.580
It was lost between nations and terrorists were given an intimate knowledge of

426
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:38.780
NSA operations as how the man behind this chaos.
Well,
it's been a mixed bag.

427
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.100
On October the ninth 2013 Edward Snowden was spotted in Moscow for the first

428
00:24:43.101 --> 00:24:47.030
time since leaving the airport not long after his father bond flew out to visit

429
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.120
quite what the two talks about.
Their day remains a mystery.

430
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.620
In March of 2014 snood and made his first online speaking appearance at Texas is

431
00:24:54.621 --> 00:24:56.630
south by southwest festival.
Today.

432
00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.910
Such engagements are his main source of income,

433
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.640
nursing him an estimated $200,000 a year.

434
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.610
What the life is all roses and honey for the man trapped in Moscow in 2018 need

435
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.180
desponded.

436
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.420
Snowden told reporters that Russia was a corrupt society and he no longer felt

437
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:13.340
safe that as for the United States,

438
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.400
Washington still considers the whistle blower I wanted man.

439
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.340
So at the end of all that excitement,

440
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.000
what can we really say about Edward Snowden?
Was he a hero or was he a traitor?

441
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.110
You're answer.
Well,
who really knows?
We can't really answer the question.

442
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.340
Despite what you hear on line,

443
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:32.270
it's likely that no one really knows the answer except for Edward Snowden

444
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:35.330
himself.
The story of Edward Snowden,
it's not over yet.

445
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.930
It could ends with an unexpected presidential pardon a week from now.

446
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.430
It could end in 60 years when Snowden dies alone in an anonymous Moscow

447
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:48.410
apartment.
Still I wanted man or it could end and a billion other ways.

448
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.850
All we know for sure is that the final chapter in the life of Edward Snowden is

449
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:56.840
still to be written,
but it's place in history.
Well,
