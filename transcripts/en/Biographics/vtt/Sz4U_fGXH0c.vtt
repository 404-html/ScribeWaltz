00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.400
There's a man who is known for the tails.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.110
He has his phone and told your children young and almost full grown ones like

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.520
how to Don's a hat.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.330
One Horton hears a who ends the Grinch who stole Christmas,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.350
got a new hot too.
He was a doctor named Zeus,

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.060
but not a doctor at all.

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
Just a man who loved writing for both big and small.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.950
On today's biographics,
we offer the story of Ted Geisel,

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
the American author.

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.310
<v 0>Theodore's excuse guys.
All was born in 1904 two German immigrants.</v>

12
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:47.000
His father owns a very successful brewery in Springfield,
Massachusetts.

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.781
As a Charles,

14
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.200
his favorite pastime was to go to the zoo with his family every single Sunday.

15
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.160
He was so good at drawing animals that his father bought him a sketchbook.

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.300
This he added to every weekends and his mom allows him to paint on the walls of

17
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:03.140
his bedroom.
His animals always looks like character cheers,
and from a young age,

18
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.590
his parents could tell that he had a very whimsical imagination after

19
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:10.160
prohibition in the 1920 [inaudible] father could no longer run the brewery.

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.030
It's actually chose to become the head of the Springfield Zoo in stat ted guys,

21
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.170
all good now go to the zoo and the sketch to the animals as often as he wants it

22
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.960
and to continue to do this for the rest of his life.

23
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.460
Growing up during World War One,

24
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:26.180
many children in school would make fun of guys or calling their family drunk and

25
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:30.680
Germans.
This stereotype only intensified during prohibition since their family's

26
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:32.300
livelihood came from making beer.

27
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.910
There's isolated him from his peers a lot and he spends a lot of time alone and

28
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.610
it was largely an introvert with the close friends he did have.

29
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:43.790
He would use this good sense of humor to cope with the bad times.

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.690
He was accepted to Dartmouth College and he started drawing short comics for

31
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:51.170
their humor magazine and his senior year guys all became the editor runs.

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.280
This was the beginning of a lifelong literary Korea.

33
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.400
One night the dean caught guys all drinking and a Negro bottle of bootleg Jen

34
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:02.340
and having a party in his dorm,
so he was removed from his position as editor.

35
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.110
He decided to secretly continue contributing to the magazine and went by the

36
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:10.580
Penn named Dr Seuss.
So use was his mother's maiden name and when he was born,

37
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:12.890
his parents made it his middle name in German.

38
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:14.510
It's actually pronounced Zoya switched.

39
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.930
I'm sure some commenter has commented in below before getting to this point in

40
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:18.440
the video,

41
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.830
but everyone always got it wrong when reading it with an American accent.

42
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.820
So he just decided to let people call him serious even though he did not have a

43
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:26.541
doctoral degree,

44
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:30.470
he decided to go by doctor instead of Mr because his father had always hoped

45
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:33.560
that his love of animals would have taken him to be a vet,

46
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.800
but instead he chose to be an artist and a writer in stat.

47
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.390
After graduating from Dartmouth,

48
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.690
he moved to England's to attend graduate school at the University of Oxford.

49
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
He plans to become a professor but and does not believing after just one

50
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.430
semester to move to New York City.

51
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.880
He was writing funny ads and illustrating them with characters and he was able

52
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:54.500
to publish his first cartoon in the Saturday Evening Post in 1927 in the

53
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:57.650
beginning,
Ted Geisel fully intended to write jokes for adults,

54
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.990
but there's ad contracts from publishing any comics in the funny papers because

55
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.170
his clients felt that it would be in direct competition.
However,

56
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.180
the contract and never mentions children's books,

57
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.640
which is why he decided to get started in that genre.

58
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.440
He wrote his first children's book and to think I saw it on Mulberry Street bus.

59
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.630
Every publisher rejected him.
The story is about a young boy.

60
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.530
He uses his imagination to and elaborate over the top details about where he

61
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.030
lives,
which is something that guys will always did as a child publishes,

62
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.410
saw this as encouraging children's Alliance.

63
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.630
They thought it would set about example.
At the time,

64
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.860
children's books were only meant to teach kids moral lessons about manners and

65
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.000
obeying their parents.

66
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.680
They were not exactly enjoyable to read and they were very strict rules about

67
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.540
what could not or could be in them.
Guys will continue to draw ads in New York,

68
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.590
but he eventually ran into one of his old friends from Dartmouth.

69
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:49.570
He just so happened to have gotten a job at a vanguard press.

70
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.620
His friends helps get Mulberry Street published the book only salt and modest

71
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.700
success,
but it was still enough to get his foot in the door of the industry,

72
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.250
the docsis,

73
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.990
you have spokes continue to feature stories where children web getting into some

74
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.550
kind of trouble.
His stories,

75
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.540
they were fun and it's much more than just a thinly veiled lecture now.

76
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.480
He did have to adjust and right to the market though,

77
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.930
and in 1940 doctors you switched over to random house and he published a book

78
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.520
called Horton hatches the egg,

79
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.330
which gives a moral lesson for children about loyalty and keeping promises.

80
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.230
This book became far more successful than any of his previous titles,

81
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.130
but on the brink of America's involvement in World War Two guys will was about

82
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.910
to take a very long break from writing children's stories

83
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.871
for a long time.

84
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:41.380
Guys will stop sketching pictures of whimsical creatures and began drawing,

85
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.270
hitting her instead.

86
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.900
What he felt that political cartoons were so important that he started working

87
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:48.670
for a liberal newspaper called PM,

88
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:51.220
which published his political commentary for years.

89
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.250
The United States refuse to get involved with the war in guys.

90
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.700
We'll strongly believe that the country needed to help the people suffering in

91
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.240
Europe.

92
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.390
He finally got his wish though because the United States entered world war two

93
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.290
in December of 1941 guys will ones into join and serve in the army,

94
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:09.130
but he was already in his late thirties which was Fante wold.
However,

95
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.010
he enlisted anyway,
and this is often looking over his resume.

96
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:15.990
The army recruiter made him into one of the propaganda playwrights and xeons and

97
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.810
the title of Captain Guys.
All they moved to Ted Geisel bent,

98
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:23.440
his wife found in Los Angeles and puts him in charge of the animation units.

99
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.010
This is where they worked on propaganda cartoons for the U s army equals private

100
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.400
Snafu,
which was very popular among the new army recruits.

101
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.010
Dr Seuss wasn't the only famous names have come out of the army.
Playwrights,

102
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.150
though Chuck Jones was the director of looney tunes and he directed the Cottey

103
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:40.420
and series.
Stan Lee of marvel comics was also one of the playwrights.

104
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.750
Ted guys all wrote and directed several propaganda films,

105
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.620
including ones that were called your job in Germany and do your job in Japan.

106
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.310
At the time,

107
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.300
he was being criticized for being too sympathetic towards the enemy countries.

108
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:57.040
This off to the war was over in 1945 these movies were agitators into a feature

109
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.450
documentary called designed for death,

110
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:04.451
which eventually won an academy award in 1947 he took advantage of this public

111
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:09.200
recognition by publishing another children's book called Maca Ella God's pool,

112
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.390
which was his first book in seven years.

113
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.890
In 1950 Geisel wrote an animated short story called Gerald Mack boing boing,

114
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:18.800
and it won the Academy Award for best animated film.
After wedding.

115
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.350
These two Oscars.
He did what most people do in Hollywood,

116
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:26.351
which was write a full length screenplay calls for 5,000 fingers of Dr t in 1953

117
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.800
the movie is a live action musical about a young boy who's piano teacher is an

118
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.680
evil villain on kidnapping children and forcing them to play his giant piano

119
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.570
forever.
In the first draft of the movie,

120
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.480
the entire story played out very much like his books.

121
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.230
He also wrote songs that made the movie fast paced and exciting bars.

122
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:48.710
Everything went downhill when the Hollywood executives pushed back saying that

123
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.370
the movie needed an adult love and dressed and drugs risen for the benefit of

124
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:54.230
parents.
Therefore,
they can't.

125
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:56.600
Half of his songs and Tartar second screen writes up.

126
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.080
The revisions ruins the story,
ends it flops in the box office.

127
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.250
If you watch the movie,

128
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.210
it's easy to spot the very funny and crazy moments there isn't by Dr Seuss mixed

129
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:09.350
with the traditional Hollywood drama that made the movie drag on forever today,

130
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:10.220
5,000 fingers.

131
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.030
It's become a cult classic because it's so terrible that it's actually kind of

132
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.810
good.
Ted guys all said that it was the biggest failure of his career,

133
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.500
that he would never trust executives to make another movie again.

134
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.950
<v 0>Off to taking a long break from writing new books.</v>

136
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:33.520
Ted Guys all learned that children's literacy rates in the United States were

137
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:37.600
dramatically low,
so he decided that he was going to do something about that.

138
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.860
This is when he wrote the cat in the hat and it was published in 1957 when he

139
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.120
was 53 years old.

140
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.360
He purposefully wrote the book with a very simple 225 word vocabulary to ensure

141
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.120
that nearly every elementary school child was able to read it.

142
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.650
This book exploded in popularity and it truly did help increase children's

143
00:07:56.651 --> 00:07:57.520
literacy rates.

144
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.290
By 1960 it's sold over a million copies and parents were now searching for more

145
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:06.040
doctor Seuss books that had been published in the past.
One of guys,

146
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.940
those friends gave them the challenge of reducing the vocabulary down to a mere

147
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:14.680
50 words and he accepted.
This is when he wrote green eggs and ham,

148
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:17.590
which was equally as successful as the cat in the hat.

149
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.760
He proved that writing doesn't have to be about showing off a big vocabulary.

150
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.790
The important thing is to tell a good story and he was a genius at doing just

151
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:27.520
that.

152
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.050
Guys will be getting ahead of children's literature at Random House and edited

153
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.710
his own books as well as contributing to the popular Berenstein bears series.

154
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.800
Now the guys who was in charge,
he made the new goal of random houses,

155
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:42.610
children's book department to make the stories as simple as possible so that

156
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:46.840
children would understand every word and enjoy reading the book instead of

157
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:50.860
struggling this way it would improve children's literacy because they would feel

158
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.010
good about the experience and crave reading more books.

159
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.050
A lot of famous authors to be a part of this project including Charlie and the

160
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:59.130
chocolate factory author,

161
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.870
Roald Dahl and even breakfast at Tiffany's author treatment capacity.

162
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.100
They both tried to pitch manuscripts to Geisel,

163
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.980
but even though they were both amazing writers in their own rights,

164
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:08.940
their children's books,

165
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:12.120
they were rejected for not fully understanding the simplicity.

166
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.630
The guys who was looking for guys all started working seven days a week,

167
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:20.400
writing and illustrating and published at least one new doctor Seuss book every

168
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.840
single year.
The story seems simple,

169
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.230
but he once said that he wrote over a thousand pages before we could narrow the

170
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.560
story down to just 60 over the course of his lifetime,

171
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.860
he authored and coauthored 66 books

172
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.871
throughout his life.

173
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:43.550
Ted Geisel got to enjoy the success of having a superstar pen name without the

174
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.460
annoying and invasive parts of being a celebrity,

175
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.180
even though his picture was in newspapers across the country and he received

176
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:51.920
over a thousand fan letters a day.

177
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.310
Very few children actually knew what the real doctors use looked like,

178
00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:59.150
so he could still blend into society without drawing a lot of attention to

179
00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:02.240
himself,
a cocktail parties in New York and Los Angeles.

180
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:04.880
Ted was worried that people would expect a lot of him,

181
00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:06.500
so he would tell elaborate stories,

182
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:11.060
but only speak to one or two people before retreating into another room to read,

183
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.270
smoke,
or have a quiet conversation.
Even though it was quiet,

184
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.240
he was always playing jokes.
Whenever an adult asked for his autograph,

185
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.810
he would write a long and elaborate fake name in the book and hand it back to

186
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:22.100
them.
He was an introvert,

187
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:26.360
so socializing more amount in general and he was always afraid that his true

188
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:26.810
self,

189
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.810
Ted Geisel was an incredibly boring person compared to the whimsical persona of

190
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.440
Dr Seuss.
On the contrary,

191
00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:36.080
friends said that they believe that the select few people,

192
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:37.110
he chose to speak to you.

193
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:40.790
We're incredibly lucky and everyone thought he was very interesting.

194
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.710
He just didn't believe in himself.

195
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.610
You would think that for a man who raped children's mercy would have loved being

196
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:47.241
around kids,

197
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:50.750
but the truth is that he often felt uncomfortable around children and said that

198
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.790
that just like socializing with adults,

199
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:56.330
I'm a great while others can be real jacks and he could only handle it for short

200
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.880
periods of time,
but he had to learn to cope,

201
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:03.050
especially when stories like the cat in the hat became popular and his agents

202
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:05.840
encouraged him to go on a book top.
Once I'm at a shopping mall,

203
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.610
he slipped away from the crowd of children and started playing pranks on mall

204
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.810
employees by altering the displays.

205
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.080
His agents actually caught him changing the prices of designer shoes to make

206
00:11:15.081 --> 00:11:16.130
them less expensive.

207
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.820
Ted did not want to disappoint the kids though because he knew that when

208
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:24.260
children imagine Dr [inaudible],
they expected to see someone now to Coupeville.

209
00:11:24.261 --> 00:11:28.160
This he was just a normal guy after a few awkward speeches,
elementary school,

210
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.210
so he decided to stop being himself and acts like Dr Seuss.

211
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.450
He started speaking and sing song the rhymes that he wrote ahead of time and

212
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.210
thought of clever answers to frequently asked questions.

213
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.020
After we started essentially playing a character,
he felt far more comfortable,

214
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.320
even though Dr Seuss wrote children's stories that we're loved around the world,

215
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:47.960
his personal life was far more complicated.

216
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.560
The story of the woman he fell in love with became one of the main scandals of

217
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:53.740
his life.
That's in order to the whole story,

218
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:56.590
we need to go all the way back in time to his college years.

219
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.330
While he was a students at Oxford.

220
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.170
Ted Geisel met a fellow American English major named Helen Palmer.

221
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.470
She was five years older than he was and almost ready to graduate with a

222
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:06.310
master's degree.

223
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.090
She's not behind Ted in class and when she saw his sketches of animals,

224
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:13.000
she encouraged him to become an artist instead of a professor.

225
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.060
He dropped out after spending just one semester in Oxford,

226
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.860
but how then went onto graduate.

227
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.470
They got married soon after and moved to New York City together.

228
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.160
She would eventually go on to publish several children's books of her own for

229
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:27.940
the majority of their marriage and Ted had a very happy relationship and so they

230
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:31.060
were very supportive of one another's works.
As a young girl,

231
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:33.640
Helen Sylvania of having polio because of her poor health,

232
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.160
she was not able to have children of our own.
However,

233
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:38.470
they enjoy the freedom of not having children.

234
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.050
He and Helen traveled to 30 different countries together.

235
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.510
They're in zones or purchase their dream home in San Diego,
California,
Rinse.

236
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.760
They even had a watch tower on top of a mountain.
Helen would edit his work,

237
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.300
giving feedback and we'll say taking care of the household well tend to act in

238
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.490
his office.
For a long time,
that marriage,

239
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.380
it was pretty perfect in 1954 just a year off to his Hollywood movie flops.

240
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:01.990
Helen was diagnosed with [inaudible] boss and drink,

241
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.380
which is an incredibly painful condition where the body's immune system attacks

242
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:06.220
is there nuts.

243
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.300
She became completely paralyzed and was placed inside of an iron lung.

244
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.670
If she were to leave this huge metal container,

245
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.240
Helen wouldn't have been able to breathe on her own for a while and they thought

246
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:19.270
that she might die.
Dead guys will stopped writing and illustrating,

247
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:23.980
completely giving up everything in his life to be by his side.
Even today,

248
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.740
there is still no cure for [inaudible] Barre Syndrome.

249
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.160
How long has to go through intensive therapy to learn to walk and talk again,

250
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.100
but she continued to be very sick without much recovery time in between to make

251
00:13:34.101 --> 00:13:34.781
it not as worse.

252
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:39.580
She was eventually diagnosed with terminal cancer like anyone who's feeling ill,

253
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:42.280
Helen was no longer acting like our usual self.

254
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.180
They started sleeping in separate bedrooms in that relationship became more of a

255
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:47.630
friendship.
Ted when zones,

256
00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:51.040
I have a secret affair with a married woman named Audrey demand who was

257
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:52.660
neighbors and friends with the couple,

258
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.080
even though he had fallen in love with someone else,
he never left his wife,

259
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.700
but when Helen was 69 years old,

260
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:01.480
she found out about the affair and she couldn't handle the possibility that he

261
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:02.230
may leave her.

262
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.400
She felt that she was 40 olds and Dell's to start her life over and tried to

263
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:07.510
move on with someone else.

264
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.870
In 1967 she killed herself leaving a suicide notes that was just as lyrical as

265
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.320
their children's books.

266
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.970
Helen died of a drug overdose and tad was completely beside himself with guilt

267
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.820
and grief.
He blames himself a death and sad.

268
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.070
I didn't know whether to kill myself,

269
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.940
burn the house down or just go away and get lost.

270
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.690
Audrey stone demand divorced her husbands and as they got married that following

271
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:34.530
year,
Audrey was 18 years younger than Geisel.

272
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.960
Then she had two daughters who are nine and 14 at that time.

273
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.650
She sent them to boarding school because she knew that they were unhappy about

274
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:42.370
the divorce.

275
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.210
The entire community judged Audrey and Ted harshly and as they were shunned by

276
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:49.840
many of their friends and neighbors because they blamed them for Helen's death,

277
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.950
Audrey and Ted,

278
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.980
they stayed together until his death and he credited her with helping him find

279
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:58.880
his love for writing again and having a chance at a second life for the first

280
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.840
time he got to experience being a stepfather and to grandfather.

281
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.920
He wrote sometimes when I see my granddaughters make small discoveries of their

282
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.080
own,
I wish I were a child

283
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.530
in 1984 Ted guys,

284
00:15:16.531 --> 00:15:19.740
they'll won the Pulitzer Prize in children's literature and his stories were

285
00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:21.810
translated into 30 languages.

286
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.950
Doctors use is now considered to be a classic author who is towards to each new

287
00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:29.460
generation and his books continue to be reprinted.
Today.

288
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.930
Theodor Geisel was diagnosed with mouth cancer from beers of smoking and he died

289
00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:37.380
in 1991 in the age of 87 three weeks before his death.

290
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.340
He asked for a bed to be moved into his office so that he could be surrounded by

291
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.420
the sketches and sculptures of his characters and have a view of the mountains

292
00:15:45.421 --> 00:15:47.490
from his picture window when he was alive.

293
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.510
Ted guys all did not want any merchandise or movies to be made from his books.

294
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.890
However,
after he died,
his wife Audrey became in charge of this use brands.

295
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.290
She chose to allow licensing to make toys,

296
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:02.070
games and Hollywood films so long as she was there to oversee the creative

297
00:16:02.071 --> 00:16:05.070
direction and make sure that it would have been up to ted standards.

298
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.280
Some people have criticized,
I've saying that it's exploitation,

299
00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:12.030
but she believes that in today's ever changing world of children's media,

300
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.680
the Dr Seuss stories may have not lasted as long as they have if they didn't get

301
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.570
a modern makeover.
Audrey,

302
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.080
she was right and how decisions have helped keep his legacy alive.
Yeah.

303
00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:26.250
Pads on the 2018 Forbes list of richest dead celebrities.

304
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.310
His book sold 4.8 million copies and and $16 million in 2017 alone because the

305
00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:36.150
state is currently worth around $75 million.

306
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.840
She gives her a huge portion of the proceeds from our husbands royalties to the

307
00:16:39.841 --> 00:16:40.980
doctors use foundation,

308
00:16:40.981 --> 00:16:44.550
which is a nonprofit organization that donates money to various causes.

309
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.000
So all of the money from these new doctors use movie remakes of actually going

310
00:16:48.001 --> 00:16:51.660
to pay for college scholarships,
libraries,
school art programs,

311
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.980
and cancer research.

312
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:57.210
Surely had Geisel would be happy to know that even years after his death,

313
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.170
his stories are still making a difference with children everywhere.

314
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.810
So I really hope you found that video.
