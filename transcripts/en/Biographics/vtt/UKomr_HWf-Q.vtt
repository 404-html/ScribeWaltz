<v Speaker 1>As the founder of Playboy magazine who half?</v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:02.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the icons of the sexual revolution in the 1960s.</v>

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Opinions about half now are very polarized,</v>

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>either love and admire the man who you completely disapprove of,</v>

6
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>the multimillion dollar empire that he created.</v>

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>But no matter how you feel about Hugh Hefner,</v>

8
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>there is no arguing that he was truly a genius when it came to business.</v>

9
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

10
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.121
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the kinds publisher,</v>

12
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>writer and is on trapping now,</v>

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Hugh Austin half note was born in Chicago in 1926.</v>

14
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>He grew up in the middle of prohibition on his parents were conservative</v>

15
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Methodists.</v>

16
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>His mother was a teacher and his father was an accountant during the Great</v>

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.281
<v Speaker 1>Depression.</v>

18
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.150
<v Speaker 1>His father was under a lot of pressure to work as hard as he possibly could in</v>

19
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>order to keep his job.</v>

20
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>He would leave the house before Hugh and his brother key if even woke up for</v>

21
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>school and he works late into the night.</v>

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>He was a very timid and shy Ellis or why he preferred to read comic books and</v>

23
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.143
<v Speaker 1>watch movies.</v>

24
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Most of the Hollywood starlets in the 1920s and thirties just happened to be</v>

25
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>buxom blonde girls with an hourglass figure,</v>

26
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>and so you grew up escaping into a fantasy world of romance and adventure,</v>

27
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>wishing that he could live inside these movies.</v>

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>In elementary school you did not talk very much and he didn't seem to be paying</v>

29
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>attention to class.</v>

30
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>He spent most of his time drawing in his notebooks with his mind ends up in the</v>

31
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>clouds.</v>

32
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It was unresponsive to his just questions as well,</v>

33
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>so they thought that he might have some sort of a learning disability.</v>

34
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>His mother took him to a child psychologist and it turns out that he had an Iq</v>

35
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>of 152 which makes them a genius.</v>

36
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>The reality was that he was simply bored with what he was learning in class.</v>

37
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>When he started going to high school,</v>

38
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>he had his heartbroken when a girl he had a crush on started dating another boy,</v>

39
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>and at this point he was still shy,</v>

40
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>ended trouble communicating,</v>

41
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but the perceived rejection from this gal was a wake up call.</v>

42
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.401
<v Speaker 1>From that moment on,</v>

43
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>he realized that he needed to reinvent himself if he ever wanted to get a</v>

44
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:02.324
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>

45
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>He asked his friends to start calling him half instead of humans.</v>

46
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>He began to wear nicer clothes,</v>

47
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Cologne and stylists hat underneath all of these outward improvements.</v>

48
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:11.511
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

49
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>he was still that hardcore film that he wrote plays for the theater department</v>

50
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and he films his own horror movies with a home video camera with his friends.</v>

51
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>He worked on the school newspaper and drew comic books in his spare time.</v>

52
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>When he was 15 he created his own xen,</v>

53
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>but he had fully illustrated and he calls it shutter.</v>

54
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 1>He wrote articles about horror movies.</v>

56
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>He mess up with a group of friends after school calls the shutter club where</v>

57
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>they got together to watch films and talk about them.</v>

58
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that he finally came out of his shell and he was popular</v>

59
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:44.861
<v Speaker 1>enough to be elected student body president from 1944 to 1946 you have not</v>

60
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>served in the U s army.</v>

61
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>He used his talents in writing to work in the military.</v>

62
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.563
<v Speaker 1>His newspaper,</v>

63
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>since he did not have a combat position,</v>

64
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>be lived out the adventures in his mind by drawing comic books about fantasy</v>

65
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>versions like one way here in a of his friends were breaking prisoners out of a</v>

66
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Nazi concentration camp during World War Two illustrations and photos of pinup</v>

67
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>girls were extremely popular in order to boost soldiers' morale that were even</v>

68
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.060
<v Speaker 1>paintings of Miss America on the sides of airplanes,</v>

69
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>bombers instead of staring at scantily clad strangers in his bunk,</v>

70
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>you have now gazed at photos and letters from his fiance,</v>

71
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Miljard Williams.</v>

72
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>He was very much in love with her and the plans again married when the war was</v>

73
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

74
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.280
<v Speaker 1>After being discharged from the army,</v>

75
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>you have no end to the University of Illinois and double majored in psychology</v>

76

<v Speaker 1>and creative writing.</v>

77
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>He excelled in school and he was able to earn his bachelor's degree in just two</v>

78
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>and a half years.</v>

79
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>He also wrote for the College newspaper and magazine.</v>

80
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>He was eager to marry Mildred after graduation,</v>

81
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that he was getting to live out the plot of a Hollywood romance</v>

82
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>when it came crashing down before the wedding,</v>

83
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Mildred confessed that she had had an affair when he was away in the army.</v>

84
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>He forgave her though and he lost his virginity on his wedding night.</v>

85
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>They went on to have two children together,</v>

86
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Christine and David.</v>

87
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>He was very much in love with Mildred and even though it broke his heart,</v>

88
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>he believed in the old traditional way of doing things.</v>

89
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>During an interview with the New York Times,</v>

90
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>having to explained how he felt on his wedding day,</v>

91
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>the magic was gone from the very beginning.</v>

92
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>How would it have turned out without the affair was like well suited for</v>

93
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

94
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know boss.</v>

95
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I was truly crushed</v>

96
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.580
<v Speaker 1>after serving in the army and graduating from college who have not got a job at</v>

97
00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Esquire magazine,</v>

98
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>making $60 a week with modern day inflation.</v>

99
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.050
<v Speaker 1>That's about $645 a week after working there for several years.</v>

100
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Half of the knew that he was good at his job,</v>

101
00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:37.430
<v Speaker 1>so he asked his boss for a $5 a week raise.</v>

102
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't sound like a lot to ask,</v>

103
00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 1>but they still said no.</v>

104
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 1>At this point he was starting to have a bit of a quarter life crisis.</v>

105
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing last point.</v>

106
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>He had followed all of the rules of living the so called American dream that he</v>

107
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.440
<v Speaker 1>was unhappy with his job and he was in an unfaithful marriage.</v>

108
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.530
<v Speaker 1>He decided that he truly had nothing left to lose,</v>

109
00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 1>so he quit his job and worked on starting his own magazine.</v>

110
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.610
<v Speaker 1>You have no knew from being in the army that men love looking at pictures of</v>

111
00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:02.444
<v Speaker 1>pinup girls.</v>

112
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 1>When they came home from the war,</v>

113
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 1>many men did not have access to it anymore because it was illegal to send</v>

114
00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 1>anything that was considered pornographic in the mail and that's how I men's</v>

115
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.530
<v Speaker 1>magazines were mostly about hunting,</v>

116
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 1>fishing,</v>

117
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.401
<v Speaker 1>camping,</v>

118
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and cause have not sold.</v>

119
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a golden opportunity to start his own publication.</v>

120
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.730
<v Speaker 1>The only issue was that he was completely broke.</v>

121
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.620
<v Speaker 1>You borrowed $1,000 from his mother,</v>

122
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.240
<v Speaker 1>mortgaged out his furniture to the bank for $600 and convinced several investors</v>

123
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>to help him raise a total of $8,000 to get the first issue of playboy started.</v>

124
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 1>At first he thought about naming the magazine's stag party.</v>

125
00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>You just decided against it.</v>

126
00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Since there was already a magazine called Stag,</v>

127
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.150
<v Speaker 1>you have no was able to by Marilyn Monroe's nude photos from accounting's as a</v>

128
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>company who owned the rights.</v>

129
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 1>These photographs were famous,</v>

130
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 1>but since this was decades before people could easily share is on the Internet.</v>

131
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Very few people that actually seen them for just $200 he bought the rights to</v>

132
00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the pictures and published them in the very first issue of playboy Zinn's.</v>

133
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Marilyn Monro was of the biggest celebrities of the time.</v>

134
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.890
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't have picked a better woman to place on the cover.</v>

135
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Magazines were flying off the shelves and they sold 50,000 copies.</v>

136
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>The money they made from that issue was just enough to make the seconds and</v>

137
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>after a few months they were turning a profit.</v>

138
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>It soon enough they were selling over a million copies a month and playboy was</v>

139
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>essentially an overnight success.</v>

140
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.961
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

141
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a joke when people say they read playboy for the articles,</v>

142
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's actually a lot of truth to that statement.</v>

143
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Hugh Hefner was always against censorship in the media andZ ran one of the very</v>

144
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 1>few publications where writers get to express themselves without holding back.</v>

145
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Some of the greatest authors in the world actually got their start writing for</v>

146
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>playboy.</v>

147
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Ian Fleming was one of them and he went on to write James Bond's and ray</v>

148
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Bradbury serialized chapters of Fahrenheit four five one in the magazine before</v>

149
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>publishing the complete novel.</v>

150
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Even Margaret Atwood published several short stories in playboy before writing</v>

151
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>our feminist dystopian novel.</v>

152
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>The Handmaid's tale in the 1950s you have not was defying all rational</v>

153
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:59.891
<v Speaker 1>convention and actually promoted feminism and women's sexual liberation as well</v>

154
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>as racial equality.</v>

155
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>In 1959 a series called playboys penthouse ad on the television.</v>

156
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>For the first time,</v>

157
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>women were shown on TV as more than just housewives who were staying home to</v>

158
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>make a dinner and take care of the children.</v>

159
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>The premise of the show was that the viewer followed around half an hour as he</v>

160
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>had to classy party in his penthouse apartment.</v>

161
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Women Wa elegant dresses and men wore suits as they drank cocktails and had</v>

162
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>interesting conversations while they listen to live jazz music.</v>

163
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>It was sophisticated and that lifestyle became an aspiration for many men and</v>

164
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 1>women who watched the series.</v>

165
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Now at this point,</v>

166
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to his marriage,</v>

167
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>it was crumbling and he and his wife,</v>

168
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Mildred had agreed to allow one another to sleep with different people.</v>

169
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>They officially called it quits in 1959 and got a divorce,</v>

170
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>which left him free to live the bachelor lifestyle to match the playboy brand.</v>

171
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 1>That same year,</v>

172
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>he bought his first a mansion and opens the playboy club in Chicago.</v>

173
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

174
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>he would open dozens of clubs all over the country so that men could experience</v>

175
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the playboy and penthouse lifestyle firsthand.</v>

176
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>By the time he turned 35 the play by empire had expanded to a lifestyle brand</v>

177
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>worth $20 million.</v>

178
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>As time winds on the magazine would come to be published in over 180 countries</v>

179
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>and it became one of the top 20 brands in the entire world,</v>

180
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>right wing conservatives.</v>

181
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>They were against playboy from the very first issue because they considered the</v>

182
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>magazine to be sinful trash.</v>

183
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>He also gone a lot of criticism from the left as well because feminists saw that</v>

184
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>it was objectifying and over sexualizing women rather than liberating them.</v>

185
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>After receiving so much criticism who haven't published a book called the</v>

186
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:43.451
<v Speaker 1>playboy philosophy in 1962 where are you explains his ideas about sex in modern</v>

187
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>culture and attends to explain his thought process behind you're running the</v>

188
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

189
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>In 1963 a journalist named Gloria Steinem went undercover for showing magazines</v>

190
00:08:53.191 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 1>at work as a waitress and one of the playboy clubs.</v>

191
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>She found out that these girls were being underpaid and as they were charged</v>

192
00:08:59.131 --> 00:08:59.461
<v Speaker 1>fees,</v>

193
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:00.350
<v Speaker 1>whenever they committed,</v>

194
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.820
<v Speaker 1>even the smallest infractions,</v>

195
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>like not smiling enough,</v>

196
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>they were also being treated very badly by the customers.</v>

197
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.081
<v Speaker 1>And in the ends,</v>

198
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>women hardly made any money in order to be sexually objectified.</v>

199
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Clients were given special keys that allowed them to have total access to the</v>

200
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>playboy bunnies,</v>

201
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:16.370
<v Speaker 1>which needs the club.</v>

202
00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>A glorified brothel.</v>

203
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Steinem wrote about her experiences and she was seen as a hero for feminism by</v>

204
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>exposing what was going on behind closed doors.</v>

205
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.111
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

206
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:25.651
<v Speaker 1>Hugh Hefner,</v>

207
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>he took this criticism seriously and responded by making sure that the women</v>

208
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 1>working in his clubs,</v>

209
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>they were being treated fairly and being paid a proper wage.</v>

210
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>But as they say,</v>

211
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 1>even bad press is good press.</v>

212
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And despite all of the controversy,</v>

213
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the playboy brand continue to thrive</v>

214
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:47.801
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

215
00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:51.730
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to imagine playboy and without the mansion filled with beautiful</v>

216
00:09:51.731 --> 00:09:52.121
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tennis courts,</v>

222
00:10:02.651 --> 00:10:04.720
<v Speaker 1>and even a zoo with exotic animals.</v>

223
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.650
<v Speaker 1>You have not began hosting at some of the biggest parties in history of the</v>

224
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Speaker 1>playboy mansion with celebrity guests visiting on a regular basis.</v>

225
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.020
<v Speaker 1>He was still the most popular guy around even well into his old age in the year</v>

<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles gave him a star on the celebrity walk,</v>

228

<v Speaker 1>a thin as a thank you gift.</v>

229
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And the 1980s playboy began to struggle as a brand.</v>

230
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.270
<v Speaker 1>After it became a publicly shared cooperation,</v>

231
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.190
<v Speaker 1>they were competing with the likes of Penthouse magazine.</v>

232
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.220
<v Speaker 1>So that peak in popularity was over.</v>

233
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>You have now handed control of the company over to his daughter,</v>

234
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.671
<v Speaker 1>Christie,</v>

235
00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:41.080
<v Speaker 1>who became the new CEO,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he got married to his second wife,</v>

238
00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Kimberly Conrad.</v>

239
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.480
<v Speaker 1>In 1989 she gave birth to two sons,</v>

240
00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Maston and Cuba.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That relationship didn't last though,</v>

244
00:10:56.711 --> 00:11:01.630
<v Speaker 1>and they separated in 1988 and became officially divorced in 2010 after the</v>

245
00:11:01.631 --> 00:11:02.231
<v Speaker 1>separation,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you haven't to began to invite his girlfriend's to live in the house with him</v>

247
00:11:05.351 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 1>and even experimented with bisexuality.</v>

248
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.040
<v Speaker 1>He had a polyamorous lifestyle where he had multiple girlfriends at one time,</v>

249
00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:15.430
<v Speaker 1>but always had a number one girl by a site.</v>

250
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.900
<v Speaker 1>He knows you're admitted that he had slept with roughly 11 out of the 12 monthly</v>

252
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Carrie Lee said that living in the playboy mansion was almost like a cult</v>

253
00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:31.300
<v Speaker 1>because it was so easy to get caught up in the lifestyle and the drama with the</v>

254
00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:32.350
<v Speaker 1>multiple girlfriends.</v>

255
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 1>She got so caught up in the playboy lifestyle that she forgot what was</v>

256
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:37.390
<v Speaker 1>considered normal in the outside world.</v>

257
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.080
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

258
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>unlike a real cults,</v>

259
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the girls living in the house were free to come and go as they pleased.</v>

260
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.700
<v Speaker 1>They still have that own personal relationships and kept in touch with their</v>

261
00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:46.450
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

262
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Some of them even went to college classes full or part time and their work with</v>

263
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.510
<v Speaker 1>playboy helps them pay for that tuition.</v>

264
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>In two and five the reality TV series,</v>

<v Speaker 1>girls next door premiered and it gives people a look into the lives of the</v>

266
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:00.730

<v Speaker 1>It reveals new Heffernan's new lifestyle with a team of employees to take care</v>

268
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 1>of all of his needs.</v>

269
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.700
<v Speaker 1>The girls he lived with were also given an allowance to buy whatever they want</v>

270
00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:09.160
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

271
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.551

<v Speaker 1>whoever he wants it,</v>

275
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>but the girls were not allowed to have another friends.</v>

276
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Even though this may seem like a dream scenario for some men,</v>

277
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 1>the arrangement was not always a walk in the park for half an hour.</v>

278
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Some of the women who once lived with him sued him for palimony after that</v>

279
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>breakup,</v>

280
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 1>which is like Alan for people who are living together,</v>

281
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but we were not married during an interview.</v>

282
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>One of half of his ex girlfriends,</v>

283
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.211
<v Speaker 1>Holly Madison,</v>

284
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>explains that women were competing with one another for the privilege of being</v>

285
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>in Hugh Hefner's in a circle,</v>

286
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 1>dozens of small town goals which see their careers skyrocket after modeling in</v>

287
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.120
<v Speaker 1>playboy and they were desperate to become a part of it.</v>

288
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Almost every girl who was involved with the brands moved on to either having a</v>

289
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:56.910
<v Speaker 1>big modeling career or marrying a millionaire because I'm having sex with you</v>

290
00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 1>half know it was a very small price to pay for guaranteed fame and fortune.</v>

291
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 1>As he got older,</v>

292
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you have no new batter than to expect any of these young women to be as true</v>

293
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:05.800
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

294
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>He said during an interview with the New York Times that having seven</v>

295
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends was actually a much easier lifestyle to manage than having just one</v>

296
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>wife in 2012 he was 86 years old and he decided that it was finally time to</v>

297
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:18.784
<v Speaker 1>settle down.</v>

298
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.200
<v Speaker 1>He married Crystal Harris,</v>

299
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 1>who was just 26 on the reality TV show.</v>

300
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:23.861
<v Speaker 1>Girls next door.</v>

301
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:24.810
<v Speaker 1>He was girlfriends,</v>

302
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>showed off their happy lifestyles living in the playboy mansion,</v>

303
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but Holly Madison came out with a tell all book in 2015 saying that she had</v>

304
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:35.890
<v Speaker 1>actually been manipulated into staying with you half an hour for so many years.</v>

305
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>She said that she was truly in love with him at first,</v>

306
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 1>but when she finally got the exclusive relationship that she was looking for,</v>

307
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>she was no longer in love with him.</v>

308
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 1>She eventually married a millionaire event organizer or Pascal Rotella.</v>

309
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 1>You have to respond to to Madison's accusations in her book saying it was an</v>

310
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:55.390
<v Speaker 1>attempt to do rewrite history for the sake of staying relevant in the media and</v>

311
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.980
<v Speaker 1>making money on a book deal.</v>

312
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And 2016 it was clear that he has in his health was declining,</v>

313
00:14:06.831 --> 00:14:11.450
<v Speaker 1>so he decided to sell his mansion in Los Angeles for $100 million to a man named</v>

314
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.281
<v Speaker 1>Darren Metropole.</v>

315
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:14.300
<v Speaker 1>This in 2018 which are Polis,</v>

316
00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:18.020
<v Speaker 1>convinced the city of Los Angeles to add protections to the house so that it can</v>

317
00:14:18.021 --> 00:14:19.040
<v Speaker 1>never be torn down.</v>

318
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>The playboy mansion has essentially been turned into a historical landmark if</v>

319
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you have not died peacefully in September of 2017 surrounded by his friends and</v>

320
00:14:28.011 --> 00:14:30.020
<v Speaker 1>family when he was 91 years old.</v>

321
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Even though he never got to meet Marilyn Monroe,</v>

322
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:35.510
<v Speaker 1>he's still accredited her nudes for all of his success.</v>

323
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 1>This is why he punches the burial plot right next to hers.</v>

324
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Love him or hate him.</v>

325
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.450
<v Speaker 1>You have no,</v>

326
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.320
<v Speaker 1>it's still an icon that will be remembered forever before he passed away.</v>

327
00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:46.790
<v Speaker 1>He said this about his career.</v>

328
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.410
<v Speaker 1>I've never been in it for the money.</v>

329
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Playboy isn't a business for me.</v>

330
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>It has been the very beginning,</v>

331
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 1>a labor of love,</v>

332
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty easy to say because if you don't love all of this,</v>

333
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.783
<v Speaker 1>you're a fool.</v>
