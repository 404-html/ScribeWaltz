00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.341
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2
00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.840
<v Speaker 1>just before we get cracking with today's video,</v>

3
00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I got to say there's a lot of Russian pronunciations in here.</v>

4
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I am looking them up when I can,</v>

5
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but I don't always get them a hundred percent right.</v>

6
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I apologize ahead of time if you want to have a go at me.</v>

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>that's what the comments are for.</v>

9
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

10
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:14.254
<v Speaker 1>Let's crack on.</v>

12
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>During the Bolshevik revolution,</v>

13
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>the Romanov Dynasty was killed off to over a 100 year reign of Russia.</v>

14
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.820
<v Speaker 1>The bodies of the parents and all five children were laid out on the grounds,</v>

15
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but when the corpses were later moved and given a proper burial,</v>

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>the bodies of the sun,</v>

17
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Alexi and the Princess Anastasia,</v>

18
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>we're missing this,</v>

19
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>gave the Russian people hope that at least two of these innocent children</v>

20
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>managed to play dead long enough in order to escape.</v>

21
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Several years later,</v>

22
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>a young woman was admitted to a mental hospital in Germany.</v>

23
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>There were skulls all over her body and she clearly suffered some traumatic</v>

24
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:47.351
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

25
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>but her mind to block out the painful memories.</v>

26
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't even remember her name.</v>

27
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>The only clue about where she came from was the fact that she spoke with a</v>

28
00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Russian accent.</v>

29
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Months later,</v>

30
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>a Russian patient was admitted to that same hospital and she immediately began</v>

31
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>to kneel in front of this young girl.</v>

32
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>She claims that she recognized her as the missing Princess Anastasia,</v>

33
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>but who was this young woman?</v>

34
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Was she really the long lost princess or would this go down as one of the</v>

35
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.450
<v Speaker 1>biggest frauds in all of history?</v>

36
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia Romanov was born in 19.</v>

37
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:30.881
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

38
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.081
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

39
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:31.831
<v Speaker 1>two saw Nicholas.</v>

40
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:32.401
<v Speaker 1>The second one,</v>

41
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>his wife saw rina,</v>

42
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Alexandra theater,</v>

43
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>rovner.</v>

44
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I propertycapsule it was grand duchess best.</v>

45
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>No one ever addressed the young girl with this proper title in her daily life.</v>

46
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>She had three older sisters,</v>

47
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:43.261
<v Speaker 1>Olga,</v>

48
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:43.651
<v Speaker 1>Maria,</v>

49
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:44.484
<v Speaker 1>and Tatiana.</v>

50
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.181
<v Speaker 1>Her younger brother,</v>

51
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Alexia was meant to ascend to the throne someday.</v>

52
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>The Romanov children were the first royals to have such an extensive collection</v>

53
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>of family photographs.</v>

54
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>There are hundreds of pictures and videos of their family vacations and them</v>

55
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>playing games on the palace grounds.</v>

56
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>It was easy to see that they live a carefree life.</v>

57
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Their pictures were publicized all over Russia and they became the darlings of</v>

58
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

59
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia was an extremely energetic toddler who had a bubbly personality.</v>

60
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>She was very intelligent,</v>

61
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>so she grew bored of our tutors lessons very quickly.</v>

62
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>She was a tomboy and she enjoyed playing outside far more than doing ladylike</v>

63
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>activities with her sisters.</v>

64
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>She was described as clumsy and was always climbing on something or running</v>

65
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>around somewhere.</v>

66
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>She seemed to have an endless amounts of energy according to some of our cousins</v>

67
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>and ladies in waiting Anastasia's board and manifested in some terrible ways.</v>

68
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>She would entertain herself by playing pranks on people and to our cousins</v>

69
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>called evil.</v>

70
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>In one of the servants' quarter a terrorist,</v>

71
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>she tripped on a servants in the hallway,</v>

72
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>climbed up trees,</v>

73
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>and refused to come down and hit rocks inside of snowballs.</v>

74
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>She would often cheat during games and she lied a lot to get herself out of</v>

75
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

76
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>At one sign,</v>

77
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>a monk named gregory rest.</v>

78
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Pinkston became the spiritual advisor of the Romanov family.</v>

79
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.551
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

80
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:58.321
<v Speaker 1>Inner Alexandra.</v>

81
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I whole heartedly that he had magical powers that heals,</v>

82
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.421
<v Speaker 1>had a son,</v>

83
00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:02.921
<v Speaker 1>Alexi,</v>

84
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>who was suffering from hemophilia respiration,</v>

85
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>was able to heal him from the brink of death because of this,</v>

86
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>she listened to his advice and gave him free rein in the royal palace,</v>

87
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.511
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia,</v>

88
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>that may or may not have realized it,</v>

89
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>but her father Nicholas had a problem with drugs and one of his diary entries he</v>

90
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>wrote about waking up with a stuffy nose and planning to fix it by snorting</v>

91
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>

92
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.761
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

93
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>the cocaine was actually prescribed by doctors as medications,</v>

94
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>so it didn't hold the same stigma that it does today.</v>

95
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>While she did not take recreational drugs.</v>

96
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:33.860
<v Speaker 1>So arena Alexandra,</v>

97
00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>it was described as being anxious and high strung.</v>

98
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia commented that her mother barely ever indulged in coffee or wine</v>

99
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>because she had a bad stomach.</v>

100
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>She was also incredibly spiritual and often went to mistakes to help make</v>

101
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>decisions about day to day life.</v>

102
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin was also pretty famous for using morphine,</v>

103
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.821
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

104
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>and opium on a regular basis.</v>

105
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Some historians believe that the closer he got to the SAR and Sarina,</v>

106
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the more the couple became dependent on the drugs and guidance of the fanatical</v>

107
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>religion that Rasputin was introducing them to after witnessing the terrible</v>

108
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>things that drugs did to the adults in her life.</v>

109
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia became obsessed with clean eating and natural remedies.</v>

110
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>She spoke against drug use and became a vegetarian.</v>

111
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Every time she was sick,</v>

112
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>she would throw a fit,</v>

113
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 1>refusing to take any medication because she didn't want to be like Rasputin into</v>

114
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

115
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Sevens noted that Rasputin was given a little too much access to the children in</v>

116
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:28.901
<v Speaker 1>1910.</v>

117
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the Nannies was particularly disturbed about the fact that the monk was</v>

118
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>often witnessed with four girls when they were in their nightgowns.</v>

119
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>He had the freedom to enter the children's nursery whenever he wanted.</v>

120
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.271
<v Speaker 1>That same year.</v>

121
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>One of the other governesses claims that Rasputin raped her.</v>

122
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>She tried to tell the Sarina,</v>

123
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but sadly the Sarina was so brainwashed by recipes in that she refused to</v>

124
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>believe the government asked the girls.</v>

125
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>They were growing older.</v>

126
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>The eldest daughters were already teenagers and Anastasia was nine years old.</v>

127
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 1>One of the other servants believed the governor,</v>

128
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>the story about the rape,</v>

129
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the parents of the children who have flaunting preoccupied with their own</v>

130
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:03.701
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

131
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>so this only trying to keep [inaudible] away from the children.</v>

132
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>The girls were very naive and did not see any issue with him coming to visit</v>

133
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>them at night.</v>

134
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>They called him a friends and when they told Sardina Alexandra that the nanny</v>

135
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>was trying to keep them out of the nursery at night.</v>

136
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>She was fired according to the children in was simply visiting,</v>

137
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>do tell them bedtime stories and help them say that press back in his hometown,</v>

138
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Ras and actually did have children of his own,</v>

139
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's always possible that he was acting on fatherly instinct,</v>

140
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but its reputation of being a sexual deviance would be enough for anyone to be</v>

141
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>worried.</v>

142
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.810
<v Speaker 1>After the nanny was fired,</v>

143
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>she told everyone she knew about the story.</v>

144
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>This box of remit,</v>

145
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>that respite and had free reign to visit the princesses at night in a sexual</v>

146
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

147
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>There is no evidence that rescues and ever actually abused the Romanov children,</v>

148
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but of course we'll never really know what happens behind closed doors.</v>

149
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.641
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

150
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it was around this time that saw Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave some in</v>

151
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg when world war one first began.</v>

152
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia was only 13 years old.</v>

153
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Her mother and sisters were old enough to volunteer as nurses for the Red Cross.</v>

154
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.950
<v Speaker 1>She did her duty by playing pool and chest with the soldiers and entertained</v>

155
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>people with our wild energy and Loftin as a teenager.</v>

156
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia used her acting talents for good though what seems like mean spirited.</v>

157
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Pranks that she played in her childhood actually ended up being loved comedy.</v>

158
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Her family and members of the staff would often put on their own plays and</v>

159
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 1>performances.</v>

160
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>According to witnesses,</v>

161
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia was naturally hilarious and did everyone laughing so hard that they</v>

162
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>had peers in their eyes.</v>

163
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes she would burst out funny faces when the camera was trying to capture</v>

164
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>a candid moment of her sisters in every difficult situation.</v>

165
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia was always the one to fix it and always the one to make everyone</v>

166
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>around us smile.</v>

167
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.221
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

168
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>after the war,</v>

169
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Russia began suffering a terrible depression.</v>

170
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>People were starving,</v>

171
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>men had died during the war and people desperately needed help.</v>

172
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Many people viewed the royal family as being part of the problem,</v>

173
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>their reputation for bad decision making with Rasputin session that he didn't</v>

174
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.384
<v Speaker 1>tell Eva,</v>

175
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>and basically the short of it is the communism took hold by the time Anastasia</v>

176
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:06.441
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

177
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:06.921
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

178
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>the Romanov family was placed under house arrest by the Bolsheviks.</v>

179
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 1>The criminal family were ordered to leave.</v>

180
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Their costs were put under house arrest.</v>

181
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>They will move from place to place,</v>

182
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 1>and their last residence was a place called Patty of house.</v>

183
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Even in these dark moments,</v>

184
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia was still trying to make everyone laugh and smile.</v>

185
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It was noted that she adjusted the best to that new life of captivity.</v>

186
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.030
<v Speaker 1>One of the guards told a story of Anastasia trying to open a window for some</v>

187
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>fresh air and they shot at her to keep her from trying to escape.</v>

188
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 1>She turned to the guard and stuck her tongue out Sam's window shut and walked</v>

189
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

190
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Even in this awful situation for her,</v>

191
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 1>she was fearless at first.</v>

192
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Lennon wrote,</v>

193
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 1>the family was in captivity and promised that they were still alive.</v>

194
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.861
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

195
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>he soon realized that as long as the role deadlines still existed,</v>

196
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that would always be a chance that soldiers loyal to the Roman,</v>

197
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>obviously we'll try to overthrow him.</v>

198
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>He decided that the only way for communism to exist was to execute the entire</v>

199
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

200
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>The family was made to walk down to the basement where a group of men were</v>

201
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>ordered to shoot at them.</v>

202
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.380
<v Speaker 1>During the execution,</v>

203
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>the gunman realized that the daughters were still alive even after being shot</v>

204
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>multiple times in the chest.</v>

205
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It turns out they were wearing corsets that had been lined with Raul gemstones</v>

206
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>and this acted like a bulletproof vest.</v>

207
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>

208
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>each of the family members received a shot to the head to ensure that they</v>

209
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>actually did die.</v>

210
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

211
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.130
<v Speaker 1>some believe that these gen line course,</v>

212
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>it would've been enough for the gunmen to hesitate to kill the two youngest</v>

213
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>members of the family.</v>

214
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.151
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

215
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it's all of the older daughters were full grown women,</v>

216
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>but Anastasia and Alexa were only 13 and 16 years old.</v>

217
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>They weren't innocent children and they didn't deserve to die.</v>

218
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Many people hopes that the gods took pity on them.</v>

219
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the men in the firing squad,</v>

220
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Rudolph Laka,</v>

221
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>was originally from Austria and he was staying in as a prisoner of war as a</v>

222
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>foreigner.</v>

223
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>He had no loyalty to the imperial family and was ordered to serve the</v>

224
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>bolsheviks.</v>

225
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>He claimed that he pulled over the truck when I got stuck in the mud,</v>

226
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>he could hear a rustling in the back and when he went to check on the bodies,</v>

227
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>he discovered that Anastasia was still alive,</v>

228
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I think helped her escape.</v>

229
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.521
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

230
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>there were other quotes from her that indicated the total opposite was true.</v>

231
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He was one square to to saying that he didn't care about killing the Romanov</v>

232
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

233
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>They weren't relatives of his and he was doing his duty for the Bolsheviks,</v>

234
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but this confession was enough to spawn remiss that Anastasia had actually</v>

235
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:26.784
<v Speaker 1>escaped.</v>

236
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.201
<v Speaker 1>In 19,</v>

237
00:09:33.201 --> 00:09:33.680
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

238
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>a young woman in Berlin,</v>

239
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Germany attempted to jump off a bridge and commit suicide nearby.</v>

240
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Police officers saved her life and brought her to a mental hospital for</v>

241
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:42.020
<v Speaker 1>treatments.</v>

242
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.780
<v Speaker 1>She was beautiful and spoke with a thick Russian accent.</v>

243
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.670
<v Speaker 1>When the doctors disaster who she was,</v>

244
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:50.150
<v Speaker 1>she replied that she didn't know there were scars all over our body,</v>

245
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:54.530
<v Speaker 1>including a triangle shaped indentation in how foot and deep lacerations on her</v>

246
00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:55.280
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

247
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that she had survived some sort of horrific trauma and brain</v>

248
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.860
<v Speaker 1>completely shut down.</v>

249
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Every night she would wake up screaming to her nightmares,</v>

250
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.521
<v Speaker 1>the memories.</v>

251
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:07.790
<v Speaker 1>They were simply too painful for her to recall when she was awake,</v>

252
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but at night they seem to come to her.</v>

253
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.220
<v Speaker 1>The doctors gave her the nickname of miss.</v>

254
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.063
<v Speaker 1>Unknown.</v>

255
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.143
<v Speaker 1>Two years later,</v>

256
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.781
<v Speaker 1>this unknown,</v>

257
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>we're still living in a mental hospital in Germany when it Russian women was</v>

258
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.490
<v Speaker 1>admitted as a patient.</v>

259
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.660
<v Speaker 1>The woman was shocked and immediately kneels in front of the young women.</v>

260
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 1>She said that this was the missing princess on a stage up.</v>

261
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot unknown did not confirm or deny the statement.</v>

262
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.130
<v Speaker 1>She had no idea who she actually wasn't becoming a princess.</v>

263
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Sounded pretty fine to her.</v>

264
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.240
<v Speaker 1>So the doctor has.</v>

265
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>This actually needs a lot of sense though.</v>

266
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot unknown had clearly endured something horrific and it was the answer to a</v>

267
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:41.751
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>

268
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:43.370
<v Speaker 1>They had long been trying to solve,</v>

269
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.940
<v Speaker 1>comparing photos of both misson known and Anastasia next to one another.</v>

270
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It is easy to see why many people believe this to be true.</v>

271
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.811
<v Speaker 1>They have the same.</v>

272
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:52.430
<v Speaker 1>His nose and dies.</v>

273
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot unknown was also the same age.</v>

274
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>In 1922 newspapers began to claim that the princess had been found and her photo</v>

275
00:10:59.151 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 1>was published.</v>

276
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Friends and family of the Roman.</v>

277
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.140
<v Speaker 1>This came from all over the world to visit her.</v>

278
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>They would ask her questions that only Anastasia would know,</v>

279
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and yet somehow this woman knew many of the answers the opinion of friends and</v>

280
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:11.120
<v Speaker 1>family was divided.</v>

281
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Fifty slash 50.</v>

282
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.400
<v Speaker 1>While the case was under investigation,</v>

283
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:17.450
<v Speaker 1>she was invited to stay in castles with Rehmann off cousins and several people</v>

284
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 1>to send money to her to help her pay for our expenses and is tier to Sydney.</v>

285
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Gibbs was one of the most outspoken critics,</v>

286
00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>though he vividly remembered his student's personality,</v>

287
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.760
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much they look the same.</v>

288
00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:31.880
<v Speaker 1>This woman liked Anastasia's whips onto a sense of humor.</v>

289
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Another tutor pr guerrilla agreed.</v>

290
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:35.870
<v Speaker 1>They found the tree princess first.</v>

291
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.471
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

292
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:38.240
<v Speaker 1>once he spent more time around this woman,</v>

293
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:40.340
<v Speaker 1>he agreed that they were not the same person.</v>

294
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.830
<v Speaker 1>She was soft spoken and ladylike,</v>

295
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but relatives who only saw her when she was on her best behavior.</v>

296
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.430
<v Speaker 1>It was easy to imagine that she could be Anastasia,</v>

297
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but for people who knew what she was really like,</v>

298
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 1>this was an entirely different passenger.</v>

299
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 1>The surviving members of the royal family mess up to discuss whether or not this</v>

300
00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 1>woman deserve to receive the inheritance of the seminal family.</v>

301
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.851
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

302
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:04.370
<v Speaker 1>they came to a vote and decided that there was not enough evidence to prove that</v>

303
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>she was the real.</v>

304
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia has.</v>

305
00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Supporters were shocked because they really felt that she was the true princess.</v>

306
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Grendel,</v>

307
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Xenia,</v>

308
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Alexandra [inaudible] sister of saw Nicholas the second and Anastasia zones,</v>

309
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.331
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

310
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 1>That she was outraged by this decision and that the remaining family was simply</v>

311
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>just greedy for the friends and family who believed to.</v>

312
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>They felt very sorry for this disowned princess and wanted to do whatever they</v>

313
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:27.634
<v Speaker 1>could to help out.</v>

314
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>She lives a life of luxury and she was given anything.</v>

315
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>She could have a once.</v>

316
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 1>She eventually moved to New York with a woman named Annie,</v>

317
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.260
<v Speaker 1>but Jennings,</v>

318
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 1>where she was able to live in a gorgeous penthouse.</v>

319
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>She changed the names.</v>

320
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 1>You nrn doesn't.</v>

321
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 1>She met a man named Jack Manhattan,</v>

322
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>who was a history teacher in Virginia that have doubt,</v>

323
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>a very happy life together in the United States.</v>

324
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Anderson went to a grave claiming that she was grand,</v>

325
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.050
<v Speaker 1>was on a stage young</v>

326
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 1>after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990.</v>

327
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 1>One historian searched for the bodies of the Romanov family.</v>

328
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>After confirming their identity is through DNA tests with surviving relatives</v>

329
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>that were given a proper burial and the son Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint</v>

330
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg and canonized a saint in 1998.</v>

331
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.691
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

332
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the bodies of Alexi and under you,</v>

333
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>we're missing this was enough to further fuel the debate.</v>

334
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So now we have the question.</v>

335
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>That of course is in your mind,</v>

336
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's whether Anna Anderson was actually Anastasia off to rule.</v>

337
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.550
<v Speaker 1>This inspired several movies and plays including the 1997 animated movie</v>

338
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia and 2007.</v>

339
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 1>The bones of two human bodies were found buried in the middle of the woods</v>

340
00:13:35.771 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>inside area one,</v>

341
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>it was a male and the female,</v>

342
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 1>the bones showed signs of being doused with acid and burned by fire as well.</v>

343
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 1>It was finally confirmed through DNA testing that these were the missing bodies</v>

344
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>of anesthesia and Alexi.</v>

345
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 1>According to records and forensic evidence,</v>

346
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 1>scientists and historians now believe that the men who killed the Romanovs</v>

347
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 1>attempted to burn the bodies,</v>

348
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 1>but started off with the two smallest Alexi under anesthesia.</v>

349
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 1>They covered the bones in sulfuric acid and then set them on fire.</v>

350
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 1>When they discovered that this did not completely destroy the evidence,</v>

351
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 1>they decided to move along and it's buried the rest of the body's elsewhere.</v>

352
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.730
<v Speaker 1>This is why the two children had been separated from the rest of their family.</v>

353
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.863
<v Speaker 1>As for Anna Anderson,</v>

354
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.810
<v Speaker 1>she was dead years before the truth of her identity was revealed.</v>

355
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It sounds out that she was a Polish factory worker.</v>

356
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.500
<v Speaker 1>She was married and work together with her husband.</v>

357
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>One day a grenade was tossed into the factory and exploded.</v>

358
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 1>She had to witness the love of her life and several coworkers dying around her</v>

359
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>before receiving a severe head injury I bought.</v>

360
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>He was scarred from the shrapnel of the explosion.</v>

361
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.770
<v Speaker 1>After recovering from her wounds,</v>

362
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>she had no family,</v>

363
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 1>no friends to help at home.</v>

364
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 1>She somehow managed to make it to Germany,</v>

365
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 1>which is where the police found her,</v>

366
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.813
<v Speaker 1>and as they say,</v>

367
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the rest is history.</v>

368
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>After revealing the truth of our identity,</v>

369
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.790
<v Speaker 1>many people began to call and around us and a fraud and Delilah.</v>

370
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>She was able to live a life of total luxury and many considered to simply be a</v>

371
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 1>very skilled con women.</v>

372
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

373
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible that in a mental state she may have actually believed that</v>

374
00:14:58.041 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 1>she was the real Anastasia.</v>

375
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Before she was discovered in the mental hospital.</v>

376
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.070
<v Speaker 1>She was a young woman who had nothing left to live for.</v>

377
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.170
<v Speaker 1>She was ready to take her own life,</v>

378
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but becoming.</v>

379
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Anastasia gave her an identity,</v>

380
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.943
<v Speaker 1>a purpose,</v>

381
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>and a family who loved her,</v>

382
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 1>for the people who desperately needed to regain that faith in humanity.</v>

383
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.890
<v Speaker 1>They needed to believe the innocent children had survived the slaughter in our</v>

384
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:23.600
<v Speaker 1>own way and around us and gave them a reason to believe in miracles from what we</v>

385
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 1>know about the real Anastasia.</v>

386
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 1>She lived to make people smile if she knew that her memory and even the mere</v>

387
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 1>possibility of being alive brought so much hope and joy to so many people,</v>

388
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.140
<v Speaker 1>she would surely have been proud.</v>
