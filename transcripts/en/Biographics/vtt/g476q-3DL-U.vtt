1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.810
Yogi zuccaro was born into extreme poverty,

2
00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:07.811
but ended up as the commanding general in charge of the entire Red Army during

3
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.260
World War Two today,

4
00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:13.280
he is still considered by many in Russia to be the greatest military minds in

5
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:14.810
their entire history.

6
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.990
Yogi Zika was born in 1896 to an incredibly poor peasant family in the Kalunga

7
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:34.880
province,
roughly 80 miles from Moscow.

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.510
It's family had a house in the relatively poor town of Australia cove cow,

9
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.110
which is Yaakov was once quoted as saying,
look to the West in his village.

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800
The family was rather tough when it came to discipline and it's floggings with a

11
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:50.000
bells by his father constant and were quite common in order to with his boy into

12
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.380
the shape that he wants it.

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.550
How are the young Zuckoff was not one to complain about things if there's a hard

14
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:59.330
life at a young age was one of the best teachers possible and to hard life.

15
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.500
It was something he certainly had the,
has one older sister named Maria,

16
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.710
but almost grew up with the younger brother as well.
Unfortunately,

17
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.300
his brother Alexi did not live past a year and his mother or Stingier was

18
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.930
absolutely heartbroken.
Then at the tender age of nine,

19
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:19.040
his life changed drastically in order to provide for his future and it's

20
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.110
probably also to have one less mouth to feed.

21
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.250
His family sent him off to work for his uncle Mikhail and Moscow is an

22
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.330
apprentice furrier.

23
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.090
While there was still a pretty harsh life and beatings were common,

24
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.010
if he didn't do what he was supposed to do,

25
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:35.390
he was still in a much better position relatively than he had been before.

26
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.620
He wasn't quite as poor.

27
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.940
He was exposed to Moscow society and he had a lot more education Vinnie would've

28
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.803
had otherwise.

29
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.530
In the year 1920 [inaudible] had his first marriage to a woman named Alexandra

30
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.363
Devenir,
Zuku Hoover,

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.770
who he would eventually have two daughters with named era and Ella.
However,

32
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.610
Zuckoff was not entirely faithful to his wife during his first marriage.

33
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:56.390
In the early years.

34
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.040
He has an affair with a young woman named Maria Volkova who had Matt while laid

35
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.130
up in the hospital while in the army during World War One.

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.010
They add an illegitimate child together named Margaret Rita,

37
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:11.270
but this didn't seem to have any real effect on zoo reputation at the time or

38
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.420
any point in his career.
In fact,
indeed later on in life,

39
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.700
he got divorced and remarried a woman who was called Galena Alexandra overnight

40
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.380
Samuel Nova,
and they had a daughter together called Maria,

41
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.660
which was his fourth and his lost child.

42
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.500
Zuckoff was actually doing quite well as a young man recently into adult who had

43
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.560
working as a furrier with a few young men under him.

44
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.290
But when world war one broke out,
since Russia needed able bodied mends,

45
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.810
it comes to the defense of their country.

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.190
Zuckoff was conscripted into the army or they've no account says that he had any

47
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.030
complaints about being drafted and he quickly found himself in an advanced

48
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.810
training program,
likely because it was a little bit more educated than most.

49
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
He got to start out training as cavalry and quickly rose up the ranks to

50
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:52.970
corporal.
During World War II,

51
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.530
he even managed to earn the cross of St George twice a Russian military honor

52
00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:00.850
awarded for bravery from lower ranking or noncommissioned officers.

53
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.090
One award was for his caption of a German soldier runs.

54
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.870
Another was for taking a grenade explosion that left him in the hospital for

55
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.460
most of the rest of the war because he was in fact taken out of the war so early

56
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.294
due to injury.

57
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.710
He never really felt that his part in it was a tool significance Zuko of having

58
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.840
gone through so much poverty in his early life.

59
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:23.320
It never really been a fan of the SARS or the old political systems.

60
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.750
So when things started shaking up in Russia,

61
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.440
he founds himself fighting the old system.
When the,
sorry Nicholas,

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.280
the second abdicated things were in chaos and the provisional government took

63
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:37.810
over Yogi and the soldiers working with him decided to refuse to obey this new

64
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.420
government.
Since we're seeing branded as dessert is,

65
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.460
and they ended up on the run.
However,

66
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.960
once the Bolsheviks seized power as Uconn was once again able to leave the

67
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:48.910
shadows and join up with them as a soldier.

68
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.900
After several years of participating in mopping up actions against various rebel

69
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:57.010
factions,
he decided to join the Communist Party in order to further his career.

70
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.730
His steady hand as a commander as well as his background of poverty made him a

71
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:05.731
great asset for the new regime and its star continued to rise as he rose up the

72
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.150
ranks in the military.
He became more well known but is most decisive.

73
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.500
Early action was a situation most people aren't aware of in world war one in

74
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.130
which two years before the Germans actually declared war on the Soviet Union,

75
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.130
the Russians already have their hands full with the Japanese.

76
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.030
The Japanese had been adventuring into Russian territory for some decades in the

77
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.640
Russians had been struggling to push them back out.

78
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.020
The Japanese even reached so close that they could almost disrupt the crucial

79
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.760
Trans Siberian railway.
Japanese wanted more land and more island at the time.

80
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:41.080
They saw expansion into Russia as the best option to achieve their goals.

81
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.920
The Japanese had been having border clashes,
a rationale laid territory,

82
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.940
basically trying to sneak through their weakest points for almost a year when

83
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.380
Zuckoff who had been given command of the Soviet forces finally readied for his

84
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:58.381
first offensive where the Japanese had a mast or to the Galvin goal river,

85
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.760
he amassed over 200 artillery pieces,

86
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.390
over 500 planes and almost 500 tanks.

87
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.100
He had the greatest Ahmed offensive in known human history and in one big push

88
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.940
started barraging the Japanese position with bombers.
Following this,

89
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:16.990
there was an artillery barrage and then tanks finally in circling the enemy to

90
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:21.160
the point that almost no one escapes this security officer reputation as a great

91
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:21.581
leader,

92
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.540
able to move incredible amounts of new armored units effectively and earns him

93
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.120
special attention from Soviet high command.

94
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.830
There are some people who argue the zoo called exaggerated his role in the

95
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:41.970
battle of calc and Goldman's other battles as well in water to aggrandized

96
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.230
himself and that he got away with it because the Soviet Union wanted a standard

97
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:49.230
bearer and man's because he managed to get along well with Stalin.

98
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.020
One researcher named [inaudible],

99
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.240
who has written critically of Zuckoff claims that the real credit for the

100
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:58.120
strategy at the battle of Calkin goal should have gone to chief of staff as a

101
00:05:58.121 --> 00:06:00.800
brigade commander named an a Bogdanov,

102
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.850
who was often considered to be the greatest leader that the Soviet Union had at

103
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.600
the time.

104
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.320
He also laments that most of the first officers or of our lesser leaders

105
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.460
involved seemed to still be classified as if the Soviet Union wanted all the

106
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.440
credit to go to Zuckoff.
However,

107
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.460
apart from the fact that Maa Bogdanov was a great leader at the time,

108
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.870
there is no reason to believe Zuckoff didn't plan or make his own decisions in

109
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:25.940
the battle.
He was the acting commander.

110
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.570
After all the slide criticisms and claims of proper credit,

111
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.290
he became stolons favorite general and despite occasional disagreements,

112
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:37.670
he quickly became Stalin's quasi official second in commands for the rest of the

113
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.750
war.
Now,
of course,

114
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:41.930
there were some major faults that Zuckoff had as a military leader.

115
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.920
Mainly he could often be seen getting very angry using a lot of foul language

116
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:47.990
and being abusive with people.
However,

117
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.680
this was not entirely uncommon for a lot of military leaders of the day,

118
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.550
and there is reason to believe that his men respected him because he actually

119
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.170
valued their lives.

120
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.470
One thing many people like to talk about about the Soviet Union is the casual

121
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.920
disregard that they had for the lives of their soldiers.
For example,

122
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.700
they'd just throw masses of infantry at fort to find positions with no proper

123
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:11.120
strategy and zoom call.
I've got a lot of the blame for this as the commander.

124
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.631
However,

125
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:15.950
he criticized these tactics and indeed said that it was criminal to throw lives

126
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:17.000
away in such a way.

127
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.690
And in another bit of writing he was a little bit less critical sounding,

128
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:23.390
but pointed out that skill and tactics would win,

129
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:26.780
was not throwing the people meet at the enemy.

130
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.540
General Zuckoff became very close to style in over the course of world war two,

131
00:07:30.541 --> 00:07:34.280
but at least as close as you can get to a brutal dictator and gained a certain

132
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.143
respect for him,

133
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.810
whilst the Gulf may have been more critical of Stalin's influence and style of

134
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.480
leadership in his later life and memoirs at the time,

135
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.360
he has nothing but good things to say and seems to at least be mostly Anamund by

136
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.810
Stalin's growing cultive personality over the course of roughly 120 in person

137
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:53.960
meetings.
He got to know the man and felt that he had a good measure of him.

138
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.890
Some people fought that stolen,
could be too angry or too moody,

139
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:02.370
but Zuckoff seemed to prefer this.
He felt that Stalin's show of anger,

140
00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:04.490
of frustration than other emotions were.

141
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.510
Just an example of him being exactly the sort of straight shooter [inaudible]

142
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.780
wanted to work with.
And he also felt that when Stalin was not moody,

143
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:15.740
he was very analytical and was always willing to listen to all viewpoints or

144
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.310
hear an arguments against his own ideas in order to better understand the

145
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.660
situation.
In fact,

146
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.920
Zuckoff newt stolen so well that he was said to be able to gauge his moods and

147
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.060
thus how to react by how stolen handled his smoking pipe.

148
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.620
If Stalin was smoking slowly taking long luxurious drags from his pipe,

149
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.070
it usually meant he was in a particularly good mood.
However,

150
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:40.580
if he didn't refill his pipe and it's it going again quickly when he was out,

151
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.590
it's Manti.
It was about to get very,

152
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.270
very angry zuckoff use these signs to help them know how to talk to start and

153
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:51.020
even when he was in a very bad mood at the battle for Berlin,

154
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.560
General Zuniga was in charge of the first velour Russian front and urged his men

155
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.470
to exact a terrible vengeance on the journalists.

156
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.160
They were entirely successful and finally defeating the Germans,

157
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.770
but also in terms of their vengeance.

158
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.290
As the Russian front moved into Germany from the east,

159
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.940
they brought terror upon civilians wherever they went with looting and rapes.

160
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:15.930
Being especially common off of the battle of Berlin generals who golf was given

161
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.550
the honor of presiding over the Soviet victory parade in Moscow in 1945 which he

162
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.690
happily took part in before being sent back to preside as the commander in

163
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:26.940
charge of the Soviet occupied Germany.

164
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.170
Zuckoff was quickly using his post as military governance have become good

165
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.970
friends with other world leaders like Eisenhower and increases influence abroad

166
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.820
by doing a really good job of taking care of civilians in the aftermath of world

167
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:39.750
war two in Germany,

168
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.860
stalling quickly became paranoid that zuckoff would become a political or a

169
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:46.760
military threat to him and removes him from this post,

170
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.970
bringing him back home to face challenges of disloyalty.
Stalin was himself.

171
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:54.960
A military commands it,
but from a day when there was no mechanized warfare,

172
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.130
even though Zuckoff was no real threat as he never had the political chops of

173
00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.670
Stalin,

174
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.670
he was seen as a threat because he has an understanding of this sort of warfare

175
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.380
and a certain popularity within the military.

176
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.980
This was something that stolen would always be shadow self

177
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.190
when style and started a fair general Zuke off at the end of the war.

178
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:23.940
He decided to make an example out of him but not too big of one.

179
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.630
Considering his popularity,
Stalin did not think it wise to kill,

180
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.550
arrest or punish him too harshly,

181
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.140
but he wanted to put him firmly in his place.
Upon his return to Moscow,

182
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:38.850
he was raked over the coals and privately accused of disloyalty to the party in

183
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.240
order to take away his ability to potentially take over the government.

184
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.180
His position as commander in chief of the military forces.

185
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.860
It was taken away and he was sent off to a secondary position in Adesa or a much

186
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:54.240
smaller commands far from Moscow where he suffered his first heart attack not

187
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.700
long after he found himself back in Moscow for a time,

188
00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:58.280
but the very barrier stylings,

189
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.550
radically loyal security chief was trying to find a way to destroy him.

190
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.750
Variant never trusted a man with so much military power and believed he could be

191
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:10.080
a dangerous threats to the cult of stolen barrier.
Finally,

192
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:14.550
it searched as it causes apartments in 1948 and found a huge true of treasures

193
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.630
that Zuckoff had taken back from Soviet occupied Germany without telling anyone,

194
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.040
despite its popularity,

195
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.820
it was a big hit to his reputation and Zuckoff was forced to publicly apologize

196
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:27.300
before finding himself being sent to an even more insulting,

197
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:30.930
and it's pathetic position in the Urals district policy of curves in life may

198
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:34.560
have taken quite a bad turn after the war.
It's could have been worse.

199
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.680
Barrier likely would have had him arrested or executed if he could,

200
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:41.010
but Stalin was not really interested in going that far.
Again,

201
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:44.910
it's Zuckoff whether for personal or politically pragmatic reasons.

202
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.000
The venturing barrier was one of Stalin's most radical followers,

203
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:52.410
so when Stalin died in 1953 many of the top leaders of the Soviet Union were

204
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:56.950
struggling to who would be the one in power and a group of smaller conspirators

205
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.040
works together to overthrow the last of Stalin's main influence in order to

206
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.550
destroy your barrier and Mallon Golf.

207
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.780
Molly Tov and Khrushchev match with Zuckoff and hatched a plan to arrest him.

208
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.070
That would be a major party meeting with many high profile members and at the

209
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:12.671
right moment,

210
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.720
zuckoff would come in with a few military officers and arrest barrier,

211
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.290
the arrest it went off without any hitch at all into barrier was taken away to

212
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:25.090
be accused formally of terrorism and counter revolutionary activities judged

213
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.460
officially and then shot for his crimes.

214
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.750
Zuko of likely placed a large portion if not all of the blame for the horrible

215
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.291
positions.

216
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:35.890
He had been increasingly relegated to you after Stalin's death as well as the

217
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.440
horrific embarrassment of the trophy affair on the shoulders of barrier was he

218
00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:41.980
called,
didn't like to think he was guessing,

219
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:46.981
reads of the influence of the cult of Stalin's likely told himself that was part

220
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.280
of his justification.

221
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.870
He must have certainly got a lot of personal satisfaction out of the man's

222
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:55.490
destruction.
He even once said that arresting barrier,

223
00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:58.900
it was the greatest thing he had ever done in his life.

224
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.680
While all is leading from the trophy of Fau wasn't exactly a great thing to do.

225
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.360
It is understandable for him to harbor resentment at having as lutes taken away

226
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:09.190
and is being forced to apologize for it.

227
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.210
As that kind of looting was quite common among the Soviet leadership after World

228
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:17.020
War Two after the death of Stalin and the arrest of barrier beating to the end

229
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:18.610
of Stalin's cult of personality,

230
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.710
Zuko soon found himself appointed as minister of defense.

231
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.340
Sunday Nick Align Bogan in.
During these years,

232
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:28.210
he'd tried to foster peace between the United States,
the Soviet Union,

233
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:31.660
and the rest of the wells being reluctant to take military action unless

234
00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:33.010
absolutely necessary.

235
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.940
There's partly stems from long conversations that he had with Dwight d

236
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.510
Eisenhower with whom he had struck up a friendship years previously at the end

237
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:44.550
of World War Two Zuko took Eisenhower on a tour of the Soviet Union and an

238
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.810
Eisenhower even invited Zuckoff to America,

239
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.150
although he was not allowed to go on such a tall.

240
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.500
The two of them talked a lot and even corresponded through letters for years

241
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:57.130
after after meeting with Zuke,
often getting to know him so well.

242
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:00.790
Eisenhower actually believed that true and lasting peace with the Soviet Union

243
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:04.890
was entirely possible and he hoped that his relationship with Zuke often zuckoff

244
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.200
influence influencing governments and with the Russian people would help to make

245
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:09.670
that happen.
Unfortunately,

246
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.960
Zuckoff was such a reformist and continued to take power to himself in such a

247
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:16.660
way that those in charge became increasingly worried about him.

248
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.530
When Zuckoff wrote extremely critically of the cult of style in denouncing the

249
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:23.020
way the government used to be run under the old dictator.

250
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.120
Wily old Khrushchev used Zuckoff statements and popularity to institute real

251
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:30.580
reforms with himself as the head,

252
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.190
but at the same time he was worried about to cough.

253
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.240
The former general is now minister of defense was asking soldiers to go to him

254
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:39.670
first before any of the politicians,
and it's crucial.

255
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:43.780
Jeff had him removed as minister of defense in 1958 for fear of him becoming a

256
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:44.070
burner.

257
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.430
Potus after how badly Napoleon had thrashed and relatively recently and their

258
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:48.851
history,

259
00:14:48.851 --> 00:14:53.570
the Russians fair to leader who would take from within using the military and

260
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:57.040
then run the country by military hates politicians like crease.

261
00:14:57.041 --> 00:15:01.940
Jeff believes the zoom call was loyal and they loved to use the popularity that

262
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:02.930
he has with the people,

263
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:07.220
but they found these same traits dangerous to the continued political rule of

264
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:08.054
their country.

265
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.790
Unfortunately,

266
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.200
Zuckoff had today history of being used by politicians do achieve their own ends

267
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:20.910
and then being thrown aside later.

268
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.660
It's hard to say if this kept happening simply because the Zuckoff was hoping to

269
00:15:24.661 --> 00:15:25.800
gain more political power,

270
00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:29.730
but simply did not have the political skills or whether he knew he was unlikely

271
00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:30.960
to gain any real power,

272
00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:35.340
but simply did what he thought was best for the country at the time.
Regardless,

273
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.090
it would likely be quite a different world if zuckoff had had the political

274
00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:43.020
skills to truly advance in the power structure that emerged in the Soviet Union

275
00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:45.660
after World War Two if he weren't who have taken control,

276
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.620
his relationship with Eisenhower might've helps bridge the divide between the

277
00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:54.480
two countries.
History might have turned out very,
very differently.
However,

278
00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:57.720
things we're not all bad with Khrushchev and control until the end of his

279
00:15:57.721 --> 00:16:02.721
premiership in 1964 Khrushchev was a tireless reformer who got ribs of a lot of

280
00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:07.470
the repressive stolen as policies and try to bring more art and creativity back

281
00:16:07.471 --> 00:16:08.340
to the country again.

282
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.520
When Brezhnev came to power in 1964 he also saw Zuckoff as so many had before

283
00:16:13.591 --> 00:16:17.880
him.
Has someone he could use whilst you've off had been largely ignored under

284
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:20.460
Khrushchev.
There was under the premiership of bread and half of this.

285
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.300
He was allowed to publish his memoirs after properly groveling to you,

286
00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:26.310
the latest leader of the country.
Of course,

287
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.640
he also had his public image greatly rehabilitated by Brezhnev and order to

288
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.930
shore up his own popularity while brash and have used Zuckoff for his
popularity.

289
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.370
He did not trust him in politics after all of the accusations of burner partism

290
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.070
over the years and depart from writing his memoirs.

291
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.900
Zuckoff would remain retired for the rest of his remaining years.
Wednesday,

292
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.660
golf for retired.

293
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.350
His thoughts went to writing his memoirs and he started working on reminisces

294
00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:52.410
and reflections.
He also spends a lot of time just relaxing,

295
00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:56.070
hunting and socializing with people are used to know as he wrote his memoirs.

296
00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.020
However,
his health continued to steadily decline,
is balanced with heart disease.

297
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.500
Earlier in life were a sign of things to come and in 1967 Zuckoff has another

298
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.300
heart attack that hit him so hard.

299
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.140
It took away the use of the left side of his body for his remaining years.

300
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.950
During his struggle with heart disease.

Unfortunately,

306

314
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.280
