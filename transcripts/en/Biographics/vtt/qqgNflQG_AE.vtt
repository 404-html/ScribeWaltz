00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.440
Imagine traveling in a foreign country when you learn the news,

2
00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:04.880
if your father's death.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.890
Now imagine that that death means you are now at the helm of the British empire.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.440
This is our Queen Elizabeth.

5
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:14.480
The second discovered that she would no longer be a princess,

6
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.040
but instead would be the queen of the most powerful empire in history.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.390
She was only 25 years old and would soon become the head of one of the world's

8
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:28.340
most powerful monarchies,
a post she would hold for much of the 20th century.

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.390
Elizabeth wasn't even supposed to be Queen Barnes as the old saying goes,

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.820
humans plan.
God laughs.

11
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.380
Elizabeth was born on April the 21st 1926 do the Duke and Duchess of York or

12
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:50.690
father,
Prince Albert,

13
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.400
who was at that time the second in line to the monarchy following the current

14
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:59.040
King George the fifth and his older brother Edward Prince of Wales and sure to

15
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.360
her parents or Prince Albert have had a son,

16
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.620
the male as would jump ahead of Elizabeth in the line of succession.

17
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.470
It wants to Elizabeth Sungold Edwards,
the Prince of Wales,

18
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:12.040
whose behavior alter to this line of succession in love with an American

19
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:14.080
divorcee Edward abdicated the throne.

20
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:18.010
In 1936 I made a public uproar about his love life.

21
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.300
Elizabeth's father became King George the sixth and Elizabeth became the next in

22
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:26.520
line to the throne at the age of just 10 reportedly,
Elizabeth,

23
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.320
his younger sister,
Margaret,
told her,

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.650
pour you upon learning the news of the new line of succession now before the

25
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:34.870
family was thrust into the role of monarchs,

26
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.860
Elizabeth Margaret's and their parents lived a relatively quiet life split

27
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:41.290
between homes in London and the countryside.

28
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.260
Elizabeth was educated at home by a governess.

29
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.980
She wasn't around children her own age,
with the exception of her sister,

30
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.940
which was a somewhat lonely experience that she tried to avoid for her own

31
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:53.620
children during these lessons,

32
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:57.580
and Elizabeth enjoyed learning about history and also showed herself to be a

33
00:01:57.581 --> 00:01:59.750
responsible and organized childs.

34
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.300
She even insisted on properly setting up a toy,
horses before bed each night,

35
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.270
making sure that each was unsettled and fat

36
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.090
as intelligence and responsible as she showed herself to me and Elizabeth still

37
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:21.860
showed herself to be like many of the children in one regard and that was that

38
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:25.610
she had trouble pronouncing or name instead of Elizabeth.

39
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.200
She said Lily Beth as a results of the nickname stuck and it was water close.

40
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:34.250
Family would come to know her as as Elizabeth grew older and became next in line

41
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.510
to the throne,
more emphasis was placed on formal education.
As a 12 year old,

42
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:43.511
she was taught constitutional history from a member of Eatons faculty and as the

43
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.160
Archbishop of Canterbury,
also religious instructor.

44
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.790
It wasn't exactly what you'd call a typical education,

45
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.450
but there wasn't all dry scholastics studies being the daughter of the king says

46
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.820
and Lee did have its perks.
Do you help Elizabeth Social reach and outdoors.

47
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.210
A Buckingham Palace chapter of the girl guides was started each Wednesday

48
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.560
afternoon.
20 fortunate girls.
Well,

49
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:09.570
welcome to the panelists to take part in outdoors orientated activities and it's

50
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:12.310
be part of the future.
Queens social circle,

51
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.390
but alas,
the comfortable innocent childhood of Elizabeth.

52
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.920
It was not the lost coming of age in the 1930s how life would be affected by

53
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.921
World War II before she turns 15 by 1939 England's was worn and do pressure

54
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:39.070
mountain to send Elizabeth and Margaret to Canada.

55
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.230
Their mother would hear of no such thing.
Instead,

56
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.200
they were sent to live in Windsor Castle in 1940 this mid served two purposes

57
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.950
keeping Elizabeth and Margaret Safer than they might otherwise be in London,

58
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.730
but also helping to show the strength of the country in Italian old,

59
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.260
terrible upheaval and fear.
If England was safe enough for the princesses,

60
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.430
then it was safe enough for the rest of the country too and it's Brits should be

61
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:07.990
proud and patriotic to do their duty for the war just like the young princesses

62
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:11.470
were doing.
Now,
while the all sisters were staying in a colossal vans,

63
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.710
were closely watched deva,

64
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.650
that does not mean the princesses were completely exempt from all the fears and

65
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:21.130
uncertainty that comes with walk.
While they were standing at Windsor Castle,

66
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:25.090
hundreds of bombs were dropped in the area and like so many of their country,

67
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:29.260
and then Elizabeth and Margaret who are roused from bed in the middle of the

68
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.320
night,

69
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.340
rush to the bomb shelters and kept on constant alert for the air raid siren.

70
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.140
In October of 1940 at the age of 14 Elizabeth gave a radio address that was

71
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.450
heard throughout England and in North America.

72
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.720
She discussed the situation that she ends.
Margaret,

73
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:48.310
we're in talking about how they understood what they were evacuated peers were

74
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:48.760
feeling.

75
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.360
They talked about being separated from their loved ones and living in a world's

76
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.880
turned upside down by violence.
But Elizabeth,

77
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.570
she wanted to do more for her country than just speak on the radio.

78
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.470
She was not yet 18 though and it wasn't until near the end of the walk that she

79
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:06.190
was given the opportunity to serve as a trainee ambulance driver.

80
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.660
She learns about car repair and it's photos of her working became iconic images

81
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.270
of the British war efforts.
On ve day.

82
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.380
She wore her uniform and stood on the balcony with prime minister Churchill and

83
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:21.610
to our parents,
and these are the,
she was not yet queen verse even as a teenager,

84
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.070
she had shown herself to be quite the leader

85
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.530
ended in 1945 but its aftermath remains even for royalty.

86
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.080
When Elizabeth married two years after the end of the war,

87
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.130
she purchased the fabric for her wedding gown using ration coupons,

88
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.620
but that didn't mean a dress was a dreary affair.

89
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.740
It was made of silk and decorated with over 10,000 pals or Green Weld.

90
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:54.670
That was Prince Philip of grease,

91
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.460
a man who'd been in and out of Elizabeth's life since she was 13 years old.

92
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.720
As second cousins,

93
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.510
they saw each other at family functions throughout their lives.

94
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.500
Teenage Elizabeth,

95
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.980
she'd been intrigued by Phillips since meeting him in her early teens,

96
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.630
but it was when Elizabeth was 17 and he was 22 that the prince began to consider

97
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:15.110
marrying her.
Now,
as we did mention,
they were second cousins,

98
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:19.070
but such a marriage between cousins is hardly unusual for royalty.

99
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.820
Philip was born in Greece and was a member of the line of succession to the

100
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.080
Greek throne.
However,

101
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:27.500
he gave up his position in the line of succession to become a naturalized a

102
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.750
British citizen.
The night before their wedding,

103
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.900
he was made the Duke of Edinburgh voting.

104
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.560
They announced their engagement in July of 1947 celebrating the happy occasion

105
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:39.170
with a garden party in photos from the party.

106
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.200
Elizabeth is unabashedly excited while Prince Philip gazes down at her adoringly

107
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.830
only at four months later in November of 1947 the two were married in a ceremony

108
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.700
at Westminster Abbey,
the Archbishop of Canterbury and York performance,

109
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:55.370
the right with Roti or realms.
The world in attendance.

110
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.050
200 million common is we're able to listen in via BBC radio broadcast.

111
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.063
After the ceremony,

112
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.340
Elizabeth and Philip with Elizabeth still wearing her wedding gown,

113
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.510
waved to cheering crowds from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

114
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.510
Shortly after Elizabeth gave birth to their first child,

115
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:16.511
Prince Charles in 1948 our daughter Anne was added to the family in 1950 it

116
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.790
would be over a decade before and it's a bit of gave birth to her youngest sons,

117
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.990
Prince Edwards and Prince Andrew.
As an interesting aside here,

118
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.290
Elizabeth was serving as queen when Prince Edward and Prince Andrew were born,

119
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.550
which makes her the first queen in England's history to give birth while holding

120
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:32.384
the title.

121
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.930
It was her husband,
Phillip.

122
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.560
You had the difficult duty of passing the word to his wife that her father had

123
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:48.980
passed video,
knew he was ill.
In fact,

124
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.930
they were traveling in Kenya because the king was not well enough to travel

125
00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:55.440
internationally,
so his daughter and son indoor took on the duty.

126
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.750
The trip was post doing,
glued to travel to Australia and New Zealand.
Of course,

127
00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:04.020
news of the king's death took priority over all else.

128
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.410
Elizabeth true to the steric stereotype of the British and the discussion.
He,

129
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:11.730
the royals reportedly did not succumb to her emotions upon hearing the news,

130
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.510
but instead began planning the practical steps for what must come next.

131
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.560
She ends Phillip.
Well,

132
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.710
they returned to England and it was on that plane flight home that she finally

133
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:23.280
allowed herself to cry.
Although of course she never did this in public.

134
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.150
Even on that flight,
she hid in the bathroom and emerged with red and I,

135
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.610
his buddy composed face years later.

136
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.450
Elizabeth recalled the implications of taking the throne at such a young age.

137
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.110
In a way.
I didn't have an apprenticeship.
My father died much too young.

138
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.730
It's a question of maturing into something that one's got used to and accepting

139
00:08:41.731 --> 00:08:44.070
the fact that,
hey,
you are and it's your fate,

140
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.630
because I think there's continuity is very important.
It is a job for life.

141
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.890
Preparations for Elizabeth's coronation ceremony took over a year and the father

142
00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:57.720
died in February of 1952 but the coronation didn't decar car in till June of

143
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:00.630
1953 it did rain on the day of our coronation,

144
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:04.320
but this did nothing to temper the excitement of the day for the British people

145
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.270
who had watched this young women grow up.

146
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.430
Elizabeth was correlated in Westminster Abbey,

147
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.150
bringing her into the line of kings and Queens who had been crowns there for

148
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.490
nearly a millennium,
not even 30 years old.

149
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.160
Elizabeth solomnly delivered to the coronation oath,

150
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.380
which was heard by millions around the world.

151
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.070
The ceremony and a sign of the changing times was the first British coronation

152
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:26.360
ceremony to be televised in her coronation speech.
Elizabeth,

153
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.800
it looks to the future saying,
yeah,

154
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.840
<v 3>the following,
I am sure that this,</v>

155
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.900
my coordination is not the symbol of a par and the splendor that I've gone,

156
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.560
but a declaration of our hopes for the future and for the years.

157
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.610
I May,
by God's grace and mercy,

158
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.630
be given to reign and serve you as your queen.

159
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.370
<v 0>Following the actual ceremony,</v>

160
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:57.090
Elizabeth and dozens of other dignitaries rude through the streets of London.

161
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.030
She had by adoring crowds,
still more reporting.
Brits stood and cheered hands.

162
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.940
She waved to them from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.
Later in the evening,

163
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.910
Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace after the coronation,

164
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.640
but they did not spend much time there initially.
Instead,

165
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:16.200
they took off on a weld tour for months of 1953 in 1954 the tall was the

166
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.020
brainchild of a prime minister Winston Churchill.

167
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.790
He recognized the appeal of Queen Elizabeth TV,
the masses and the possibilities.

168
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.570
Sanjay fevered queen presented for building a positive image of England abroad.

169
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.350
They're all a couple.

170
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.850
They went around the wells making Elizabeth fifth first European Monica to so

171
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.350
she was also the first reigning British monarch to visit Australia and New

172
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.220
Zealand and Fiji.

173
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.420
This trip was only the first of many verse Elizabeth would take his queen during

174
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:46.890
her 65 years and counting as queen that she has become the world's most widely

175
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.960
traveled Monique,
and by the way,
as Queen,

176
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:52.110
she does have an easier time than the rest of us because of the way British and

177
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:53.420
international ball works,

178
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.300
which means that she doesn't actually need to have a passport.
If she did,

179
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:59.880
how they passport though there would be plenty full.

180
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.290
She has made nearly 300 foreign trips.
Do you?
120 countries including,
yeah,

181
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.500
Canada and the United States,
New Zealand,
Australia,
India,
the Muda,

182
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.590
Iran and Saudi Arabia,
Qatar,
Thailand,
Brazil and Russia.

183
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.140
These are but a few of the countries she's visited some of the most notable

184
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.900
trips she's taken into the opening of Canada's parliament.

185
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:20.410
She's been the honoree at a ticker tape parade in New York City and she's

186
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:24.850
awarded the Mother Teresa Order of Merit in India and she's also spoken at the

187
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:29.410
United Nations traveling.
It's been a large part of Queen Elizabeth's reign,

188
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.690
but representing a nation abroad.
Well,

189
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.470
that's not our only duty as a monarch in a constitutional monarchy.

190
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.230
She is tasked with many domestic duties.

191
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.750
Though she doesn't all get involved in politics,

192
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.530
she must stay well informed of what is going on within our country.

193
00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:49.300
Bands around the world each day she receives piles of reading material in case

194
00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:50.950
in red metal boxes.

195
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.940
I think tradition of these red boxes dates in nearly two centuries and until

196
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:58.180
recently members of parliament also received the parliament's is actually

197
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.820
recently opted to get digital versions of these documents,

198
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:05.230
but the queen remains tied to paper delivery so those red boxes continue to

199
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:06.730
arrive daily at our door.

200
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.280
The material contains within encompasses everything from foreign intelligence to

201
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.310
economic updates to the most mundane matters of state reading and digesting.

202
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.670
The information can take several hours a day,

203
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.670
but it is a crucial part of our role as leader.

204
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.260
Even today at the age of 90 she receives her redbox each day and takes the time

205
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:29.710
to go through the crucial information contained within.
As Queen Elizabeth.

206
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:33.100
Small public duties include presenting metals,
issuing knighted,

207
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.120
Czanne's presiding over many ceremonies that take place in a society that still

208
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:39.160
has a queen as she has aged.

209
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:42.640
Some of Elizabeth's duties have been passed down to our children and to our

210
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.200
grandchildren.
Particularly.

211
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.290
Sarah really is where the nobility received their titles

212
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:57.671
over the years.

213
00:12:57.671 --> 00:13:01.840
Elizabeth's family grew to include the grandchildren and great grandchildren or

214
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:05.620
family and despite their royal bloods is has not been immune from the ups and

215
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.630
downs of life and love.

216
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.710
Three of her four children that have been through divorces with the world.

217
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:16.711
Watching the death of Princess Diana shook the entire family as well as the rest

218
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:17.620
of the world,

219
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.970
but it was in 1992 when much of the royal family seem to crumble with the

220
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:26.620
marriages of princess and Prince Charles and Prince Andrew all coming due.

221
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.480
Their ends is in one way or another.

222
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.890
It was also that year that Windsor Castle caught on fire am's.

223
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.830
The public became outraged at the idea that that tax money would be used to

224
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:40.240
rebuild it.
When the Queen was one of the richest women in the world.
That year,

225
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:40.421
though,

226
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.810
the queen demonstrated a political acumen when it was announced that the royal

227
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:48.811
family would pay for the restoration of Windsor Castle Anz and a reversal of a

228
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.570
thousand year old policy.
The family would begin paying their taxes.

229
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.690
Queen Elizabeth,
she has long understood the importance of public opinion.

230
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.140
She's been the power behind him is the British monarchy is increased visibility

231
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:05.950
in the media.

232
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.800
She realized that the public wants it to know more about the family.

233
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.130
They wanted to feel like they knew the royals.
Increased transparency.

234
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:13.270
It was one way to help the role.

235
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:17.470
Family connects with the public and it has long been a hallmark of Elizabeth's

236
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:17.860
reign.

237
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.120
Hers was the first televised coronation and then she was the first to allow

238
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:24.340
television cameras into Buckingham Palace.

239
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.910
Five cameras were allowed into the palace during President Nixon's visits and

240
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:31.450
informal events that included lunch and the swapping of signed photographs

241
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:32.530
between the world leaders.

242
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.190
Elizabeth also welcomed cameras into the families' lives for the production of a

243
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:37.540
documentary on the royals.

244
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.350
They think to show them as simply humans who loved their family members,

245
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.220
but it wasn't until 2007 the Buckingham Palace or really go with the times and

246
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:47.290
launched an official youtube channel.

247
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.890
This was 10 years after perhaps one of the most important displays of

248
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.920
Elizabeth's use of the media to effectively communicate with the public.

249
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.200
Her speech about Princess Diana

250
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.400
when Princess Diana died,

251
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.250
I met the public mourning and the private grief of the family.

252
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.750
Elizabeth broke protocol recognizing that the country and the world needed to

253
00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:18.540
hear from the royal family,
Princess Diana and the Queen.

254
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.740
They were initially close.
In fact,
Diana or even called her Mama.

255
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.980
Let's over time the relationship,
it became the best strange.

256
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.540
Diana regularly broke royal protocol and adds the dirty laundry of her and

257
00:15:30.541 --> 00:15:32.760
Charles is personal lives.
The Queen,

258
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.570
a stoic Monique from the rather different generation did not understand Diane,

259
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.610
his desire to be involved with aids charities or her willingness to talk

260
00:15:41.611 --> 00:15:45.270
publicly about the disintegration off on marriage.
To this day,

261
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.950
the all people like Diana's lover,

262
00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:51.450
dirty fiats father who blamed the queen and the royal family for the car crash

263
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:55.140
that killed Diana and his son when Queen Elizabeth into family did not

264
00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:59.370
immediately express their grief publicly the press and the people of the Worlds,

265
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.810
oh,
they were pretty outraged.

266
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.100
Eventually the Queen Elizabeth did give a naive address it speaking about Diana

267
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.560
and is the tragedy of her death.
The Queen,

268
00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:10.600
she spoke of Diana in the way most of the world view tar.

269
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.950
<v 3>First I wanted to pay tribute to Diana myself.</v>

270
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:20.150
She was an exceptional and gifted human being in good times and bad.

271
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.760
She never lost her capacity to smile and laugh,

272
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.630
nor to inspire others with her warmth and kindness.

273
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:34.130
I admired and respect you to energy and commitment to others and especially for

274
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:37.290
her devotion to her two boys.

275
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.010
<v 0>While public opinion didn't immediately fully rebound in the queen's favor,</v>

276
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.920
the address was helpful and then stemming the tide of criticism.

277
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.390
Unlike her children,
Queen Elizabeth,
she had a long marriage.

278
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.800
She and Phillip have the longest marriage of anyone in the royal family.

279
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.590
2017 actually marks their 70th wedding anniversary.

280
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.060
Then major wedding anniversaries.

281
00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:10.350
They've long been celebrated in England's with that 2050 and marked by a party

282
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.220
that included other couples from around England zoo.

283
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.020
We're all seeing married on November the 20th of 1947 and 2007 the couple

284
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.960
sentimentally returned to that honeymoon site in the Hampshire region of
England.

285
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:26.300
They like any common,
a couple of May to do.
We created their honeymoon photos

286
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.860
at that 50th anniversary Queen Elizabeth in what is regarded as an emotional

287
00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:39.120
expression for a member of the British monarchy sending this with our husbands

288
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:40.110
and our marriage.

289
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.620
<v 3>He is someone who doesn't take easily to complements,</v>

290
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:49.190
but he has quite simply be in my strength and stay all these years and I and his

291
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:55.341
whole family and this and many other countries owe him a debt ratchet greater

292
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.860
than he would ever came.
Well,
we should ever know.

293
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.020
<v 0>Queen Elizabeth is rain now has also been punctuated by your celebrations of</v>

294
00:18:03.021 --> 00:18:07.610
milestones,
not just in her marriage,
but also in the number of reigning years.

295
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.120
The silver jubilee celebrating 25 years of her reign in 1977 what was a

296
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.490
nationwide party marked by sporting events,
carnivals,
concerts,

297
00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:21.410
and general festivities.
25 years later in 2002 golden jubilee.

298
00:18:21.411 --> 00:18:23.390
