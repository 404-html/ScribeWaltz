00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>He's the dentist son who grew up to become the world's youngest billionaire.</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>In the mid two thousands,</v>

3
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>mark Zuckerberg created a website that defines a generational website.</v>

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>You almost certainly use yourself.</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>The bad wolf is facebook today.</v>

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>It dominates the Internet.</v>

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>It has more active users than the populations of China and India combined at the</v>

8
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.024
<v Speaker 1>time of writing.</v>

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>It's worth around half a trillion dollars.</v>

10
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's also at the center of some massive control disease that have dominated the</v>

11
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>headlines.</v>

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

13
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>How much to most of us know about the man behind the business?</v>

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've seen the movie,</v>

15
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>the social network,</v>

16
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>which reimagines Mark Zuckerberg is a kind of Lex luthor of the internet using</v>

17
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>his genius to crush his enemies.</v>

18
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>This elements of truth to that to be sure,</v>

19
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>but the real mark Zuckerberg is far more interesting,</v>

20
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>far more nuanced and far more tragically flawed.</v>

21
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Rich,</v>

22
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.863
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.733
<v Speaker 1>idealistic.</v>

24
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of how one privileged kid from small town,</v>

25
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>New York created a digital empire.</v>

26
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I really need to see all his good intentions collapsed to dust.</v>

27
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>If you were living among the clapboard houses and leafy streets of dobbs ferry,</v>

28
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>New York in the mid nineties,</v>

29
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>they would have been one neighborhood kid who you were sure was going to go far</v>

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>and that would've been mocked soccer bag,</v>

31
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>born in nearby white plains on May the 14th,</v>

32
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>1984 young mark was a veritable prodigy,</v>

33
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>taught Atari basic programming language as a child by age 12.</v>

34
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>He was creating sprawling games from his friends.</v>

35
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Childhood drawings lies mid teens,</v>

36
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Middleton,</v>

37
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>early messaging app called Zach and after this allowed the family to communicate</v>

38
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>with his dad's dentistry business online in real time.</v>

39
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>When mark ended up transferring to these super prestigious Phillips Exeter</v>

40
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Academy for Graduate Computing Course,</v>

41
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>no one was in the least bit surprised this Aka bags had always been a family of</v>

42
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>brain boxes that Edward was a dentist and mum,</v>

43
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Karen was a psychiatrist and the family always encouraged learning in their four</v>

44
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

45
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.143
<v Speaker 1>But mark,</v>

46
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>he was something else,</v>

47
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.071
<v Speaker 1>a polyglot.</v>

48
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It taught himself how to speak French,</v>

49
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew that in an ancient Greek,</v>

50
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>he was captain of the fencing team.</v>

51
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>He devoured classic literature along with the friends,</v>

52
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Adams Angelou.</v>

53
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>It even programmed a media player so advanced that it sparked a bidding war</v>

54
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>between Microsoft and AOL.</v>

55
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

56
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>mark was one of those privileged kids you can tell are destined to forever roll</v>

57
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>doubles sixes in the game of life.</v>

58
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>He had the talent to go far and he had the competitive drive to on a form around</v>

59
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>

60
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He actually listed defeating Nemeses as his hobby.</v>

61
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>So when this woman begins,</v>

62
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>lends into place at Harvard in 2002,</v>

63
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it was just another step on that great long staircase of privilege that led to</v>

64
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>the heaven of a high flying job and day.</v>

65
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the Hamptons only this particular staircase.</v>

66
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It came with a stumbling block.</v>

67
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>This was one that would initially trip 19 year old mark before accidentally</v>

68
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>showing him the how decline far higher than it ever dreams that I'm of that</v>

69
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.444
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>

70
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>that was loneliness.</v>

72
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing about going to Harvard.</v>

73
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>As a small town genius,</v>

74
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>you'll suddenly surrounded by other geniuses for the first time in your life,</v>

75
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and some of these geniuses might be so clever that you start to look a little</v>

76
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>less special and just a bit more ordinary.</v>

77
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>In the 2008 profile rollingstone claims that this was exactly what happens.</v>

78
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg isolated among so many other Harvard brainiacs,</v>

79
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>he retreated into programming and Ben's ending his social life for an online</v>

80
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>world where he could still shine.</v>

81
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>He created a popular site called course match for his fellow students,</v>

82
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>which gave them an insight into what made people tick,</v>

83
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>but course match.</v>

84
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the work of a genius.</v>

85
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>It didn't even make him stand out from the crowd as he so desperately craved.</v>

86
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

87
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>he would have to wait until his sophomore year to do that because that was when</v>

88
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:03.331
<v Speaker 1>he created the little something known as facemash and excluded Harvard society.</v>

89
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.360
<v Speaker 1>In October 2003,</v>

90
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg sat in his dorm room,</v>

91
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.310
<v Speaker 1>drunk and alone and consumer by depression.</v>

92
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It just been jilted by one,</v>

93
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Jessica,</v>

94
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.300
<v Speaker 1>and like every young man,</v>

95
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>unlucky in love,</v>

96
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:26.820
<v Speaker 1>he turned to alcohol to Numb the pain of existence as a morosely blogged about</v>

97
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the bitch who had betrayed him.</v>

98
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen year old Zuckerberg began sneaking through Kirkland dorms,</v>

99
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

100
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.510
<v Speaker 1>That's Harvard Lingo for the online photo directories of students that each dorm</v>

101
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:41.511
<v Speaker 1>keeps his ego winded soccer bag that has negative thoughts flow into his blog.</v>

102
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook picks.</v>

103
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>

104
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and</v>

105
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:49.380
<v Speaker 1>debit people vote on,</v>

106
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 1>which is more attractive.</v>

107
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.890
<v Speaker 1>The more alcoholics,</v>

108
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>acrobatic consumers,</v>

109
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>the more he began to take the idea seriously.</v>

110
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not with a farm animals,</v>

111
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:01.551
<v Speaker 1>but why not put up two pictures of students and have other students vote on who</v>

112
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:02.604
<v Speaker 1>is the hottest.</v>

113
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Before long Zuckerberg was thinking of.</v>

114
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>His idea is more than just a way of lashing out at a world that it wounded him.</v>

115
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It would be an epic prank,</v>

116
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:16.191
<v Speaker 1>one that would no doubt go down in Harvard history by the early morning hit</v>

117
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>successfully hacked all of Harvard's dorm directories,</v>

118
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>scraping away private to use a day runs.</v>

119
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Blogging about is praying every step of the way before the sun rose facemash.</v>

120
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 1>It was live in no time at all.</v>

121
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:32.271
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred and 50 people had viewed the site 22,000 times years later.</v>

122
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.720
<v Speaker 1>The 2010 movie,</v>

123
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 1>the social network would suggest facebook itself grew out of facemash,</v>

124
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>which isn't quite true,</v>

125
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 1>but facemash does remain key to understanding soccer bag,</v>

126
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 1>the scale and speed of the positive response to his prank site.</v>

127
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.720
<v Speaker 1>It opened his eyes as he would later say,</v>

128
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.600
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot more voyeuristic than I would have thought.</v>

129
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a revelation he would assume leverage into huge business success.</v>

130
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

131
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>the one event was guaranteed that cold October night,</v>

132
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>facemash was only live for a few hours before Harvard shut it down and hit</v>

133
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg with the mother of all disciplinary actions.</v>

134
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.290
<v Speaker 1>He could be suspended or expelled,</v>

135
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.630
<v Speaker 1>and then what would his mom and his dad think?</v>

136
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.221
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

137
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.970
<v Speaker 1>For all of the stress that it caused him good,</v>

138
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>that came out of the facemash debacle,</v>

139
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>having gained something invaluable,</v>

140
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>he was special again.</v>

141
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>He was no longer a nobody.</v>

142
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>He was a computer genius and to pranks to hero Zaka bug was even able to</v>

143
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>leverage his new notoriety and to a date with a medical students called</v>

144
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Priscilla Chan and trust me,</v>

145
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>that is a name you are going to be hearing again and again.</v>

146
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>On November the 19th,</v>

147
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>2003 Harvard's disciplinary board.</v>

148
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It's dropped its privacy violation,</v>

149
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.580
<v Speaker 1>charges against Zaka back the prank stuff,</v>

150
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>but water a bottle of champagne and cracked it open with his room is to</v>

151
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>celebrate.</v>

152
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.063
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

153
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you had a place in the world again,</v>

154
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.200
<v Speaker 1>all through 2003.</v>

155
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Harvard had been a campus that was buzzing with ideas.</v>

156
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.970
<v Speaker 1>These were the heady days of web.</v>

157
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Two point zero and social technologies were clearly going to be the next big</v>

158
00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:08.410
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

159
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.840
<v Speaker 1>All they needed was for someone to harness them,</v>

160
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.890
<v Speaker 1>someone with the brains and the talent to pull technology and all human desire</v>

161
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 1>to connect into the first great social website.</v>

162
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone like Divya Narendra and some brilliant New York kid of Indian descent,</v>

163
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Narendra was in his junior year at Harvard when he had a brainwave.</v>

164
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you could take Harvard's many facebooks and combine them all into a</v>

165
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>single site.</v>

166
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It would have a social section,</v>

167
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:34.840
<v Speaker 1>the dating section,</v>

168
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.200
<v Speaker 1>and it would combine all the advantages of real life interaction with the</v>

169
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:39.970
<v Speaker 1>advantages of the facebooks.</v>

170
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 1>The name,</v>

171
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 1>foot Narendra is John's online.</v>

172
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:43.054
<v Speaker 1>Facebook.</v>

173
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>last was Harvard connection.</v>

175
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Bloody Narendra was not an ad mat still.</v>

176
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 1>He managed in April to rope into identical twins,</v>

177
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Tyler and Cameron Winkle Voss.</v>

178
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>They were going to act as his money man,</v>

179
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.220
<v Speaker 1>his team in place and render it now.</v>

180
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Just needed to compute a guy to write the code and pull everything together.</v>

181
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.480
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that the ambitious young entrepreneur about facemash in</v>

182
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>November of 2003 and a render and the winco bosses.</v>

183
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>They contacted the now notorious because look good bags.</v>

184
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.620
<v Speaker 1>You asked if he would help them in that project,</v>

185
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.940
<v Speaker 1>so he jumped at the chance emails from the time that they should release the</v>

186
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:16.870
<v Speaker 1>full of positivity.</v>

187
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.170
<v Speaker 1>He told them it would take 10 hours and that he wouldn't be finished soon.</v>

188
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Narendra and his cohorts,</v>

189
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.500
<v Speaker 1>they rub their hands with glee,</v>

190
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.930
<v Speaker 1>would only be a matter of time before they will all filthy rich as November</v>

191
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.230
<v Speaker 1>ticked over into December.</v>

192
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg abandoned his work on Harvard connection.</v>

193
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It's still though.</v>

194
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 1>He promised new renderer that it would be finished soon,</v>

195
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but he began to start work and his own project.</v>

196
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.970
<v Speaker 1>This new project was a harvard connection,</v>

197
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>but without all the extra crap it would be one based on psychological insights</v>

198
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 1>from facemash on January the 11th,</v>

199
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:47.224
<v Speaker 1>2004.</v>

200
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Look at the quantity registered the new site with his web provider and with that</v>

201
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.180
<v Speaker 1>the facebook Dashcam appeared and the Internet's records for the first.</v>

202
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.090
<v Speaker 1>The very next day is talk about a approach to his friend.</v>

203
00:08:58.091 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Did Water Savarin Zoo,</v>

204
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.010
<v Speaker 1>helped finance the project is everyone agreed to front of thousand dollars and</v>

205
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>it would later say that he owned.</v>

206
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:04.930
<v Speaker 1>He caved in off.</v>

207
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg assured him that they'd be able to use the new site to get light.</v>

208
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That January the 14th is acrobatic.</v>

209
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Finally stopped stringing,</v>

210
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:13.730
<v Speaker 1>render along in a face to face meeting.</v>

211
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.600
<v Speaker 1>He told him that he needed to find a new program at their Indra,</v>

212
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>pleaded with him to stay,</v>

213
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.650
<v Speaker 1>but doug,</v>

214
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>he was already gone and the last forensic weeks before the facebook launched,</v>

215
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it dawned on soccer bag this,</v>

216
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>he was going to fail a module on art in the time of Augustus.</v>

217
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.171
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

218
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>he hatched a classic Zaka Bec scheme in no time at all.</v>

219
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>He knocked up a website and encouraged his classmates,</v>

220
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>do sham materials on it.</v>

221
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Within the 30 minutes of the science going live,</v>

222
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:41.480
<v Speaker 1>it amassed enough materials and function as his own private crib sheet soccer</v>

223
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>bag past the module on February the fourth,</v>

224
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.401
<v Speaker 1>2004.</v>

225
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:48.800
<v Speaker 1>The facebook.com finally went live smart so that you can innovative it looked</v>

226
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 1>shore to be the hottest new site on campus.</v>

227
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.930
<v Speaker 1>As you already know,</v>

228
00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:53.161
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

229
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>these success of Zuckerberg and sovereigns projects,</v>

230
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>it would not be confined to only Harvard.</v>

231
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>The early days of facebook and now legendary.</v>

232
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Over 4,000 people signed up in the first two weeks.</v>

233
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>By May,</v>

234
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>almost 200,000 people are on board.</v>

235
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 1>These figures are still impressive today,</v>

236
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>but in the innocent days of 2004,</v>

237
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 1>they were actually phenomenal.</v>

238
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Does not get the early success.</v>

240
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It was accompanied by a strange defensiveness in the student paper,</v>

241
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:27.451
<v Speaker 1>the Harvard Crimson.</v>

242
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 1>He published an open letter describing how he always went out of his way to help</v>

243
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

244
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>before wheeling around and attacking the renderer with all guns blazing by the</v>

246
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.511
<v Speaker 1>end of the article,</v>

247
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 1>had managed to turn his own intellectual property theft and see a scenario where</v>

248
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>he was the victim,</v>

249
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>not that anything about Zuckerberg,</v>

250
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.430
<v Speaker 1>his outward appearance screamed victim Sama.</v>

251
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>He was renting an apartment in Palo Alto and trying to crack Silicon Valley.</v>

252
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>One of his last acts before leaving Harvard was to ask Severin for an additional</v>

253
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 1>$20,000 for the site and for him to join back in California.</v>

254
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Savrin said yes to the first and to know to the seconds this would not work out</v>

255
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>well for him.</v>

256
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.030
<v Speaker 1>That June the first facebook headquarters appeared in a house on the Jennifer</v>

257
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

258
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>It was the punk into mass that Zika Zuckerberg had always dreamed of.</v>

259
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.720
<v Speaker 1>The teams spent all day drinking,</v>

260
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.100
<v Speaker 1>bear and listening to green day and all night programming,</v>

261
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg,</v>

262
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>even soap to you,</v>

263
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>carrying around a fencing foil,</v>

264
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a genre but reborn as an entitled kid from New York State,</v>

265
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.280
<v Speaker 1>but it would take something more to catapult to the new social network into the</v>

266
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:31.281
<v Speaker 1>big time something or maybe someone that's someone was napster co founder,</v>

267
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Justin Timberlake,</v>

268
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.321
<v Speaker 1>not ready.</v>

269
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>That would be Shawn Parker.</v>

270
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>He's played by Justin Timberlake in the elementary and movie.</v>

271
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Sean Parker just happened to be living a few blocks away from the never ending</v>

272
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 1>facebook Frat party,</v>

273
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but I've always known to suck a bag through sovereign who'd introduced them at a</v>

274
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 1>dinner one day his doctor bag just happened to be walking past his house when</v>

275
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Parker came outside and the to recognize one another.</v>

276
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

277
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>if you want to pinpoint the moments when Zuckerberg went from node with the</v>

278
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>dreams you guy on a course to becoming the world's youngest billionaire,</v>

279
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>well this is probably it.</v>

280
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Pocket became the facebooks connection to silicon valley's big money elite.</v>

281
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.641
<v Speaker 1>It was a connection,</v>

282
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.451
<v Speaker 1>even Zaka bags,</v>

283
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:09.630
<v Speaker 1>habit of arriving at meetings in his pajamas,</v>

284
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>could not break in August,</v>

285
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:13.760
<v Speaker 1>pay co founder Peter Teal became the science first,</v>

286
00:12:13.761 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>a big investor giving them a cash injection of $500,000.</v>

287
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly with that things they were looking very serious and we mean that hair</v>

288
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>in more ways than one around the time he always coming on board.</v>

289
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Savrin was not just being shown the door that he was being thrown through it in</v>

290
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>July of 2004 savarin fruits,</v>

291
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 1>facebook's accounts off to soccer,</v>

292
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>back fail to match his $20,000 investments.</v>

293
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Soccer back responded by transferring all of the facebooks assets to a new</v>

294
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:42.420
<v Speaker 1>version of the company that was headquartered in Delaware.</v>

295
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>This is both cups ever announced and rendered his old stock.</v>

296
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Worthless.</v>

297
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Sovereign would later say that Zuckerberg screwed me by December of 2004,</v>

298
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 1>the facebook was pulling in 1 million users.</v>

299
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Pocket took over as presidents and dinner.</v>

300
00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Early 2005.</v>

301
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>He forced through a name change from this point on the site,</v>

302
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>would simply be known as facebook and they have that.</v>

303
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You have venture capital firms sell apart and is invested.</v>

304
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Twelve point $7,000,000 in facebook.</v>

305
00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 1>The condition though was that the company has to expand beyond just the Ivy</v>

306
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.653
<v Speaker 1>League schools.</v>

307
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.660
<v Speaker 1>That September the site was opened to all colleges and high schools across the</v>

308
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.930
<v Speaker 1>United States by Christmas.</v>

309
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 1>That will five point 5 million users and Zuckerberg,</v>

310
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.460
<v Speaker 1>well Zaka bag was riding a high yahoo at MTV networks were both fighting to buy</v>

311
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>stakes in the rising company and the money was absolutely ruling in the one</v>

312
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 1>major hiccups so far is that pocket had had to resign after the allegedly busted</v>

313
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 1>with cocaine at a party,</v>

314
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but facebook was still on a roll and really the only way was up</v>

315
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.600
<v Speaker 1>by September of 2006.</v>

316
00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Facebook was open to anyone with an email address which set off a phenomenal</v>

317
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.483
<v Speaker 1>growth spat,</v>

318
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.690
<v Speaker 1>but 2006 was also the year we got our first real look at Mark Zuckerberg after</v>

319
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.470
<v Speaker 1>getting burned by his program back in 2004 Norendra hadn't given up,</v>

320
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.950
<v Speaker 1>along with the winklevoss twins and launched a massive lawsuit against</v>

321
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg.</v>

322
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.970
<v Speaker 1>This came to a head just as facebook was conquering the planet.</v>

323
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.691
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

324
00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:12.291
<v Speaker 1>if a soccer bag,</v>

325
00:14:12.291 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>this meant a lot of things from his past,</v>

326
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.590
<v Speaker 1>getting dragged Jonathan legal depositions over to excruciating years.</v>

327
00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:20.160
<v Speaker 1>The press slowly learned down,</v>

328
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Zach,</v>

329
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that I could offer to use this private facebook data to his friends,</v>

330
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:27.410
<v Speaker 1>how had strung Narendra along while stealing his idea and how it even once</v>

331
00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:30.350
<v Speaker 1>harvested passwords from facebook to hack the email accounts.</v>

332
00:14:30.351 --> 00:14:33.980
<v Speaker 1>So journalists at the Harvard Crimson who were sympathetic to Narendra.</v>

333
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.670
<v Speaker 1>It was a litany of wrongdoing.</v>

334
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.090
<v Speaker 1>The source of scandal there could sink a lesser man,</v>

335
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.153
<v Speaker 1>but Zuckerberg,</v>

336
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.340
<v Speaker 1>he was lucky data privacy wasn't something that people really cared about yet</v>

337
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and he still had that aura of rebellious.</v>

338
00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:45.831
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

339
00:14:45.831 --> 00:14:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's hard now to believe that facebook ever had when he eventually settled with</v>

340
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 1>no render out of for $65,000,000,</v>

341
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 1>the world shrugged and went back to Sharon cat memes by 2008,</v>

342
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>facebook had become a global phenomenon.</v>

343
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Aged 23 Zuckerberg was the youngest self made billionaire in history.</v>

344
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Even as the rest of the planets economy detonated in the financial crisis.</v>

345
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Facebook,</v>

346
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it just kept on growing as Zuckerberg had learned himself and his miserable</v>

347
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>freshman year.</v>

348
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 1>No one likes to feel alone,</v>

349
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.360
<v Speaker 1>but if you think the rest of this video is just going to be more of Zach back</v>

350
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.230
<v Speaker 1>becoming richer,</v>

351
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>well casually stabbing colleagues in the back.</v>

352
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

353
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.780
<v Speaker 1>prepare yourself for a bit of a twist while the machiavellian soccer bag is</v>

354
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>certainly a part of this story,</v>

355
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:32.420
<v Speaker 1>this another polyp to one we haven't really touched on in the rush to get to the</v>

356
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:32.931
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

357
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's Zaka bag.</v>

358
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 1>The philanthropist.</v>

359
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>It started with $100,000,000 donation in 2010 to save new x public school system</v>

360
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.850
<v Speaker 1>from collapsing that same year,</v>

361
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] signed the giving pledge,</v>

362
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.930
<v Speaker 1>committing himself to giving half of his fortune away to charity by 2015.</v>

363
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:49.160
<v Speaker 1>He and his future wife here,</v>

364
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be back to in a moment,</v>

365
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 1>we'll be giving 99 percent of that fortune to charitable causes,</v>

366
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>which was a record amount.</v>

367
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.750
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

368
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

369
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.190
<v Speaker 1>we really get to the heart of what makes soccer bag tick and they'd all have the</v>

370
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.450
<v Speaker 1>minute Galatians and scandals.</v>

371
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:05.630
<v Speaker 1>It's worth remembering that at heart he's an idealist.</v>

372
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 1>He really does the ones to make the world a better place,</v>

373
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 1>whether through giving or encouraging us all to connect via facebook,</v>

374
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.970
<v Speaker 1>but he had soon set his sights even higher Zaka.</v>

375
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just want to change the world incrementally.</v>

376
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.510
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to actively shape.</v>

377
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 1>It's to push everyone towards a better future whether they wanted to go there or</v>

378
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:24.710
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

379
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.221
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

380
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 1>it would be this noble impulse that soon sent him and his company on the road to</v>

381
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 1>pr disaster</v>

382
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.480
<v Speaker 1>in October of 2014,</v>

383
00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg steps out of a bright orange helicopter and the tiny Indian</v>

384
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>village of Chan to Ali.</v>

385
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.021
<v Speaker 1>It was a hot day,</v>

386
00:16:46.021 --> 00:16:47.580
<v Speaker 1>the pregnant with humidity,</v>

387
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.430
<v Speaker 1>but Zuckerberg had more in his mind than the heat.</v>

388
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.190
<v Speaker 1>He was in Chengdu duty to change the world.</v>

389
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It had been a good four years to be mom because aca back in 2012 at married his</v>

390
00:16:57.781 --> 00:16:59.340
<v Speaker 1>long time love Priscilla Chan.</v>

391
00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Exactly one day after facebook had gone public for the first time,</v>

392
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.310
<v Speaker 1>about a year after that he would become a father.</v>

393
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the philanthropic work that February is Aka Berg on,</v>

394
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 1>failed something called Internet.org,</v>

395
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.150
<v Speaker 1>which was later renamed free basics,</v>

396
00:17:12.151 --> 00:17:15.840
<v Speaker 1>a vision plan and south where everyone would have access to an internet</v>

397
00:17:15.841 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

398
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Connectivity is a human rice.</v>

399
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.320
<v Speaker 1>It stated he was in India to make that vision a reality.</v>

400
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.360
<v Speaker 1>The idea that Zuckerberg pitch to the school,</v>

401
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:26.070
<v Speaker 1>children of Julie that October,</v>

402
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.113
<v Speaker 1>it was simple,</v>

403
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.450
<v Speaker 1>a free version of the Internet,</v>

404
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:30.840
<v Speaker 1>so that would give them access to 36 sites,</v>

405
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.280
<v Speaker 1>including of course facebook,</v>

406
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 1>as he left the village to Chez and got back in his private helicopter,</v>

407
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Zaka the he must've felt like he was doing God's work bringing digital</v>

408
00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:41.100
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

409
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.510
<v Speaker 1>so the Internet,</v>

410
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.590
<v Speaker 1>barbarians of rural India or any not everyone saw it that way.</v>

411
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.040
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

412
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 1>to some Indian tech journalists sounded a lot like free basics violated net</v>

413
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 1>neutrality.</v>

414
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.291
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

415
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>they kind of saw it as more than digital era colonialism.</v>

416
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Soccer,</v>

417
00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.660
<v Speaker 1>the could of course have countered this narrative by listening to the concerns</v>

418
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:01.650
<v Speaker 1>of these writers,</v>

419
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.700
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't.</v>

420
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

421
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.200
<v Speaker 1>he does what he had done with sovereign ends,</v>

422
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Narendra and roll those years ago.</v>

423
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.850
<v Speaker 1>He struck first miss,</v>

424
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>this was a bad move.</v>

425
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 1>The scandal,</v>

426
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>facebook's attacks stunned journalists.</v>

427
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.990
<v Speaker 1>The Guardian reports that the site automatically enrolls the profiles of users</v>

428
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:23.250
<v Speaker 1>into its empty nest and you're trying to see petitions at one point even signing</v>

429
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 1>up those who had been dead for two years as one Indian generalist potentially</v>

430
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 1>facebook came and shoved it sauce in all phases of the campaign was so</v>

431
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:37.010
<v Speaker 1>manipulative that galvanized India against facebook in February of 2016,</v>

432
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 1>the country effectively outlawed free basics.</v>

433
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Now in the normal run of things,</v>

434
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>this would have just been one misstep in the life of a company.</v>

435
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>One more disaster that would simply be chalked up to experience,</v>

436
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.760
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing about the free basics.</v>

437
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:51.594
<v Speaker 1>Debacle.</v>

438
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg,</v>

439
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>he didn't learn.</v>

440
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 1>What will you took away was that when the next scandal hit,</v>

441
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 1>it would have to fight even harder and it wasn't long before that next scandal</v>

442
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:01.914
<v Speaker 1>arrived,</v>

443
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.910
<v Speaker 1>not six months later,</v>

444
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed's editor,</v>

445
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Craig Silverman,</v>

446
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.300
<v Speaker 1>noticed a string of false stories emerging from one small town in Macedonia,</v>

447
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>but blowing up a big time across all of facebook.</v>

448
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Nearly all involved the presidential candidates.</v>

449
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump,</v>

450
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.831
<v Speaker 1>strangely,</v>

451
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>the stories and the sites they linked do seem to be multiplying and now for all</v>

452
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>of them came from Macedonia as the campaign season drags on other stones to</v>

453
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.400
<v Speaker 1>emerge from further east,</v>

454
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 1>specifically from Russia two years before an engineer at facebook.</v>

455
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It raised the alarm about unusual levels of activity coming from Russia.</v>

456
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:35.160
<v Speaker 1>This is reports.</v>

457
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just been dismissed.</v>

458
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 1>People were wondering whether the Russians were using facebook to spread</v>

459
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:40.794
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>

460
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg didn't think so.</v>

461
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:42.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

462
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.470
<v Speaker 1>November the 10th adjust two days off to donald trump's shock when in the</v>

463
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 1>bitterly contested election,</v>

464
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.720
<v Speaker 1>he made a speech cooling those worried about fake news on his website,</v>

465
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.310
<v Speaker 1>crazy bus.</v>

466
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.870
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't telling the whole truth.</v>

467
00:19:55.050 --> 00:20:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Facebook's own analysis published in 2017 would reveal Russian propaganda groups</v>

468
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 1>that reached 126 million Americans during the election.</v>

469
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Rather than be concerns,</v>

470
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 1>those Aka bag and his board,</v>

471
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 1>they issued denials on January the sixth,</v>

472
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

473
00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:15.210
<v Speaker 1>The CIA declan's that Russia has interfered in the election and to the social</v>

474
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:15.840
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

475
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>particularly facebook,</v>

476
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.530
<v Speaker 1>had played a major role outwardly.</v>

477
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg and his board do.</v>

478
00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 1>They simply kept on repeating that denials,</v>

479
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>but behind the scenes panic,</v>

480
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:27.270
<v Speaker 1>it was beginning to set in throughout April,</v>

481
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 1>facebook launched to crack down on fake news hoping to pull out ahead of the</v>

482
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:31.740
<v Speaker 1>scandal,</v>

483
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but by now it was too late by July,</v>

484
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg was claiming no evidence existed,</v>

485
00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:39.620
<v Speaker 1>that Russian actors bought facebook ads,</v>

486
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Sony for hard evidence to emerge in September that indeed they did,</v>

487
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that Yom kippor he recorded a public video asking for you,</v>

488
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 1>hardly hopes this new to approach would sue over the latest scandal,</v>

489
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

490
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 1>and even biggest scandal was already waiting in the wings on March the 17th,</v>

491
00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:59.950
<v Speaker 1>2018 or joint report by the Guardian,</v>

492
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:00.761
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times,</v>

493
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and Britain's channel for revealed that a firm known as Cambridge Analytica had</v>

494
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.720
<v Speaker 1>used third party apps do harvest the data of 80 million facebook users and that</v>

495
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:14.971
<v Speaker 1>data had been used to try and influence votes everywhere from the US to Great</v>

496
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Britain to Mexico.</v>

497
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.740
<v Speaker 1>This data didn't just come from using suit,</v>

498
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 1>stupidly installed these apps.</v>

499
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Some of the apps automatically harvested the data if that friends as well.</v>

500
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Crucially,</v>

501
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg,</v>

502
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 1>he was aware of this facebook launched open graph software in April of 2010</v>

503
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:33.760
<v Speaker 1>specifically to sell data including the contents of private messages by the way,</v>

504
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 1>to advertisers in May of that year.</v>

505
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg,</v>

506
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 1>he wrote an op Ed in the Washington Post addressing users concerns,</v>

507
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but nothing was done about it until 2014,</v>

508
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and even then the changes,</v>

509
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 1>they weren't applied retroactively.</v>

510
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Any company like Cambridge analytica that already had its claws into your data,</v>

511
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.830
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to let go the resulting scandal.</v>

512
00:21:52.831 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 1>It exploded like a small bomb staining the reputations of both facebook and Mark</v>

513
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg over 10 years after it was first used data from the facebook to hack</v>

514
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:03.730
<v Speaker 1>the emails of Harvard Crimson Journalists.</v>

515
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg was in trouble over a data privacy yet again,</v>

516
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 1>or I need this time.</v>

517
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.060
<v Speaker 1>He had to testify on Capitol Hill.</v>

518
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>On march the 20th,</v>

519
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>

520
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the federal trade commission had launched an inquiry into facebook.</v>

521
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Greg Burson,</v>

522
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you and others had set up similar investigations that Spring moms talk about</v>

523
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>privately told the facebook board that his company was now at war.</v>

524
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Yet still the scandals didn't stop at the time of this video is recording</v>

525
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:30.970
<v Speaker 1>facebook as a company lurching from scandal,</v>

526
00:22:30.971 --> 00:22:33.910
<v Speaker 1>the scandal dragging it's found founder in its wake.</v>

527
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:34.831
<v Speaker 1>Among other things,</v>

528
00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg burgs digital utopia has been accused of facilitating ethnic</v>

529
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:43.060
<v Speaker 1>cleansing and Myeloma aiding the harassment of survivors of mass shootings and</v>

530
00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 1>spreading negative propaganda about George Soros aged any 34.</v>

531
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg has finally lost whatever veneer of cool he and his creation</v>

532
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 1>once had rich,</v>

533
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.611
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

534
00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and utterly convinced of his own rightness.</v>

535
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.271
<v Speaker 1>He has refused,</v>

536
00:22:58.271 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 1>cools to step down from facebook's board or do anything but to keep on fighting</v>

537
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 1>isolation in the eye of a growing hurricane of scandal.</v>

538
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>He no longer seems like the punk nerd who appended communication,</v>

539
00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:14.550
<v Speaker 1>but like king lear raging at the sky as world crumbles around him.</v>

540
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg story,</v>

541
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not ovaries,</v>

542
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.191
<v Speaker 1>not yet 40,</v>

543
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:23.191
<v Speaker 1>but his biography as it stands today is one of wanting a strange morality tale</v>

544
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 1>of Hubris theft and misplaced good intentions for our Internet age.</v>

545
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Whether the final act is one that ends in Dhaka,</v>

546
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 1>bugs,</v>

547
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.031
<v Speaker 1>redemption,</v>

548
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:35.050
<v Speaker 1>or as destination is something that only time will tell.</v>
