00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>The world outside of central Maine always never got to know Stephen King for his</v>

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>wife's diligence.</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Indeck confidence in her husband's the book that launched a million pages might</v>

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>never have come into being when his wife Tabitha rescued the start of the</v>

5
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>manuscripts of Carrie from the trash and insisted her husband finished.</v>

6
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>His king was working as an English teacher and writing on the site.</v>

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Some of those judgements was absolutely right.</v>

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Carrie was a smash hit and Stephen King is now one of the world's most famous</v>

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>and prolific authors.</v>

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>So what's the story behind the stories?</v>

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>that still even into his life,</v>

13
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King was born in Portland,</v>

14
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Maine,</v>

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>the largest city of the mostly rural state that serves as the setting for so</v>

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>many of his famous stories.</v>

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Steven was the second son born to Nellie ends,</v>

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Donald King,</v>

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but the family of four seam became a family of three when steven was only two</v>

20
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>years old and his brother only for that father went out telling the family he</v>

21
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>was buying a pack of cigarettes and he never returned.</v>

22
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>King's mother worked several jobs moving with the boys from Maine and going from</v>

23
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>state to state to falling into work and the place that she could afford to live</v>

24
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>and raise our two boys,</v>

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>but Maine,</v>

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>it was home and it's where the family eventually settled for good.</v>

27
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>When the family moved back to Maine,</v>

28
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have indoor plumbing,</v>

29
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>and this was the 19 sixties king's life growing up.</v>

30
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>It was a far cry from the wealth that he has now with King.</v>

31
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Didn't see his childhood as exceptional or out of the ordinary that he does</v>

32
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge.</v>

33
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>He's always liked scary things.</v>

34
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>My childhood was pretty ordinary.</v>

35
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:41.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>except from a very early age.</v>

37
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be scattered.</v>

38
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.963
<v Speaker 1>I just did.</v>

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I was scared afterwards.</v>

40
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to light on because I was scared.</v>

41
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>There was something in the closet.</v>

42
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>My imagination was very active.</v>

43
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Even at a young age.</v>

44
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Some have said that king might also be inspired to write such horrifying stories</v>

45
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>by a childhood events.</v>

46
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even remember.</v>

47
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>According to mum,</v>

48
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I had gone off to play at a neighbor's house,</v>

49
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>a house that was near a railroad line.</v>

50
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>About an hour after I left,</v>

51
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I came back,</v>

52
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.981
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

53
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>is white as a ghost.</v>

54
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I would not speak for the rest of the day.</v>

55
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I would not tell her why I'm not waiting to be picked up or phones that I wanted</v>

56
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:14.754
<v Speaker 1>to come home.</v>

57
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I would not tell her why chums,</v>

58
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>mum hadn't walked me back,</v>

59
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but it allowed me to come alone.</v>

60
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that the kid I had been playing with had been run over by a freight</v>

61
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>train while playing on or crossing the tracks.</v>

62
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>

63
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>my mother told me they'd picked up the pieces in a wicker basket.</v>

64
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>As True Isaac is that events Mr Bennett was not the only explanation for kings,</v>

65
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>that vivid imagination of friends of the king's tell stories about how the</v>

66
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>family was well known for their attention to literature.</v>

67
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>If their mother couldn't find or afford a babysitter should leave her son's</v>

68
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>alone with the expectation they would read aloud to each other.</v>

69
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Kings and love of stories and the written word was fostered from an early age</v>

70
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>and that tradition,</v>

71
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it stuck.</v>

72
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Gang and his wife Tabitha also made their own children read aloud to each other</v>

73
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>and to them he'd even record them on cassettes to make the family that own of</v>

74
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>audio books growing up.</v>

75
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>King also write material for his brother's newsletter called Dave's rag.</v>

76
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>They made copies on a mimeograph machine and distributed it to their friends,</v>

77
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but king was unable to move me on just writing for his siblings and he was the</v>

78
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>last up in 1965 when he was still in high school.</v>

79
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>King was published in comics.</v>

80
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Review the story was right in line with the frightening plots that we all know</v>

81
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>king for today can.</v>

82
00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You had been working as a grave digger and money as a teenager.</v>

83
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>The job inspired him to write a story called I was a teenage grave robbing and</v>

84
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>its publication was his first taste of published success.</v>

85
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>The only downside was that he didn't get paid for the work is first paid.</v>

86
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Publication didn't come until he was in college and he earns $35 for a story</v>

87
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>called the glass floor.</v>

88
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Congratulated from Lisbon falls high school.</v>

89
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>The high school in the town that later became the setting for portions of the</v>

90
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:46.481
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

91
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

92
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>2163.</v>

93
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Lisbon falls was a mill town and King spent time working in the towns mill when</v>

94
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>he was a teenager</v>

95
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 1>after graduation.</v>

96
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 1>King had aspirations to be a writeup,</v>

97
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.700
<v Speaker 1>so we headed north to the University of men or no to earn a degree in English</v>

98
00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

99
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.231
<v Speaker 1>While in college,</v>

100
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>King was a columnist for the college paper,</v>

101
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.810
<v Speaker 1>was outspoken against the Vietnam War and worked in the college library.</v>

102
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the library is now home to many of kings papers.</v>

103
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.940
<v Speaker 1>It's also where he met his wife,</v>

104
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Tabitha was looking for a book in the stacks and king passed by and struck up a</v>

105
00:04:26.781 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>conversation with her and four years later the literary recouple had graduated,</v>

106
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.753
<v Speaker 1>had a daughter,</v>

107
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.690
<v Speaker 1>and they were married.</v>

108
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Woking had been rising in college.</v>

109
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:38.030
<v Speaker 1>He was far from being able to support himself and the growing family just by</v>

110
00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:38.600
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

111
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.410
<v Speaker 1>He Tabitha and their daughter Naomi web living in a trailer outside of Bangor</v>

112
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 1>and king was working two jobs.</v>

113
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>He was teaching English at Hampton Academy and in the summers was pumping gas at</v>

114
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the local station while also working shifts at a laundromat.</v>

115
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Tabitha took shifts at a Dunkin donuts and they struggled to get by,</v>

116
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.650
<v Speaker 1>but it can always made time to write.</v>

117
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Even in the cramped quarters of the family's trailer,</v>

118
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 1>he made a point to set aside space for a writing desk and the typewriter,</v>

119
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.510
<v Speaker 1>2000 words a day was his goal and that's the goal that he stands by today.</v>

120
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Eventually king earned two teaching certificates and was able to put his college</v>

121
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:14.750
<v Speaker 1>education to use as a teacher at Hampton Academy.</v>

122
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 1>The work still wasn't what he wanted to be doing,</v>

123
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

124
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.900
<v Speaker 1>It was writing that he loved and writing,</v>

125
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.823
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to honor.</v>

126
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Living from writing simply has always been his purpose in life as he explains.</v>

127
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing else I was made to do that was made to write stories and I</v>

128
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.320
<v Speaker 1>love to write stories.</v>

129
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 1>That's why I do it.</v>

130
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I really can't imagine doing anything else and it's like cons.</v>

131
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Imagine and not doing what I do though it took years of effort.</v>

132
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.310
<v Speaker 1>His big break did come off the top of a fish,</v>

133
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:41.990
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of carry out of the trash.</v>

134
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 1>In 1973 king finish the book and sent it off to a publisher.</v>

135
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.950
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't confident about its chances of being published,</v>

136
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

137
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.950
<v Speaker 1>my considered opinion was the diet written,</v>

138
00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.960
<v Speaker 1>the world's all time loser.</v>

139
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>The family wasn't doing well financially when he sent Carrie and then as they</v>

140
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even afford a phone,</v>

141
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>so he got the news via telegram.</v>

142
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.340
<v Speaker 1>He'd be receiving a $2,500 advance and double date would be publishing carry.</v>

143
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Then even better news came.</v>

144
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>The paperback rights were sold for $400,000 and without Kinkade,</v>

145
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>quit teaching and begin writing full time and his family would be better off</v>

146
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>than they ever debt to.</v>

147
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the book.</v>

148
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.080
<v Speaker 1>It was an absolute smash hits.</v>

149
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Within the next year,</v>

150
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>a million copies were sold and only three years later it was made into an</v>

151
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>academy award winning movie.</v>

152
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King was now officially a writer and an American celebrity,</v>

153
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>but success did not mean the king settled into a completely untroubled life.</v>

154
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>As he got to writing,</v>

155
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>cranking out books like misery and pet cemetery,</v>

156
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 1>he was drinking heavily and so he.</v>

157
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.013
<v Speaker 1>We had a problem.</v>

158
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Can they told rolling stone?</v>

159
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in the house drank,</v>

160
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 1>but me,</v>

161
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>my wife would have a glass of wine and that was all so I went into the garage</v>

162
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>one night and the trashcan that was set aside for beer cans was full to the top.</v>

163
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It had been empty the week before.</v>

164
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking like a case of beer a night and I thought,</v>

165
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm an alcoholic.</v>

166
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>That was probably 78,</v>

167
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>79.</v>

168
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

169
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I've got to be really careful because if somebody says you're drinking too much,</v>

170
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.873
<v Speaker 1>you have to quit.</v>

171
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to.</v>

172
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>He knew he had a problem,</v>

173
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't stop drinking.</v>

174
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

175
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>you took it one step further.</v>

176
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>In the late seventies,</v>

177
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>king started doing cocaine using this at night while he was writing.</v>

178
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

179
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>he and Tabitha had three kids and he knew his addictions.</v>

180
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>We're taking a toll both on his family and on his writing.</v>

181
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>He attributes the length of Tommy knockers to cocaine and looking back,</v>

182
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I said the book could have been half the length if so much of it had to been</v>

183
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>inspired purely by his drugged up energy,</v>

184
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>and he has also said that he doesn't even remember writing cue job so bad was</v>

185
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>his consumption of alcohol and drugs during the eighties.</v>

186
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.660
<v Speaker 1>He says there's one novel Qj that I barely remember writing.</v>

187
00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It's all I don't say that with pride or shame.</v>

188
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I knew with a vague sense of sorrow loss.</v>

189
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I liked that book.</v>

190
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember enjoying the good parts.</v>

191
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I put them down on the page in the shining and misery,</v>

192
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>both carrie and undercurrent of his reference to his struggles.</v>

193
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Jack's Ahrens is an alcoholic and the shining and king has described the</v>

194
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>antagonist of misery as essentially the personification of cocaine.</v>

195
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the late eighties when Tabitha threatened to leave him and the</v>

196
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>family stage two dramatic intervention that king things off.</v>

197
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>His acts of the intervention has family displayed drug paraphernalia,</v>

198
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 1>orange pills that they had collected from the trash gang with the magnitude of</v>

199
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>his problem laid out in front of his eyes and in front of his family and</v>

200
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

201
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>made the decision to get sober.</v>

202
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Now he's been sober for nearly three decades during the 19 nineties and into the</v>

203
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>21st century,</v>

204
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>can continue to be one of the world's most prolific and the well known writers</v>

205
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.651
<v Speaker 1>is book spoons,</v>

206
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>movies and miniseries,</v>

207
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>and over 350 million copies of his books have been sold.</v>

208
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 1>After it became so popular,</v>

209
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>King took the step of publishing under a pseudonym,</v>

210
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Richard Bachman.</v>

211
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to see if he could still get books published and towns for themselves</v>

212
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>without his now famous names splashed across the front.</v>

213
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>It turns out well,</v>

214
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.780
<v Speaker 1>he totally could.</v>

215
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 1>The first book he published under the name Richard Bachman was rage set in</v>

216
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:54.930
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>

217
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>familiar weld of main high school.</v>

218
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>The book tells the story.</v>

219
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>You have a teenager who engages in violent acts at his school.</v>

220
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>He sets his locker on fire.</v>

221
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:02.641
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

222
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Algebra teacher and the tax and other students with a wrench.</v>

223
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>In 1977,</v>

224
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>it was a figment of kings imagination,</v>

225
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but in the late eighties and nineties and nineties,</v>

226
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the book unfortunately started to resemble actual occurrences at schools across</v>

227
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

228
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>In 1997,</v>

229
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 1>after a student's shot,</v>

230
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>eight people at a prayer meeting in Kentucky,</v>

231
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it was discovered that he had a copy of rage and his locker disturbed by this</v>

232
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 1>king lost his publisher to take the book out of Prince.</v>

233
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

234
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 1>rage remains out of friends</v>

235
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 1>even as his success group king remain living in Maine.</v>

236
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 1>The family owns a home in Bangor on a human level near the lakes.</v>

237
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>For the summit,</v>

238
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 1>it was near the home in level that king's life almost ended.</v>

239
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>In 1999,</v>

240
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>king was taking a walk along one of the winding would it roads that aren't so</v>

241
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>familiar,</v>

242
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.630
<v Speaker 1>part of means landscape.</v>

243
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Then events smashed into him from behind was knocks off the roads and into a</v>

244
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>ditch.</v>

245
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Witnesses said he was in a heap and it was clear his leg was broken.</v>

246
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.640
<v Speaker 1>His glasses flew off and landed in the van that hit him at the hospital.</v>

247
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>We went to multiple surgeries and had to do physical therapy as a part of his</v>

248
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:13.974
<v Speaker 1>recovery.</v>

249
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Brian Smith,</v>

250
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 1>the driver who hits King,</v>

251
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 1>had a track record of driving infractions,</v>

252
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Speaker 1>including a Dui.</v>

253
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>The king accident was blamed on Smith as dog distracting him,</v>

254
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 1>causing him to swerve into the author.</v>

255
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Smith received a six month jail sentence that was later suspended and had his</v>

256
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>license revoked for a year.</v>

257
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 1>King was pretty upset at this.</v>

258
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>He wanted Smith's license revoked for life given his history of bad driving.</v>

259
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Only a year after the accident,</v>

260
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Smith was found dead in his trailer at the age of 43.</v>

261
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 1>He died of a painkiller overdose and then the twist of fate that seems straight</v>

262
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:44.454
<v Speaker 1>out of a king novel.</v>

263
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>He died on king's birthday.</v>

264
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>September 21st kings sustained horrific injuries in the accident,</v>

265
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.880
<v Speaker 1>but resumed writing one a month after being released from the hospital.</v>

266
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.120
<v Speaker 1>He finished the highly regarded on writing and didn't do thousand.</v>

267
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>The book was published like 2002.</v>

268
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>King decided that he simply didn't have the strength to keep writing as he had</v>

269
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>in the past where you had previously sat and typed for hours at a time,</v>

270
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 1>it now person to sit for long periods.</v>

271
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Addiction had also become part of his life again.</v>

272
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>After the accident,</v>

273
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:13.431
<v Speaker 1>he took oxygen,</v>

274
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>comes in to deal with the pain from his injuries,</v>

275
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>and he became addicted to it as he had a decade earlier.</v>

276
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>It was able to overcome the addiction and to live life once again,</v>

277
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:22.640
<v Speaker 1>so belief,</v>

278
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but I think in lieu of the written word,</v>

279
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.780
<v Speaker 1>there's ultimately proved to be strong for his post accident injuries and</v>

280
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>struggles and so king returns to his craft.</v>

281
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>He has said this,</v>

282
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>he literally needs to write in order to live and what would happen if you didn't</v>

283
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 1>write?</v>

284
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

285
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.933
<v Speaker 1>I'd be debt.</v>

286
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I would have drank myself to death old drug myself to death or committed suicide</v>

287
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 1>or some goddamn thing.</v>

288
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

289
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>since this accident he's published dozens of stories and books including Mr.</v>

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>2163 and under the dome a die hard red sox fan.</v>

292
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Like so many of his New England,</v>

293
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.831
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King,</v>

294
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>also Carrie wrote a book after the Red Sox,</v>

295
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>2004 world series win faithful to die hard.</v>

296
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Boston red sox fans chronic the historic 2004 season shared the story of the</v>

297
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>emotional roller coaster king and so many other red sox fans road throughout the</v>

298
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 1>summer and fall of 2004 and a feather display of his eclectic interests and</v>

299
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 1>abilities can dabbles in music he played,</v>

300
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>gets off the rock bottom,</v>

301
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>remainders of and he was other members you might recognize to you anytime Dave</v>

302
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Berry and migrating a few of the other celebrities who joined king on stage.</v>

303
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Even actually Carrie wrote a musical with John Mellencamp build as a southern</v>

304
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>gothic supernatural musical ghost brothers of [inaudible] county opens and ran</v>

305
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>for a month at the alliance theatre in Atlanta.</v>

306
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Can is now 70 years old,</v>

307
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't run out of ideas.</v>

308
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

309
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 1>he and his son one just released a co written book in 2017.</v>

310
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.140
<v Speaker 1>he's incredibly wealthy.</v>

312
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.810
<v Speaker 1>He writes in sells books at a breathtaking pace,</v>

313
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.570
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't use his wealth to amass stuff.</v>

314
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.280
<v Speaker 1>The antifa owned three houses,</v>

315
00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.720
<v Speaker 1>two in Maine and one in Florida.</v>

316
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the house in Maine that is the most iconic located in Bangor.</v>

317
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge old Victorian surrounded by a wrought iron fence,</v>

318
00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:13.110
<v Speaker 1>decorated with bats from the outside.</v>

319
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.250
<v Speaker 1>The house is exactly where one would expect Stephen King to live on the inside.</v>

320
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It has an indoor swimming pool and a huge on the ground library.</v>

321
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.070
<v Speaker 1>The houses are extravagance by everyday standards,</v>

322
00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:26.850
<v Speaker 1>but they really all the primary way king prefers to spend money on himself and</v>

323
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Tabitha.</v>

324
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a clothes person.</v>

325
00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a boat person.</v>

326
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.870
<v Speaker 1>We do have a house in Florida,</v>

327
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.640
<v Speaker 1>but we live in Maine for Christ's sake.</v>

328
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a trendy community or anything.</v>

329
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.150
<v Speaker 1>His houses are beautiful,</v>

330
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but they don't use all of his money so well.</v>

331
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.390
<v Speaker 1>What does he do with it all?</v>

332
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

333
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.610
<v Speaker 1>he gives it away my sleep more.</v>

334
00:13:41.611 --> 00:13:45.300
<v Speaker 1>He invested in projects that support his interests and just community and music.</v>

335
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Fan King has also pat just radio stations in Maine,</v>

336
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.140
<v Speaker 1>a huge baseball fan.</v>

337
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.810
<v Speaker 1>He funded the construction of a little league field in Bangalore.</v>

338
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.270
<v Speaker 1>The field is now known as the field of screens,</v>

339
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.370
<v Speaker 1>a tip of the hat to the fields funder.</v>

340
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Together he and Tabitha run these Steven and Tabitha King Foundation,</v>

341
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.780
<v Speaker 1>libraries and colleges,</v>

342
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:04.470
<v Speaker 1>especially the University of Maine in the Bangor Public Library has benefited</v>

343
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:07.260
<v Speaker 1>from King's philanthropy means historical society,</v>

344
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.160
<v Speaker 1>far departments,</v>

345
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:12.420
<v Speaker 1>arts organizations and hospitals have also been beneficiaries of the kings.</v>

346
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.480
<v Speaker 1>In 1,801 speech at Vassar college king made his view on generosity and charity</v>

347
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:18.660
<v Speaker 1>clear to his audience.</v>

348
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Should you give away what you have?</v>

349
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.053
<v Speaker 1>Of course you should.</v>

350
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I want you to consider making your lives one long gift to others and why not?</v>

351
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.030
<v Speaker 1>All you have is on loan anyway.</v>

352
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.610
<v Speaker 1>All he wants to get asked at the getting place from the Maserati.</v>

353
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:33.180
<v Speaker 1>You may dream about the retirement fund some broker will trying to sell you on.</v>

354
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.100
<v Speaker 1>None of that is real well.</v>

355
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That last is what you pass on.</v>

356
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.850
<v Speaker 1>The rest is smoke and mirrors.</v>

357
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.050
<v Speaker 1>In that same speech,</v>

358
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.830
<v Speaker 1>he discussed natural resources and his dislike of the George W dot Bush</v>

359
00:14:43.831 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>administration with the advent of twitter in the years to follow king has an</v>

360
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:50.010
<v Speaker 1>even wider audience to share his political views with.</v>

361
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.260
<v Speaker 1>He's taken on president trump,</v>

362
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 1>vice,</v>

363
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 1>which are announcing that the president wasn't allowed to see the new version of</v>

364
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>it when it hit theaters in 2017.</v>

365
00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.780
<v Speaker 1>He is also made clear in very profane language and repeat it here,</v>

366
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.800
<v Speaker 1>what he thinks of the president and his administration.</v>

367
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King is a national figure in his own right.</v>

368
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.843
<v Speaker 1>For 30 years,</v>

369
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 1>he has been affecting the conversation around pop culture.</v>

370
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 1>His books sell by the millions and his movies rake in millions of dollars and</v>

371
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:16.460
<v Speaker 1>win Academy Awards.</v>

372
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Growing up,</v>

373
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>he knew he wanted to write,</v>

374
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>but he never wanted to do it.</v>

375
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 1>To achieve the wealth and fame,</v>

376
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.070
<v Speaker 1>he's now a mast is reasoning is much simpler and it remains his mentor.</v>

377
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.923
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

378
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>writing isn't about making money,</v>

379
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:28.671
<v Speaker 1>getting famous,</v>

380
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:29.331
<v Speaker 1>getting dates,</v>

381
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:29.961
<v Speaker 1>getting laid,</v>

382
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>or making friends.</v>

383
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

384
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 1>it's about enriching the lives of those who will read your work and enriching</v>

385
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 1>your own life as well.</v>

386
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 1>For over three decades from his home,</v>

387
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 1>tucked away in the northeast corner of the United States,</v>

388
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King has been able to live out his childhood dream to write for a</v>

389
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:46.580
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

390
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.151
<v Speaker 1>In doing so,</v>

391
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:48.500
<v Speaker 1>he's brought many of us nightmares,</v>

392
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.311
