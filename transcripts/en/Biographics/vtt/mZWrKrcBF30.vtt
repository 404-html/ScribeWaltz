00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.100
In the summer of 1976 the city of New York was thrown into a state of terror.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.090
A mad man was on the loose,
wandering the streets and killing people at random.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.280
This was a killer who loved publicity,

4
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.610
sending vicious torn zing Latins to the police and the media.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.610
Each one was signed with the Monica son of Sam.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.650
When feet finally caught up with the monster,

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
he was revealed to be a chubby introvert by the name of David Berkowitz.

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
In the biographics video.
Today,
we discover his story.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.700
<v 0>The trials who would become the son of Sam was born or Richard David Falco.</v>

11
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.920
On June the first 1953 his mother,
Betty Broder,

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.780
had been previously married to a man named Tony Falchi,

13
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.910
but when he left her for another woman,

14
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.180
she began a relationship with a married man.
Names Joseph Kleinman.

15
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.340
Bessie Antonio already had a child,
Rosslyn,

16
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:59.100
and when Kleinman found out that she was pregnant again,

17
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.440
he pressured her to give the baby up for adoption.

18
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.950
It appears that he also for to Betty from giving the child his name,

19
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.190
which is why she gave the trials how former husband's last name.

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.120
A few days after birth,
Richard was adopted by a middle aged couple names.

21
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.410
Nathan ends Peled Berkowitz who lived in New York,
says Bronx neighborhood.

22
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.860
The Berkowitz is owned a hardware store which occupied a large portion of

23
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.560
Nathan's time.
He was never close with his adopted son.

24
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.790
He be called David considering the adoption to be a mistake as David was her

25
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:27.480
only child.

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.620
Poe was extremely close to the boy though she indulged Davidson's let him get

27
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.420
away with things that need shouldn't have.

28
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.650
David developed into a difficult child.
He was hyperactive,
mischievous,

29
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.520
and ornery.

30
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.330
He was a bulky child since quickly learns that he could use his size to his

31
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:44.640
advantage and Lord it over other children.

32
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.660
He showed little interest in schooling and through a combination of truancy and

33
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.800
feigned illnesses.
He missed class a lot of the time.
When he was seven years old,

34
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.410
David was hit by a car and he suffered head injuries.

35
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.740
It's unclear whether this resulted in any longterm effects.

36
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270
Soon after though he started to show signs of a fascination with fire.

37
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.410
He began burning bugs and advanced up starting fires around his neighborhood.

38
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.110
This didn't bring him to the attention of the authorities,

39
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.160
though his adoptive parents did take him to see a psychotherapist when he was 14

40
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.360
David's life was turned upside down with the death of his adoptive mother.

41
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.150
Paula had been fighting breast cancer for two years.

42
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.590
Paul was the only person with him.

43
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.580
David had a close relationship and he was shocked to watch her decline as she

44
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.860
went through chemotherapy treatments,
her death,

45
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.070
it was a crushing blow and the year after his mother's death,

46
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:34.050
David became increasingly introverted.

47
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.190
His schoolwork suffer drastically as he fell into a dock.
Depression.

48
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.950
He had no relationship with his father and things worse,

49
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.480
and when Joseph remarried,

50
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.300
his new step mother was even more distant than his father.

51
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.510
When the family relocated to Boynton beach near Miami,
Florida,

52
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:49.560
David's on isolation.

53
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.830
It became complete with no friends and no family connection.

54
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:56.130
He created a fantasy world in order to cope with his loneliness.

55
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.090
In 1971 that the age of 18 David found a means to escape is dismal life with his

56
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.540
father and stepmother.
He joined the army and is off to basic training.

57
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.370
He was sent to Korea all me life.

58
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.920
It was transformative for the troubled young men.

59
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.280
He seemed to respond well to the discipline that it provided and generally

60
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.640
equipped him well.
He trained as a marksman and became a good shot.

61
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.990
In 1974 he was honorably discharged after leaving the army,

62
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.170
David returns New York.
Here.
He was competing on his own.

63
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.520
He used money to save during a Zombie is to rents and apartments in the Bronx

64
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.540
and took classes at Bronx community college.
People remember him at this time,

65
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.310
isn't angry and argumentative,

66
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.490
young man who shun dissociation with others to support himself.

67
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:38.910
He worked a number of odd jobs including mail sorters,

68
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:40.510
security guard and cab driver.

69
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.230
Though very quiet Berkowitz quickly came to the attention of his neighbors and

70
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.490
the local police departments.

71
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.390
He would instigate petty disputes and escalate them with personal threats.

72
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.940
A man who lived on the floor below deputy police.

73
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.920
Sheriff Charles Glassman received 400 and threats from Berkowitz in his early

74
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.790
twenties.
Berkowitz connected with this Beth mouth up.

75
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.650
Hey began regular visits with Betty and his half sister Rosalyn.
However,

76
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.650
when he finds out that Betsy had given him up for adoption after succumbing to

77
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:09.520
pressure from his Beth father,
he did not react very well.
In fact,

78
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:13.450
he cut the two women out of his life completely,
never visited again.

79
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.570
Then in 1974 Berkowitz's fascination with fire resurfaced over the next three

80
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:22.960
years,
he sat more than 1,500 files around New York City.

81
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.800
David diligently recorded the details of each Austin and his journal referring

82
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:31.330
to himself as the phantom of the Bronx fire lighting gave him some control over

83
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:34.510
a situation that he couldn't find anywhere else in his life.

84
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.370
In 1975 Berkowitz develops another fascination and this time it was with the

85
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.060
occult.

86
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.350
After reading the Satanic Bible by ons and Lovey the founder of the Church of

87
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.430
Satan,
he became convinced that he was being controlled by evil spirits.

88
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.950
In late November,
1975 Berkowitz wrote a letter to his father in it.

89
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.740
He says it's cold and gloomy here in New York,

90
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.760
but that's okay because the weather fits my mood.
Gloomy Dad,

91
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.660
the world is getting dark now.
An unfun laser.
On Christmas Eve,

92
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:13.950
he took hold of a hunting knife and headed down to to satisfy his blood lust.

93
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.680
His first victim was a woman coming out of a grocery store.

94
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.130
Berkowitz stabbed several times before she managed to run away.

95
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.160
He then came across a 15 year old by the name of Michelle Foreman.

96
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.620
She was stabbed six times,
but for telephone attack.
That runs,

97
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.970
made it to the safety of a nearby apartment.
At the end of January,

98
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:34.740
1976 Berkowitz relocated from the Bronx to a rental house in Yonkers,

99
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.280
has landlords and a German shepherd dog,
which barked incessantly.

100
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.640
Berkowitz would lay to claim that this dog was possessed by Satan and it's

101
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.100
barking,
was commands for him to kill women.

102
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.160
At the time he was working a night shift job as a security guard.

103
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.060
He recalled that the constant barking almost caused him to take his own life.

104
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.991
After three months.

105
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:56.070
That noise was too much for backer since he moved to an apartment at 35 pine

106
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:57.920
street at Yonkers.
As it turns out,

107
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:01.910
he was unable to avoid the barking of dogs and he took this as a sign that Satan

108
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.410
was driving him to murder.

109
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.740
He used a Molotov cocktail to kill the dog belonging to his neighbor,

110
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.220
a man named Sam car.
When this didn't work,
he shot the dog.

111
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.000
Berkowitz was convinced that Sam car was possessed by the Devil Lens.

112
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.510
It was from him that he came up with a name,
son of Sam.

113
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.070
His two botched knife attacks,

114
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.490
convinced buck widths that he needed a more effective means of killing.

115
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.930
By June of 1976 he had built out a formidable arsenal of firearms that included

116
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.460
a 44 caliber revolver.

117
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.020
I commando mark three rifle at Glenfield rifle with a telescopic sight charter,

118
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:37.670
arms,
ar seven explorer shotgun and a 12 gauge ethica ds slash shotgun.

119
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.770
Towards the end of June,

120
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.640
1976 Berkovitz quit his job as a security guard and began driving for the co op

121
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.690
city taxi company,
but their job,
it didn't last long.
By the end of July,

122
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:51.700
he was working a day job as an installer of air conditioning ducts Berkowitz's

123
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.830
first kill and it came on July the 29th 1976 he left his apartment via the fire

124
00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:01.070
escape.
Shortly before 1:00 AM with this 44 Canada handgun in a paper bag.

125
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.770
He hops into his car and began cruising for a victim.

126
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.490
He came across 18 year old Donna Lauria and said 19 year old friends,

127
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:10.430
Jody valency talking in a car outside Donna's apartment.

128
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.390
Berkowitz approached on a side window,
squatted down into a firing position,

129
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.800
holding the gun with both hands,
emptied the chamber.
Donna was shot and killed.

130
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.790
Jody was wounded and she reacted by screaming and desperately wrong in the car

131
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:27.050
horn.
Jody survived with his gun.
Empty Berkowitz melted into the night.

132
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.560
He was filled with the euphoria that he had never known before and his addiction

133
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.660
to murder was well underway.

134
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.690
The next attack.

135
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.010
It came at three months later on October the 23rd Berkowitz was again cruising

136
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:47.730
for a victim in the dead of the night.
He was driving down a street in flushing,

137
00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:51.000
Queens when he spotted two people in a Red Ford Galaxy,

138
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.760
one of them had long black hair,
which he found attractive.

139
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.660
He began following them and when they came to a stop,
he parked behind them.

140
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.653
Burkowitz said,

141
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.730
set his sights on 20 year old called a narrow and his 18 year old date,

142
00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:03.660
Rosemarie Keenan,

143
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.720
who happened to be the daughter of a New York City police officer.

144
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.700
Following the same pattern of his first murder,

145
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.590
Berkowitz approached the passenger window,

146
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.470
pulled out his handgun and fired five times.

147
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.320
One of the bullets smashed into calls,
had and uninjured.

148
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:19.830
Rosemary managed to escape the car and flee.
When backwards left,

149
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:22.560
she returned and drive call to the hospital.
Amazingly,

150
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.090
he survived with doctors having to insert a metal plate into a skull and month

151
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.410
later Berkowitz struck again.

152
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.200
This time his victims were a couple of teenage girls,

153
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.460
Joanne Amino and Donald and Marcy.
They were on their way home from the movies.

154
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.390
Buckowitz walked behind them and as they stood on the stoop of Joanne's house

155
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:43.410
talking,
he opened up with his handgun.
Then he disappeared.

156
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.560
Bullets tore through the bodies of both girls,
but neither was killed.

157
00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:50.190
Although Joanne was paralyzed from the waist down the attacks,

158
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.870
they continued on January the 30th 1977 Berkowitz shot and killed Kristine.

159
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.800
He was just seeing the movie rocky with our boyfriends as with most of the

160
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.700
previous attacks,

161
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.750
the couple of web sitting in that car when Berkowitz I've been fired.

162
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.340
Then on March the eighth he killed a 20 year olds,

163
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.760
Bulgarian immigrants by the name of the Jenya Vauxhall Rakeon.

164
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.630
Virginia was walking home from Columbia University when she came face to face

165
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:13.464
with Berkowitz,

166
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.640
a shot her in the face at point blank range and then left her to die on the

167
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:18.474
sidewalk.

168
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.980
Then on April the 17th he attacks Valentina Syriani and Alexander or so as they

169
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.360
sat in their car at 3:00 AM Syriani died at the scene.
While isyeah died.

170
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.253
Hours later,

171
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.440
police came to the scene and they found a letter that had been left by the

172
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:35.520
killer.
It read in part,
I'm a monster.
I am the son of Sam.

173
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.750
I feel like an outsider.
I am on a different wavelength than everybody else.

174
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.560
Programs to kill.
However,
just stop me.
You must kill me.

175
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.880
I am the monster Beelzebub the Chubby BMF.
I love to hunt,

176
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.280
prowling the streets,
looking for fat game,

177
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:53.820
tasty meat that women of Queens or prettiest of all

178
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.260
my now the entire city of New York was in an uproar fair ever.

179
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:07.700
The next attack by the son of Sam led to a rush on handgun sales and a dramatic

180
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:09.860
emptying of nighttime entertainment venues.

181
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.110
The information that the majority of victims had,
long,

182
00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.660
dark hair led to an overnight hairstyle,
changes.

183
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.240
Women rushed to get their haircut and then died.

184
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.720
The media was all over the story with coverage going global,

185
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.590
but still the attacks continued with Schilling regularity.
Berkowitz.

186
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.490
The next struck on June the 26th 1977 Judy placido,

187
00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:33.320
age 17 and Sal Lupo age 20 we're setting a new postcard around 3:00 AM when

188
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:35.060
Berkowitz attacked in his usual way.

189
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.030
Placido was shot three times while Lupo was shot.

190
00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:43.031
Once both survived amongst the lazy or tags or Bobby Vr Lanza and Stacy

191
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.760
Moskowitz both age 20 again Berkowitz fine through the passenger car window,

192
00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:50.320
striking both of his victims in the head of the island's Ayp survived the,

193
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.680
he lost 90% of his vision,
but Stacy Moskovitz died two days later.

194
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.900
She marked the last victim of the son of Sam on March 30th,

195
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.410
1977 media hysteria was ratcheted it up even further when New York's most

196
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:04.550
prominent crime writer,

197
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.910
New York Times columnist and Jimmy Breslin and received a handwritten letter

198
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:11.540
from a person claiming to be the son of Sam.
It's included the following,

199
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.720
Mr Breslin,
sir,

200
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.430
don't think that because you haven't heard from me for awhile that I went to

201
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:20.000
sleep.
No.
Rather,
I am still here like a spirit.

202
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.870
Remming the night thirsty,
hungry.
Seldom stopping to rest.

203
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.490
Anxious to please Sam.
I love my work.
Now.
The void has been filled.

204
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.270
Perhaps we shall meet face to face someday or perhaps they will be blown away by

205
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:36.100
cops.
With smoking 30 eights Breslin contacted the police.

206
00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:39.140
He noted that the letter contained the details of some of the crimes that have

207
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:40.670
not yet been released to the public.

208
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.780
They allowed the times to publish part of the latter as a companion to Breslin's

209
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:45.680
printed response,

210
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:49.310
which urged the killer to turn himself in that addition of the times,

211
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.930
so more than a million copies,

212
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.600
the NYP formed operation Omega the most comprehensive investigation in its

213
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.960
history.
In order to bring the son of Sam to justice,

214
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:04.230
over 300 detectives worked around the clock as a daily cost of $90,000 45

215
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.380
psychiatrists poured over the taunting letters that Burke of its was writing

216
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:12.310
with the general consensus being that he was a paranoid loner who was unable to

217
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:16.540
form relationships and with possible connections to devil worship on the nihs of

218
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.130
the Moscow woods,
Vln z shooting.

219
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.090
A woman named Cecilia Davis was walking her dog when she saw a police officer at

220
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:25.480
ticketing a young man in a car that was parked alongside of fire hydrants.

221
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.433
Soon thereafter,

222
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.010
she saw what appeared to be the same young man walked pasta as staring at a

223
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.340
menacingly.
It was enough to scare her into at speedy dash home.

224
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.250
After the murders,
Ms. Davis gave the information to the police.

225
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.360
As a result of this,

226
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:41.200
every driver who had been ticketed that night was brought in for questioning and

227
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:44.170
one of the people on that list was David Berkowitz,

228
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.730
a detective trying to get hold of backwards over the phone,

229
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.880
but there was no answer that just active then contacted the Yonkers police

230
00:12:55.881 --> 00:12:59.540
station to see if they could help get them in touch with Berkowitz,

231
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.500
the dispatcher,
he spoke to you.
It just happens to be the daughter of Sam car,

232
00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:04.730
David's former landlord,

233
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:08.070
and the inspiration for the son of Sam label that Burkowitz said,

234
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.160
anointed himself with the detective,

235
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:14.450
interviewed Sam Call who informed him that Berkowitz had shot his dog and was a

236
00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:15.680
pretty troubled individual.

237
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.670
The physical and psychological description that was given to seems to gel rather

238
00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:22.850
well with the profile of the son of Sam.
From this point on,

239
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:25.010
evidence against Berkowitz quickly mounted.

240
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.650
A suspected arson was reported close to his apartment,

241
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.340
but he's interviewed David's former neighbor,
Charles Gossman.

242
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.560
He showed them the nasty letters that Berkowitz had written to him.

243
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.090
On August the 10th 1977 detectives found his Ford Galaxy parked outside his

244
00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:40.850
apartment,
although they didn't have a search warrant,

245
00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:44.840
they began searching the car on the back seat was a duffle bag containing a

246
00:13:44.841 --> 00:13:45.440
rifle.

247
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.430
Inside the glove compartment was a handwritten letter addressed to the Suffolk

248
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.460
County police department that warned of a coming attack on a disco.

249
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.530
One of the officers were sent to get a search warrant.

250
00:13:54.531 --> 00:13:58.040
12 the officers stayed by the car and member of the public was stolen to park

251
00:13:58.041 --> 00:13:58.531
his car,

252
00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:01.880
so it was to box in the four to making it hard for back of heads to get away.

253
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.420
If he came out of his apartment,
a swat team was deployed around the area.

254
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.740
Finally at around 10:30 PM Berkowitz came out of his apartment and got into his

255
00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:13.070
car and detective approached and tapped on his window the sun there.

256
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:15.920
Sam then rolled down the window and said,
well,
you got me.

257
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.230
How come it took you such a long time?

258
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.810
The arrest of the son of Sam caused a worldwide sensation.

259
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.080
It turns out that the monster who would terrorize the world's most famous city

260
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:33.270
was a rather pathetic looking loser.

261
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.080
Berkowitz admitted to all of the attacks providing details that only the

262
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:38.220
perpetrator would know.

263
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.490
On August the 11th he was charged with second degree murder for the killing of

264
00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:42.600
Stacey Moskovitz.

265
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.470
The judge ordered a psychological evaluation to determine if he was fit to stand

266
00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:47.400
trial.
Meanwhile,

267
00:14:47.401 --> 00:14:51.180
the media was in a frenzy to cover every angle of the son of Sam Story.

268
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.950
This result is and the state of New York and acting what became known as the son

269
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:58.850
of Sam laws permitting the state to confiscate the proceeds from any earnings

270
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:02.690
made as proceeds of a crime for a period of five years after the act was

271
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:06.710
committed.
This money then goes to the victims of the crime.
As it turns out,

272
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.300
that was to be no trial.

273
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.900
Balco widths pled guilty to six counts of merger and refuse the edging of his

274
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:15.260
attorney to claim a defense of insanity.
He later status.

275
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.020
I just wanted to end it and I was so distraught.

276
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.670
I just confessed that guilty and got it over with and just wanted to get out of

277
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:24.890
that environment during a sentencing,

278
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.080
the mother of Stacy Moskowitz stood up and said,

279
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.860
I could kill him with my bare hands and I am not a violent person.

280
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.090
I could probably kill him and go for dinner and go to sleep that night.

281
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.130
Trudy peacefully during Mrs Moskowitz's statements,

282
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.240
Berkowitz repeated over and over that Stacy as a whole.

283
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.420
Then he burst from his seat and made for the courtroom window.

284
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.140
He was eventually restraints but not before knocking down several offices.

285
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.260
Sentencing was delayed until June the 12th 1978 on which date he was sentenced

286
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:57.800
to six consecutive life sentences.
Balco.
It's proved to be a problem prisoner.

287
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.760
He reveled in tormenting other inmates because of his rage and other inmates

288
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.430
referred to him as [inaudible].
On July the 10th,

289
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.490
1979 he was attacked by another inmate with a razor,

290
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.360
the resulting neck injuries that required 57 stitches.

291
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.840
After 10 years of confinement,
Berkowitz became a born again Christian.

292
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.860
There's angry mass kilo was converted into an evangelical passivist.

293
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.220
He absorbed himself in a letter writing campaign to spread the message of the

294
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:23.580
Bible.
Over the years,
uh,

295
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.800
following developed around Berkowitz is the ultimate example of the changed man.

296
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:32.630
The Modern Day equivalent of the Apostle Paul Berkowitz fest became eligible for

297
00:16:32.631 --> 00:16:34.730
parole in 2002,
however,

298
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.180
he sends a letter to the parole board requesting that the hearing be canceled.

299
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.490
And as he stated,
in all honesty,

300
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.940
I believe that I deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life.

301
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.530
I have with God's help long ago come to terms with my situation and I have

302
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.330
accepted my punishment.

303
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.010
He has been up for parole every two years since 2002 but he has consistently

304
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:57.890
refused the opportunity to see cause freedom as a result.

305
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.940
He remains in prison to this very day where he is considered to be a model

306
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:04.770
prisoner.
Sorry,
have you found the video?
Interesting.
If he did,

307
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.190
did give us a thumbs up below.
Let us know what you think.

308
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:09.830
If you've got a suggestion for us as well,
leave that below.

309
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:10.641
And if you see when you lie,

310
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:13.880
give it that thumbs up and it'll rise to the top and then we're more likely to

311
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:17.120
see it and make it so do that.
If you fancy,
like I say,

312
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:20.560
subscribe like all of that good stuff and I'll see you in the next video.
