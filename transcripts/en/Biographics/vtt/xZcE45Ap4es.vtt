1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Night of being photographed shirtless and alongside wild animals,</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.741
<v Speaker 1>rabbits.</v>

3
00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:04.574
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin,</v>

5
00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>he's cultivated an image as an intimidating and fearless figure on the world</v>

6
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a martial arts expert,</v>

8
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.840
<v Speaker 1>but fearless political actor and a former spy is resume holds a certain cachet</v>

9
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>in the west.</v>

10
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>As a former KGB agents,</v>

11
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>he's automatically associated with secrecy,</v>

12
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>intimidation,</v>

13
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and the old fears Americans had of the Soviet Union for much of the 21st century</v>

14
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>policing instead of himself that he lives in long time as an ordinary person,</v>

15
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>ordinary Ms. all he wishes to be for decades,</v>

16
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>though he hasn't been anything but ordinary as he spent his life climbing the</v>

17
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>ranks of the Russian government's moving farther and farther away from his</v>

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>ordinary roots.</v>

19
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>He was born in Saint Petersburg in 1957 in the midst of the Cold War.</v>

20
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>

21
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>he had two older brothers,</v>

22
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately both died during childhood,</v>

23
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.333
<v Speaker 1>so Puson,</v>

24
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>he was raised essentially as an only child.</v>

25
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>He was an atheist as a child,</v>

26
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>but today he's an eastern Orthodox Christian.</v>

27
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>During Putin's childhood,</v>

28
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>his mother stayed at home and his father,</v>

29
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>a veteran of world war two,</v>

30
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>worked in a factory as an interesting aside here,</v>

31
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:22.990
<v Speaker 1>his grandfather was a cook.</v>

32
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>He works for Vladimir Lenin and even prepared meals for stolen a few times the</v>

33
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:28.531
<v Speaker 1>pigeon family.</v>

34
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>They lived in a communal apartment shared by three families,</v>

35
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>a home where Putin says he used to hunt rats in the stairwell.</v>

36
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps a precursor to you is later fascination with hunting Manz with wild</v>

37
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.374
<v Speaker 1>animals in general.</v>

38
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.953
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

39
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

40
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Growing up,</v>

41
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>it didn't prove himself to be anything particularly special in his early years,</v>

42
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>but then by the age of 12 he discovered athletic competition.</v>

43
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.310
<v Speaker 1>It was in the midst of a competition that Putin began to set himself apart.</v>

44
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts was his chosen sport,</v>

45
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>particularly sambo and judo.</v>

46
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Though his mother did not initially approve of his participation in these sports</v>

47
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>boots and proved himself to be a worthy and skilled competitor in both.</v>

48
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>

49
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 1>his coach even showed up at the pigs and home to speak with his mother about how</v>

50
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>much promise that image showed.</v>

51
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I was actually that the did the trick and his parents began to support his</v>

53
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>athletic pursuits.</v>

54
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.910
<v Speaker 1>These in now holds a black belt in judo and just continued to compete in both</v>

55
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>sambo and judo,</v>

56
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 1>establishing himself as the first world leader to be at an advanced level in</v>

57
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>these sports.</v>

58
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>He also remains the presidents at the same Dojo he practiced in while growing up</v>

59
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 1>though he established himself as athletically talented person,</v>

60
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 1>did not excel academically in school during his challenges.</v>

61
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He attended a local school for his early years and then attended a magnet school</v>

62
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>focused on chemistry.</v>

63
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't push himself,</v>

64
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but his teacher saw that he did have potential and they encouraged him to focus</v>

65
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>as much on his school work as he did on his martial arts practice.</v>

66
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It was in the sixth grade when really began to push himself and that showed in</v>

67
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>his grades.</v>

68
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>He was welcomed to the Young Pioneers,</v>

69
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>the youth group that was run by the Communist Party.</v>

70
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>This was a serious mark of honor is pizza and had previously been one of only a</v>

71
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>few from the class who had not been welcomed into the organization now from 1970</v>

72
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>to 1975 feet in,</v>

73
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>continued his studies at some Petersburg State University.</v>

74
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>While there he studied law and was required to join the communist party.</v>

75
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>He later left the posse denouncing communism in 1991.</v>

76
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>When he said of Marxism Leninism this,</v>

77
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>it became more and more obvious for me,</v>

78
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>more obvious that it was nothing more than a beautiful and harmful fairytale in</v>

79
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg state university pten.</v>

80
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Matt's Anatoly Sobchak who would become a key figure in Putin's political</v>

81
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:43.324
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

82
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Self check was an assistant professor at the school,</v>

83
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>but he actually went on to co author the constitution of the Russian Federation</v>

84
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>and was also the first democratically elected mayor of some Peter's though.</v>

85
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.253
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

86
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Who's in graduated from Saint Petersburg State University in 1975 and it was</v>

87
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:07.580
<v Speaker 1>then that he joined the KGB.</v>

88
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 1>KGB was the Soviet Union Security Agency for much of the 20th century.</v>

89
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>It was created in 1954 and continued to operate until 1991 when the Soviet Union</v>

90
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>itself was dismantles.</v>

91
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.090
<v Speaker 1>It translated to English.</v>

92
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 1>KGB stands for state security committee.</v>

93
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It has a reputation for oppression and monitoring the actions and opinions of</v>

94
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Soviet citizens.</v>

95
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>KGB.</v>

96
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It was a truly frightening organization for democracy as an indication of the</v>

97
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>dangers of communism to Westerners,</v>

98
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>the organization rebellions and kept a close eye on anyone suspected to be an</v>

99
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.870
<v Speaker 1>opposition to the Soviet regime who didn't started his career with the KGB in</v>

100
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Leningrad boss.</v>

101
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:47.510
<v Speaker 1>He was a to move to do Dresden,</v>

102
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Germany before was transferred to Germany.</v>

103
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Putin married to this very day.</v>

104
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Putin keeps his home life are very private and information about his family is</v>

105
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 1>very closely guarded.</v>

106
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.470
<v Speaker 1>He and his wife lived.</v>

107
00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Millard were married from 1983 until the divorce in 2013,</v>

108
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>that divorce that was seemingly amicable with no specific reason given for it</v>

109
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.840
<v Speaker 1>though Lynn Miller made references to Putin's dedication to his work and the</v>

110
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>time investment required to serve as a world leader.</v>

111
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.620
<v Speaker 1>They have two daughters together,</v>

112
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Maria and tax arena,</v>

113
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>both of whose lives remain incredibly secrets.</v>

114
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.960
<v Speaker 1>They both used fake names to go and register for college and it's not entirely</v>

115
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:25.820
<v Speaker 1>known in which country either of the daughters currently lives in 2016 European</v>

116
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:30.140
<v Speaker 1>newspapers even described and Maria as a secret daughter noticing if she had not</v>

117
00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:33.830
<v Speaker 1>been willing to be photographed during the entire length of Putin's time and</v>

118
00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 1>power for a former spy and they man with many,</v>

119
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:37.311
<v Speaker 1>many enemies.</v>

120
00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:41.630
<v Speaker 1>It's sensible that his daughters have maintains this secret life who didn't</v>

121
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:45.560
<v Speaker 1>indeed a status either private life in which I do not permit interference.</v>

122
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It must be respected,</v>

123
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.020
<v Speaker 1>so pretend he moved with his family to</v>

124
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.780
<v Speaker 3>Dresden where he served with the KGB for five years.</v>

125
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.290
<v Speaker 3>He was fluent in German and still speaks this language to this day.</v>

126
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Auntie stated that he actually feels more comfortable using German than English.</v>

127
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Putin served in this dresden posts from 1985 to 1990,</v>

128
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.640
<v Speaker 3>working as an undercover agents playing the part of a translator.</v>

129
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.180
<v Speaker 3>The work,</v>

130
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.280
<v Speaker 3>though not all of our peers in the dead is known.</v>

131
00:06:17.281 --> 00:06:18.450
<v Speaker 3>It was the spy after all,</v>

132
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.310
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't particularly interesting.</v>

133
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Much of it was simply amassing information on people,</v>

134
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.020
<v Speaker 3>ensuring that they remain loyal to the Soviet.</v>

135
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Some we're not passing any kind of revolution.</v>

136
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.410
<v Speaker 3>In 1999,</v>

137
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:31.950
<v Speaker 3>though the situation it became rather than more dicey for Soviet see were</v>

138
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:35.580
<v Speaker 3>stationed in Dresden during one incident as it became more and more clear that</v>

139
00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:35.961
<v Speaker 3>he's German,</v>

140
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.830
<v Speaker 3>he was falling out of Soviet control.</v>

141
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Putin and his colleagues feared for their lives as crowds stormed the KGB</v>

142
00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:43.410
<v Speaker 3>headquarters in Dresden.</v>

143
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Booty calls in the Soviet military for how the birds.</v>

144
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.260
<v Speaker 3>He was told that nothing could be done for them and less Moscow gave the order</v>

145
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.090
<v Speaker 3>something that Moscow never did.</v>

146
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.380
<v Speaker 3>While Putin and his colleagues well,</v>

147
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.310
<v Speaker 3>they survived that day,</v>

148
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 3>it has become increasingly clear that the situation was unstable during this</v>

149
00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

150
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Putin ends of the KGB.</v>

151
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Agents began burning files so that when the day came that their headquarters was</v>

152
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:05.670
<v Speaker 3>either taken or abandons or both,</v>

153
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 3>no files would be left in the hands of the enemy.</v>

154
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>The Berlin Wall fell in November of 1989 and soon after Peyton and his family,</v>

155
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>they returned to Russia by this point piece in held.</v>

156
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 1>The rank of lieutenant colonel indicates beat,</v>

157
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>however the KGB was nearing the end of its existence and Putin was able to find</v>

158
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:32.650
<v Speaker 1>work at the State University of some pieces.</v>

159
00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Doug.</v>

160
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.780
<v Speaker 1>He was no ordinary professor.</v>

161
00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:35.080
<v Speaker 1>They ate.</v>

162
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.000
<v Speaker 1>He was still working for the KGB,</v>

163
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.810
<v Speaker 1>part of his job included keeping an eye out for students who showed promise as</v>

164
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>potential new kgb recruits through his job,</v>

165
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but he was also able to reconnect with his former professor and Natalie.</v>

166
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:48.964
<v Speaker 1>Subject.</v>

167
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Subject,</v>

168
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 1>he was elected the mayor of Pittsburgh in 1991 and Putin joined his team as an</v>

169
00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:54.790
<v Speaker 1>advisor.</v>

170
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.680
<v Speaker 1>He works for subject until 1996 when subject last reelection losing could've</v>

171
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:01.930
<v Speaker 1>opted to continue working for his successor,</v>

172
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>but Putin believes that taking a job with subjects political opponents would be</v>

173
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:06.371
<v Speaker 1>disloyal.</v>

174
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:06.761
<v Speaker 1>Anti.</v>

175
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Instead chose to move to Moscow to begin working with the Yeltsin administrator.</v>

176
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>During Boris Yeltsin presidency,</v>

177
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>pten rose through the ranks first serving as deputy chief administrative or the</v>

178
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Kremlin.</v>

179
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Russia is fashion of the White House in 1999,</v>

180
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>he was named secretary of the Security Council and became Yeltsin's chief</v>

181
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:35.240
<v Speaker 1>advisor on matters of foreign relations and intelligence,</v>

182
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but it was then the Putin's Korea got a real real boost.</v>

183
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeltsin decided he didn't want to keep his current prime minister,</v>

184
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>so he got rid of him.</v>

185
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 1>That was in August of 1999 and oh,</v>

186
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.030
<v Speaker 1>he was the beneficiary of this decision as the eldest son named Vladimir Putin</v>

187
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and do the post Yeltsin offered Putin the position of a prime minister with</v>

188
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>prospects somewhat foreshadowing the next step in Putin's Korea because it was</v>

189
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 1>only months after naming buton is prime minister Boris Yeltsin himself.</v>

190
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Steps down and Vladimir Putin became the acting president of Russia and that was</v>

191
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>in December of 1999.</v>

192
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Then three months later,</v>

193
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.980
<v Speaker 1>in March of 2015,</v>

194
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>he was officially elected and became president of Russia in his own</v>

195
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.703
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

196
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.580
<v Speaker 1>10 opponents run against him for president,</v>

197
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but he won nationals for the first time in Russia's history.</v>

198
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.810
<v Speaker 1>There was a peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected presidents</v>

199
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>who didn't.</v>

200
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>He used his first time to advocate for certain international policies including</v>

201
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:41.630
<v Speaker 1>approval of the start,</v>

202
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:46.610
<v Speaker 1>two arms treaty and improving relations with China was also initially supportive</v>

203
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>of the United States,</v>

204
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>his war on terror that fully the nine slash 11 terrorist attacks,</v>

205
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.520
<v Speaker 1>but he did not support the United States.</v>

206
00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:57.521
<v Speaker 1>This invasion of Iraq during Putin's first summer in power tragedy struck Russia</v>

207
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 1>when the cask submarine sank in the barren sea in August.</v>

208
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Please didn't.</v>

209
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.850
<v Speaker 1>He was on vacation when the sinking your courage and he did not immediately</v>

210
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:09.470
<v Speaker 1>returned home to address the sinking and the deaths of all 118 crew members who</v>

211
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.340
<v Speaker 1>had been on board.</v>

212
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Then when he was asked what went wrong with the cask,</v>

213
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 1>Putin replied starkly that it sank destroyers and angry Russians were attacking</v>

214
00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:21.800
<v Speaker 1>the president for his handling or like they're all over the cask disaster with</v>

215
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>some even accusing him of leaving sailors to die when a rescue might've still</v>

216
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:26.060
<v Speaker 1>been possible.</v>

217
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 1>That despite all of this opinion,</v>

218
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:30.680
<v Speaker 1>polls showed that overall his image did not sustain much damage from the</v>

219
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>

220
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

221
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.630
<v Speaker 1>four years later,</v>

222
00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the cask tragedy did not affect his reelection.</v>

223
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>At all in 2004,</v>

224
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the Russians reelected him to a second term as president,</v>

225
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and they were apparently really pleased with the job.</v>

226
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>He was doing his speech and received over 70 percent of the volume</v>

227
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.980
<v Speaker 1>during his first term in office who's head focused on economic reform,</v>

228
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>having denounced communism.</v>

229
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>He instead supported an economic system that was essentially capitalism with</v>

230
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>very strict regulations and oversight.</v>

231
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 1>After years of economic struggle,</v>

232
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Russia was finally beginning to see a stabilizing and even growing economy under</v>

233
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Putin.</v>

234
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Some reports,</v>

235
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 1>but Russia's grief during his first term at seven percent annually.</v>

236
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

237
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>he still remembered favorably for this growth,</v>

238
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 1>though it came with increased nationalization of industry and in part because of</v>

239
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.111
<v Speaker 1>the mid two thousands,</v>

240
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:26.340
<v Speaker 1>global financial crash,</v>

241
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>the grief did not last,</v>

242
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.531
<v Speaker 1>but in the country.</v>

243
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:32.070
<v Speaker 1>He's economy was in disarray for nearly the entire decade before pten.</v>

244
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 1>His rise to power and area of growth in which disposable income nearly doubles</v>

245
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.330
<v Speaker 1>was reason for the people to think really positively of Pearson.</v>

246
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Now Pearson did work on those economic policies we already mentioned is fast</v>

247
00:11:42.371 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

248
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but he also made strides in foreign relations including making a historic trip</v>

249
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 1>to Israel.</v>

250
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>This was the first ever trip by a Russian leader to the country.</v>

251
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Conversations between Putin and Israeli,</v>

252
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>focused largely on security issues.</v>

253
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 1>The tread gotten as much attention to around the world as it came in the midst</v>

254
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>of strengthening ties between Russia and Israel.</v>

255
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Though the two nations disagreed on topics such as the Russian side of missiles</v>

256
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:06.994
<v Speaker 1>to Syria,</v>

257
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.090
<v Speaker 1>the trip was also seen as a move by Putin to help secure Russia's position as a</v>

258
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 1>key diplomatic actor in any Middle East peace discussions or agreements.</v>

259
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

260
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.250
<v Speaker 1>security issues were present not just abroad,</v>

261
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>though then homeland security would become a major focus for Putin.</v>

262
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

263
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>this is something that became really clear during the horrific tragedy of the</v>

264
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Beslan school.</v>

265
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 in September,</v>

266
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>terrorists held over 1000 people hostage at the Beslan school in North Asitia.</v>

267
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Nearly 800 of these hostages.</v>

268
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>They were children for three days.</v>

269
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.570
<v Speaker 1>These terrorists demolishing Chechen,</v>

270
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>an independence from Russia helped these people hostage situation had a tragic</v>

271
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 1>ending when tanks,</v>

272
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:45.251
<v Speaker 1>rockets,</v>

273
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>and other artillery we used by the Russian military to try to clear the school.</v>

274
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Special Forces entered the school after hearing explosions from inside were the</v>

275
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>hostages were being caps,</v>

276
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>but their actions,</v>

277
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they did not save lives.</v>

278
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary in the siege of the school ever.</v>

279
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>300 people died,</v>

280
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 1>nearly two thirds of whom were children the tragedy.</v>

281
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It shook the world,</v>

282
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 1>and while the government's was cleared of any wrongdoing,</v>

283
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>

284
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 1>the European Court of human rights later stated that Russia had used excessive</v>

285
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:11.650
<v Speaker 1>force and lacked caution,</v>

286
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and they storm into the school just bawling his anger and discontentment that</v>

287
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the government's handling of the tragedy in general,</v>

288
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 1>it did not affect the public's view of pewter and very much at all,</v>

289
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.291
<v Speaker 1>quite the opposite.</v>

290
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

291
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>a poll taken off to the best of a masochist stated that 83 percent of Russians</v>

292
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>were still happy with him.</v>

293
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 1>The vessel and tragedy did lead to changes in the halls of Russian power,</v>

294
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 1>though primarily giving more power to the Russian president.</v>

295
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.781
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

296
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>instead of electing governors in regions like north Asitia in Chechnya,</v>

297
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.150
<v Speaker 1>the presidents would have the power to appoint governance in 2007,</v>

298
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 1>and during his second term,</v>

299
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Putin was named Time Magazine's person of the year.</v>

300
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>The magazine called the final year of his second term is most successful yet,</v>

301
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's the cover photo for the issue,</v>

302
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>a portrait of Putin,</v>

303
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.510
<v Speaker 1>one the photographer,</v>

304
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 1>the world press photo award.</v>

305
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>During the shoot that you've discussed them,</v>

306
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.030
<v Speaker 1>mutual admiration for the Beatles.</v>

307
00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>This connection helped you tend to become more comfortable and it's for the</v>

308
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>photographer,</v>

309
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.600
<v Speaker 1>the chance to get an award winning shot of the intimidating world leader.</v>

310
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>No matter how popular Putin was,</v>

311
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 1>though that Russian people could not elect him to a third time the Russian</v>

312
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>constitution simply for credit.</v>

313
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

314
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>pieces and found a way around this role just when his time in office was about</v>

315
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:15.920
<v Speaker 1>to years</v>

316
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.753
<v Speaker 3>run out.</v>

317
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Presidential terms in Russia had been extended to six years,</v>

318
00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but this change did not benefit Putin.</v>

319
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.650
<v Speaker 1>He was beholding to the previous constitutional rules.</v>

320
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.800
<v Speaker 1>So how is it you got to stay in power while the man who was elected,</v>

321
00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Russia's next presidents was Dimitri Medvedev,</v>

322
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and he was a protege of Putin's and benefited from Putin's rise to power.</v>

323
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Neither he nor I wanted Putin's it'd be pushed off the international stage and</v>

324
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>so medvedev unnamed Putin as Russia's prime minister,</v>

325
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>a position he had previously held under Boris Yeltsin after 13 years in</v>

326
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>leadership at present would remain as the highest levels of Russia's</v>

327
00:14:59.421 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

328
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 1>He and his supporters were able to keep them in power and stay in line with the</v>

329
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:04.230
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

330
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>although not exactly in line with its exact intent.</v>

331
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>During his third time as prime minister from 2008 to 2012,</v>

332
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Putin focused on dealing with the economic crisis that swept the wells as well</v>

333
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>as Russia's population problems.</v>

334
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Russia is population was falling by 1 million people a year,</v>

335
00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>a devastating number for a country whose population is only $150 million in</v>

336
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>2010.</v>

337
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.150
<v Speaker 1>The trend is reversed and Russia's population began to grow.</v>

338
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>The reversal is empowered credited to Putin's economic reforms.</v>

339
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.400
<v Speaker 1>When people have more money,</v>

340
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 1>it is easier to support a larger family.</v>

341
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 1>One of Putin's economic reforms include in joining the World Trade Organization</v>

342
00:15:41.061 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 1>or WTO in 2012 negotiations for rushing to join.</v>

343
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>The WTO lasted nearly two decades as they had started.</v>

344
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 1>After the fall of the Soviet Union,</v>

345
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Russia was granted entry into the WTO.</v>

346
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Often negotiations reached a point in which granted Russia permission to phase</v>

347
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 1>in the opening of markets.</v>

348
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Wireless aligns with other WTO trading requirements.</v>

349
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Now all his political party retains dominance and Putin was again the candidate</v>

350
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.410
<v Speaker 1>for president in 2012.</v>

351
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.310
<v Speaker 1>He did not escape politically unscathed from his maneuver to hold onto power</v>

352
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 1>buying.</v>

353
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Sidestepping the term limits the elections in 2012 for that heavily protested</v>

354
00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:23.830
<v Speaker 1>with claims of fraud tainting Putin's election to a third time.</v>

355
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.241
<v Speaker 1>The task,</v>

356
00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:26.680
<v Speaker 1>if the government is not only to pour honey into a cup,</v>

357
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes do you give it a medicine bottle display?</v>

358
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:30.911
<v Speaker 1>Those protests?</v>

359
00:16:30.911 --> 00:16:31.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

360
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>he was inaugurated in May of 2012,</v>

361
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and this time his term would be six years.</v>

362
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.900
<v Speaker 1>This means that Putin will be president of Russia until at least 2018 and with</v>

363
00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:44.830
<v Speaker 1>allegations of his interference in the United States elections is prominence in</v>

364
00:16:44.831 --> 00:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

365
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 1>My only turn you seems to road</v>

366
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 1>wheaton has continued to be reelected,</v>

367
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 1>reappointed to positions at the highest level of Russian government's his time</v>

368
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:00.411
<v Speaker 1>in office.</v>

369
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not been without questions surrounding his shady actions.</v>

370
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Among the high points or low points we should say,</v>

371
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.250
<v Speaker 1>of intrigue surrounding Poussin.</v>

372
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>All the murders of Russian journalists,</v>

373
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that's of generalists were any points of concern in Russia.</v>

374
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Longed for Putin's rise to power,</v>

375
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but the issue well,</v>

376
00:17:16.141 --> 00:17:20.330
<v Speaker 1>it began to get a lot of international attention during Putin's second time as</v>

377
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.680
<v Speaker 1>presidents when journalists,</v>

378
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>a political sky was murdered.</v>

379
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 1>This journalist had been a strong critic of Putin and particularly the war in</v>

380
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Chechnya.</v>

381
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Even before her death,</v>

382
00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:32.100
<v Speaker 1>she was even poisoned but ultimately recovered her mother.</v>

383
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It remains to this day on solved,</v>

384
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.110
<v Speaker 1>but there is suspicion that Putin and his governance,</v>

385
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.990
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they targeted taught well.</v>

386
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

387
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Sky is also far from the only Putin opponents.</v>

388
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 1>His death has occurred in suspicious circumstances in March of 2017.</v>

389
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:49.901
<v Speaker 1>The Washington Post even published a list of 10 such deaths among deaths was a</v>

390
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 1>former deputy prime minister and Putin critic who was shot outside the Kremlin.</v>

391
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>He was a tycoon and his death was initially called a suicide,</v>

392
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>but now that's rather unsure is also a generalist who was kidnapped and shot in</v>

393
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>the woods and the former KGB agent.</v>

394
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>He was found to be poisoned by Russian agents.</v>

395
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the generalist who died of a mysterious illness and he's medical</v>

396
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 1>records have been sealed.</v>

397
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Sajan not failing on any intriguing.</v>

398
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

399
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I get many of these deaths may never be proven beyond doubt to be the work of</v>

400
00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Putin's government.</v>

401
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:30.010
<v Speaker 1>One thing is absolutely certain Vladimir Putin does not like to be viewed as</v>

402
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:31.010
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>

403
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.910
<v Speaker 1>He has done all he can to prevent strength and show the world that he is strong</v>

404
00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and manly.</v>

405
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Beyond is active participation in martial arts.</v>

406
00:18:38.091 --> 00:18:40.190
<v Speaker 1>He shows his power and dominance by hunting,</v>

407
00:18:40.191 --> 00:18:40.671
<v Speaker 1>tracking,</v>

408
00:18:40.671 --> 00:18:42.470
<v Speaker 1>and closing with wild animals.</v>

409
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.060
<v Speaker 1>He's caught a huge fish including a 46 pounds pike and shot a crossbow.</v>

410
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:47.930
<v Speaker 1>At a whale,</v>

411
00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>normally to tranquilize it though,</v>

412
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you also want to save to camera crew from a Siberian tiger that was about to</v>

413
00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:55.880
<v Speaker 1>attack them while on a tour of a wildlife sanctuary.</v>

414
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

415
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Speaker 1>he's actually got close enough to hold a bas.</v>

416
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.730
