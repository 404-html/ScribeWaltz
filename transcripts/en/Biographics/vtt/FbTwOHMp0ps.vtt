Sero watches,

2
00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:06.130
luxury handcrafted watches at fair prices.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.870
You can check them out@vincesarahwatches.com forward slash biographics and link

4
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:11.980
in the description below.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.930
It's the sad fact that evil men are often as well remembered as history's good

6
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.120
guys.
For every Abraham Lincoln or Gandy,
there are,

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.730
it doesn't Hitler's or Stalin's or dom has all Bundys or while you got the idea,

8
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:28.450
we've covered them a lot here.
A biographics tragic as it is to admit,

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.310
one of the most sure fire ways of being remembered is to make life a misery for

10
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:34.450
millions of people.

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.480
But what if we told you that was a man responsible for the deaths of tens or

12
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.400
hundreds of thousands of people who you've never heard of?

13
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.240
A serial killer who committed massacres,
rapes with impunity,
and to help us,

14
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:50.980
one of the worst dictators in history carry out his heinous crimes.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.740
While not only did this man unfortunately exist,

16
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:58.741
he only died in 1953 his name was Lorenzi barrier stolons architect of terror.

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.740
The Fed had of Stalin's and KVD barrier was direct and you're responsible for

18
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:07.870
some of the USSR as worst crimes.

19
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.400
He took charge of an ethnic cleansing in the Soviet Union.
After World War II,

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.230
he rapes dozens of women murdered with his own bare hands and once sent over

21
00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:22.231
22,000 people to their deaths with a single swipe of his pen.

22
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.621
In the video today,

23
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:27.130
we're looking at the gruesome story of the man whose name once made off of

24
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:27.850
Europe,

25
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.320
tremble in fear and how he came to vanish from the history books.

26
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.560
They say that monsters are not born,
they're made.
It's a comforting thought,

27
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:52.890
but it's difficult to square with what we know of this man.

28
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.970
When he was born in Georgia in 1899 it wasn't exactly into circumstances.

29
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.430
That screen this kid is going to be a massive minute era.

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.250
Young [inaudible] life was boringly normal.

31
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.300
His father was a poor farmer and his mother was a faded Nobel stock.

32
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.660
While his father would disappear from his life when Lorenzi was young,

33
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.110
runaway fathers don't normally create killers.
If they did,

34
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.800
Charlie Chaplin would be famous today.
Not for slaying them,
we've loved her,

35
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.140
but for literally slaying them.
However,

36
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.760
there was one other fatherless Georgian who grew up to be a mascara like

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.360
Lindsay.

38
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.010
He was born into rural Georgia to a poor family in the late 19th century like

39
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.970
Lindsey has father dropped out of his life at a tender age.

40
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.020
His name was Joseph Stalin.

41
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.430
Not that the two men knew each other in Georgia or anything is narratively

42
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:43.431
pleasing as that Stalin was over 20 when Lindsey was born in 1916 as the

43
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:48.000
communists from head to detonate a revolutionary bomb that would shake the

44
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.590
world's love.
Renzi was a simple nobody studying engineering and barker,

45
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.360
which is modern day as a genre.

46
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.050
It wasn't until the upheaval of 1917 February revolution.

47
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.520
That barrier even joins the communist party,

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.530
but to I'm joining of the Communist Party.
Well,

49
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.230
it would turn out to be a heck of a career move.

50
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.720
Barely was the ink dry on barriers,

51
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.220
membership costs than the tsunami of the October Revolution came a crashing over

52
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.780
Europe.
One of the single most significant events of the 20th century.

53
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.710
The October Revolution saw the Bolsheviks seized control of Russia,

54
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.660
bring Lennon back from exile and begin the entire process that would soon lead

55
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.020
to the Soviet Union for barrier.

56
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.240
This was a right place at the right time sort of deal.

57
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.350
The new communist recruit got enthusiastically involved in counter intelligence

58
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.140
in Pacu quickly becoming a useful agents.

59
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.690
He was there when the Russian civil war that exploded after the Bolshevik,

60
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:45.610
who swept into Azerbaijan in 1920 and in the chaos,

61
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.780
he was accidentally arrested as a counter revolutionary by the Red Army and he

62
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:50.601
was always sex accuse.

63
00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:55.150
It only a timely intervention by the Azeri communist leaders saved him perhaps

64
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.570
the wanting to make sure he never wound up in such a precarious position again.

65
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.500
Barrier quickly moved to formalize his position as a Bolshevik counter

66
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.900
intelligence agents.
So he joined the checker.

67
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.050
At the time the checker was in the midst of the red terror series of massacres.

68
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:12.100
Same just anyone who didn't support a Lennon's dictatorship.

69
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.250
Somewhere between 28 and 200,000 died and number compounded by the simultaneous

70
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:19.744
white terror,

71
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.750
which targeted those who did support Lennon and kills up to another at 100,000

72
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.910
for agents barrier.
Now back in his native Georgia,

73
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.940
this was a fight to the death.
Well,
the,

74
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:33.250
the wise tell me had much of a presence in Georgia.

75
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.990
The real problem there was Georgia nationalists in the chaotic aftermath of the

76
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:38.621
revolution.

77
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:43.621
Georgia had declared independence from Moscow briefly in 1921 the Soviets sense

78
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.490
of the tanks in and well,
that was the end of that.
I believe it was for the army.

79
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.820
The men like barrier.
This was the exact time they would need it.

80
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:55.900
The most in the first few years of Soviet rule barrier helps set up a spy

81
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:59.260
network that's infiltrated and smashed to gangs of nationalists,

82
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:04.120
dragging that members offer execution or a long ride to signed areas.

83
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:08.920
Distant gulags promoted to deputy chairman of the Georgia and checker barrier

84
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:13.921
was key to crushing the failed and nationalist revolution of 1920 for a small

85
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.340
number of historians.

86
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.690
Even think barrier orchestrated the uprising himself to justify a violent

87
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:23.260
crackdown.
Whatever the truth here,
the checkout revolution,

88
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.970
it was brutal barrier cut a deal with captured revolt leaders to make supporters

89
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.140
lay down their arms.

90
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:33.670
Then proceeded to massacre everyone who had surrendered estimate some sketchy,

91
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:37.900
but as many as 10,000 Georgians never been executed on the orders of barrier.

92
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.800
Whole villages were wiped out in one grease in episode Checker,

93
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:43.150
operatives went into a town,

94
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.770
rounded up anyone with a satin sunning and guns them all down,
including women,

95
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.820
children,
and even babies not loan officer.

96
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.060
Barrier was out to a communist party conference flush with his recent bloody

97
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:59.150
success.
He was introduced to a fellow Jorgen Joseph Stalin.

98
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.500
Then still three years away from becoming undisputed leader of the USSR was

99
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.130
apparently impressed with what he saw because he had barrier.

100
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.780
They hit it off big time.

101
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.000
It would be the start of one of the bloodiest partnerships in modern history.

102
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.950
The next few years of areas,
life can be divided into two distinct categories.

103
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.210
Consolidating his power base in Georgia and furiously Brown nosing,

104
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.290
stolen like eight sentience suppository,
the butcher of Georgia.

105
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.030
Slowly it slithered his way up the greasy pole of power dispatching enemies
here,

106
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:43.031
sending innocence off to the Gulag there and other such things as his brutality

107
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:47.780
group.
So did his snapchat barrier rose to party chairman of Georgia where he

108
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:52.360
instituted a personality culture rounds himself that was based on Stalin's.

109
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.700
This was a remarkably difficult act to pull off.

110
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.880
Well limitation might be the sincerest form of flattery.

111
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.900
Anyone in the Soviet system who built a power base struck rival styling,

112
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.850
tended to do wind up with a terminal case of death and might've helped you that

113
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.301
barrier.

114
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:13.301
It was a magnificent suck up every time he saw style and he showered him with

115
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.820
praise,
he's your guy voted the dictators vacation security detail,

116
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:21.821
even built a holiday home next to style in his villa in a near identical style,

117
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.610
but of course smaller.
If there was one thing barrier knew,
well,

118
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.490
it was how to appeal to Stalin's vanity.

119
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.630
By 1934 barrier was one of Stalin's cheerleaders on the parties,

120
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.650
all important central committee and one of the Walrus mustache leaders

121
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:37.484
confidence.

122
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.850
He had been promoted to chairman of the entire Trans Caucasian region,

123
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.900
which is Modern Day Georgia as a bit John and Armenia for an average kid from

124
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:45.621
new as well.

125
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:49.610
This was probably higher than it ever expected to rise in his wildest dreams,

126
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.850
but barrier was nothing if not ambitious.

127
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.670
In 1935 he finally made his move,

128
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:59.900
the move that would take him out of the sticks and into Moscow's corridors of

129
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.500
power.
He wrote a book,
a book,

130
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.400
various ghost dressing on the history of the Bolshevik organizations and trends.

131
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.580
Caucasian was spectacularly doe.

132
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.360
Unless you happen to be at one of the major stars of its historical narrative,

133
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.010
get to guess who might,
oh,
fill those boots.
It's absolutely right.
Of course,

134
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:22.610
it was Starlin areas.
Book was essentially a puff piece,

135
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:26.210
kind of like reading a forming article in Vanity Fair,

136
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.740
but with much more bloodshed.
Unsurprisingly,
Stalin loved it.

137
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.180
The book's publication cemented barrier and his list of personal favorites.

138
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.190
In a few short years,
it would be the catalyst for barriers.
Next big promotion,

139
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.460
but first we have to deal with the great terror.

140
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.620
If the red terror was the warmup act,

141
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.770
the great terror also known as the Great Paj was the headliners taking to the

142
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:51.651
main stage.

143
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:56.651
While fireworks exploded and the crowds screams with paralyzing fear.

144
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.044
In this case,

145
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.060
all she did in 1934 following the assassination of Sergei care of it began as a

146
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:07.110
clearing of the communist party's ranks before ballooning into a general

147
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.680
cleansing of the entire USSR.

148
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.440
Random quotas were distributed in republics like trans,

149
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:18.000
Caucasian or ensuring anyone could be snatched off the streets and executed at

150
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.920
any time.
Scientists,
artists,
soldiers,
peasants,

151
00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:24.510
foreign is ethnic minorities and more all wiped out.

152
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.500
Children of dissidents were shot for the crimes of their parents.
Today,

153
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.590
it's thought that a bare minimum of 750,000 people died with some estimating.

154
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:36.720
The figure is twice as high as that.

155
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.930
The architect of all this terror was a man known as Nikolai Yesh of the head of

156
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:46.200
the end KVD which had eventually succeed at the checkout,

157
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.800
but he [inaudible] he didn't work in a vacuum and the local republics of the

158
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:54.600
USSR and then like barrier enthusiastically followed his lead under barriers

159
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:57.660
watch.
Trans Caucasian became a sea of blood.

160
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.870
He used the purge to have old political opponents murdered,

161
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.730
tried to wipe out to minorities and settled Petty's scores with bullets.

162
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.060
It was a crazy horrifying time and anyone could have been next and barrier.

163
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.930
He very nearly was by 1938 years of was in a killing frenzy.

164
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.220
A friend of barriers in Moscow sent him an urgent message saying the n Kvd had

165
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.720
added him to the list of targets.
Terrified barrier did the only thing he could.

166
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.770
He caught a plane to Moscow and begged stolen for his life.

167
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.340
Various survival was not a foregone conclusion though.

168
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:36.810
For a couple of years Stalin had been hinting that he was getting bored with his

169
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:37.710
fellow Jorgen.

170
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.630
He no longer vacations near barrier ans while he had loved barriers book it also

171
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:47.160
not in through the disillusion of Trans Caucasian are taking barrier from head

172
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.240
Honcho of three nations to just Georgia realistically.
Very.

173
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:55.110
It probably had a 50 50 chance of stepping off the plane and somebody getting

174
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:55.944
shot.

175
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.700
Luckily it barrier landed in Moscow just to style and completely fell out with

176
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.370
yourself after indulging barriers.
Whimpered please.

177
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:05.280
For Awhile Stalin essentially said to barrier,
you know what's,

178
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:10.281
how about you take over as deputy heads of the end Kvd Alonsa only to yes off

179
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.641
and the,

180
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:15.570
and frankly only one of those guys counts because in a couple of months you're

181
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:17.880
going to have the other one to execute it.
Go on it.

182
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:23.030
And this is how barrier went in a handful of weeks from marked for death to head

183
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:24.640
of the end.
Gave Ed.
Yeah.

184
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.920
Itself was purged and barrier was placed in charge of ending the great terror.

185
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.840
Yup.
Ending it barrier may have been blood thirsty,
but he was not stupid.

186
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.800
Stalin wanted the terror to wind down so wind down it did.

187
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.700
Barea officially ended the purchase.
The execution's,
the exiles,

188
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:42.534
all of that stuff.

189
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.160
He released some prisoners and eliminated the use of purely sadistic torture in

190
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.250
the gulags.
If that seems a little off key,

191
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.160
think of barrier kind of like out of Eichmann.

192
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.040
The had absolutely no problem with unimaginable cruelty,

193
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.600
but what he hated more inefficiency and if you want to learn more about the

194
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:05.380
monster that was Eichmann,
please do check out our buyer graphics video on that.

195
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.920
I'll link to it in the description below and when it comes to a god torturing a

196
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:10.900
random prisoner just to get his kicks,

197
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.890
well that was a god who could have been torturing a known dissidence to extract

198
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:15.700
information.

199
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.020
It was simply wasted calories barrier ends in 1938 in a good place.

200
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:24.130
He had survived a purge that it wipes out a third of the entire communist party

201
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.450
had been elevated to head of the end KVD the most feared organization in the

202
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:33.400
whole of the Ussr and did done all of this while retaining his weird personality

203
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:36.230
holes in Georgia.
He also had Stalin's fever,

204
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.210
something that was no small deal when falling out with stolen men's being drags,

205
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:43.680
lock yourself into a freezing Moscow courtyard and shot.

206
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.370
So what does a man like barrier do when handed the power of life and death over

207
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.900
the whole of the USSR plus say get out of jail free card signed by stolen by the

208
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:57.330
way.
Well unfortunately for the rest of his countrymen,
we're about to find out,

209
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.440
cotton is a tiny community in the far west of Russia near the Ballah Russian

210
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.240
border in May,

211
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.240
1940 the Red Army slaughtered 22,000 Polish pow is there and dumped them in a

212
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:19.720
mass grave known today as the catty and massacre.
It was one of barriers,

213
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:23.770
most infamous actions as the head of the end Kvd oh and believe me,

214
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:27.010
the where other contenders barrier helped organize and carry out the

215
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.570
assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940 he purged the Red Army in

216
00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:32.470
the middle of World War Two.

217
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.250
You sending high ranking generals off to the Gulag in the dying days of the war.

218
00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:41.251
He oversaw a mass scale ethnic cleansing program against minorities in the U S I

219
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:46.080
saw the most infamous of these was the deportation of the Crimean Tatars,

220
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.790
which killed up to 8,000 people.
There's,

221
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:53.140
it happens and another 20 to 30,000 when they arrived at the destination.

222
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.250
All this carnage and a barrier,
the nickname the Soviet hemlock,

223
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.330
but it's barriers,

224
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.690
unofficial actions that it uneasily today and his spare hours away from the end.

225
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:07.690
KVD and supervising the Soviet atomic bomb project barrier has a gruesome hobby

226
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.320
that he pursued with psychopathic diligence.

227
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.060
This hobby was being Moscow's rapist in chief after dark.

228
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.360
A barrier would be driven around Moscow until he saw a pretty girl.

229
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.140
His goons would then kidnap outruns,

230
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.690
bring out a barriers managing in the suburbs.
There area would wine and dine.

231
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:30.090
The unfortunate wench taker to a spare bedroom and rape are girls who've

232
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.160
suffered at his hand would be handed a bouquet of flowers the next morning as

233
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:36.790
they left the house.
Taking eds would mean the sex had been consensual.

234
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.090
Refusing it.
Well,
there are conflicting stories.

235
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.610
Most accounts suggest to girl who refused barriers.

236
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:45.070
Gift could see how families sent to the Gulag,

237
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.560
but there are other even darker possibilities.
In the 1990s the tuners,

238
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.940
he an embassy moved into old mansion while doing work.

239
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:56.780
They found the bones of dozens of teenage girls buried in the garden.

240
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.910
It seems barriers,
deviant appetites,
they did not stop with rape barriers.

241
00:15:01.911 --> 00:15:06.160
Predilections where an open secret amongst the USSR sauce higher ups,

242
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.130
Stalin himself once told his own daughter to never accept a ride from barrier.

243
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.830
Nikita Khrushchev himself,
no stranger to murder,

244
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.270
openly both feared and loathed the head of the end.
KVD Yes,

245
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.730
barriers star kept rising and rising,

246
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.910
but some have even suggested barrier was the clear choice for the next head of

247
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:27.470
the Soviet Union in the event of Stalin's death.
So now you might be wondering,

248
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.830
well why didn't that happen?
Well,
in order to answer that question,

249
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.630
we need to skip ahead to 1953 to the death of Joseph Stalin

250
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.320
on the 1st of March,
1953 stolen was discovered on the floor of his share,

251
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:50.660
barely conscious and on the brink of death heavily for all those who believe in

252
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:50.991
Karma.

253
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:55.960
He spent the next five days and miserable agony before finally passing away in

254
00:15:55.961 --> 00:16:00.350
his memoirs and Nikita Khrushchev wrote various spends those five days weeping

255
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:01.011
and kissing.

256
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:05.810
Stalin's hands when it looked like the dictator would recover and grinning like

257
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:08.660
a schoolboy.
When it's an oak,
it's like he was going to die.

258
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.080
Walker's chef isn't the most reliable witness to anything to do with his old

259
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:15.390
enemy barrier.
He may be right on the money here.
It doesn't worry me.

260
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.930
The barrier was falling out of style in his favor.

261
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:22.931
In 1953 Barea has long been suspected of secretly poisoning the dictator to save

262
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:26.120
his own skin.
Although no firm evidence has ever emerged,

263
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.020
weather barrier did the deed or merely benefited from it.

264
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.710
There's no doubting that Stalin's death find something in is with an old heart.

265
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.400
As an ethic power struggle erupted between Khrushchev and Malin called for the

266
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.310
now vacated throne barrier.

267
00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.290
I've got the drop on them by doing something unexpected.

268
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.370
He transformed into a statesman in any ways.

269
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.740
The last hundred days of barriers life are the most fascinating.

270
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.920
History today remembers Khrushchev's secret speech denouncing style and in 1956

271
00:16:54.111 --> 00:16:58.970
three years off to the Munster died barrier was denouncing stolen within three

272
00:16:58.971 --> 00:16:59.630
weeks.

273
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.200
One of his first acts was to play the party's central committee secret tapes

274
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:07.250
that had recorded his conversations with style and to convince them as former

275
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:11.270
mentor had been Wacko by the ends before March,

276
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.260
1953 was out barrier how to unilaterally released over a million prisoners from

277
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:19.520
the gulags.
By April he had bans the use of torture across the USSR.

278
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.890
Shortly after that he returned to the passports.

279
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.640
There's over 4 million dissidence who'd been sent into internal exile.

280
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.440
It was a speed and scale of reform that left the Soviet world dizzy.

281
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.341
These work,

282
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.940
just the reforms that barrier actually got around to implementing under his

283
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:39.410
grand division barrier wanted to reunite east and West Germany and then that the

284
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:41.330
vote on whether to remain socialist,

285
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.430
he plans to tone down censorship and allow the various Soviet republics do forge

286
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:48.080
their own national identities.

287
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.260
Something that could easily have led to independence.
It's hard to believe,

288
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:52.800
but barriers,

289
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.360
plans for the Ussr Wa nothing short of an enlightened revolution.

290
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.410
So all of this now raises an interesting question.
How sincere was he?

291
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.920
Clearly barrier was an ambitious man.

292
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.390
Clearly he was also not that thrilled with the direction of Stalin's reign in

293
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:13.860
its last few years,
but as we've already seen,
he was also a murderer,

294
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.340
a sexual predator,
and a semi genocidal monster.

295
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.130
It seems hard to believe that the man who had sends millions to the gulags could

296
00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:26.710
have secretly wanted to release them all along.
Maybe he was a real reform,

297
00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:31.050
or maybe it was all a cynical power play to get the public on his side until he

298
00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:34.290
could snatch the crown from Khrushchev and Mollenkopf.

299
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.150
In a great historical irony,

300
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:39.990
the only other reformer in Stalin's in a circle began to move against a barrier

301
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:42.480
almost as quickly as varia moved against him.

302
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.070
Nikita Khrushchev would go down in history as the Soviet premier who instituted

303
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:48.410
d standardization.
Yes.

304
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.420
In 1953 his only concern was removing the one guy as enthusiastic about reform

305
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.540
as he was for 100 days after Stalin's death barrier.

306
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:00.570
Khrushchev and Mallon golf jostled for power.
Finally,

307
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:02.910
it's something happened that flipped the cards and Chris,

308
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:06.270
Jeff's favor east Germany exploded in revolts.

309
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.220
On June the 16th a factory worker protest in socialist East Germany transformed

310
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:14.700
into a widespread uprising against local communist authorities.

311
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.990
Hundreds of thousands rotted across the nation.
Many more fled to west.

312
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:22.650
By then in the confusion of Stalin's death and barriers reforms,

313
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:26.120
the socialist authorities and east Germany had eased up on that hotline

314
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.790
implementation of socialism and now the people weren't open revolt.

315
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.810
It was all the excuse that barrier's enemies needed back in Moscow.

316
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:38.010
Khrushchev successfully blamed the revolts on barriers regime of liberalization

317
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.960
forcing an alliance with Malin cove.

318
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.140
Malo 12 defense minister Nikolai Bogan in Marshall Zuckoff.

319
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.910
He had arranged for Barea to be called in for a closed meeting at the end of

320
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.910
June.
What happened next is shrouded in mystery.

321
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.320
Khrushchev apparently read a speech furiously denouncing barriers,
crimes,

322
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:56.880
and branding him a traitor.

323
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.170
The climax was meant to be a signal for Madelyn cove to push a hidden button

324
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.760
summoning,
so you call it was men,
but in the heat of the moment he forgotten.

325
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.790
Barrier was able to beg his friends for his life before the officer's finally

326
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:12.030
rushed in.
After that,
everything's just speculation.

327
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.410
One version of the towel has it.

328
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:17.220
The barrier was dragged out to an anteroom and shot in the head before you could

329
00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:20.880
even figure out what was going on and other hazards that he was smuggled out

330
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:25.710
posties own gods and brought to a grotty basement where men versed in NK VD

331
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:28.830
interrogation techniques tend to barriers own methods upon him.

332
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.390
Some say he was tortured,

333
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.470
others say he was simply in prisons before being pulled before a kangaroo court

334
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.020
tried and executed by firing squad.

335
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.980
The only thing we know for certain is that at some points between June the 26th

336
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:44.520
and does official trial on December the 23rd he was killed.

337
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.820
Many sources contends that barrier was dead long before his case went to court

338
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:52.600
and his trial was just a rubber stamp.
The actions already taken.

339
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.980
It said that his body was incinerated and disastrous scattered with a giant fan,

340
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.880
perhaps on surprisingly many of his end KVD associates,
what we'll say.

341
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.410
Rounded up and executed barrier had been stuffing the agency with loyalists from

342
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:10.270
Georgia for years and bloody purge of the whole outfit was inevitable with his

343
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:12.160
death barrier disappeared from history.

344
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:14.650
His name was scrubbed from Soviet records.

345
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:19.310
The mere mention of him was frowned upon his reforms that were addressed or need

346
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:24.100
to be partially implemented again by his old enemy Khrushchev just a few years

347
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.740
later today.
Those living in the west have barely heard of him,

348
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:31.810
but barrier left a peculiar mark on history or maybe perhaps a stain.

349
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:32.830
On the one hand,

350
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.060
he was personally responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths.

351
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.660
He also raped countless women and was probably a serial killer,

352
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:44.200
is left millions of lives shattered and it's weak,

353
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:49.350
but he was also the first reformer to briefly lead the USSR and the first dad to

354
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:52.180
talk about desalinization with his reforms.

355
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:56.020
He could have ushered in a Thor in the cold war or he could have simply steps

356
00:21:56.021 --> 00:22:00.340
the repression right back up again after his enemies when liquidated whilst he

357
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.780
simply amongst,
uh,
or was,
he may be something more as is.

358
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.510
So often the case with history,
the bouncer can sadly,
I mean he be,

359
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.980
we'll never know.
Now just before we end today's video,

360
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:14.890
I do want to take a moment to tell you about Vince.
Sarah watches,

361
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.140
I'm wearing one of these at right now.

362
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:21.130
This is a then Sarah chronic golf as well as keeping perfect time.

363
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.480
It's got a time of the three dials in the back there.
They look great,

364
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:28.750
but they also serve the function of a timeout.

365
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.840
I think talent's a watch with a blue and silver combination,

366
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:34.090
but there are loads of options on the website.

367
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:38.020
You will be sure to find something that suits your style and your risk size.

368
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:40.300
By the way,
I have tiny little risks,

369
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:44.320
so they sent me a smaller version of the watch.
So that was,
that's,

370
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.030
that's really great.
It fits perfectly.

371
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.120
Now I've been putting this watch through its paces over the last few weeks and

372
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:52.870
it's still looking as good as the day I took it out of the box.
Great,

373
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.990
durable Levon,
no scratches on the face,
anything like that.

374
00:22:55.991 --> 00:22:57.910
It's really the king grant.

375
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.660
Then Sarah believes the luxury isn't about price or specification,

376
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:05.500
it's about detail,
it's about craftsmanship and then Sandra washes.

377
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.060
They have a lot of fat unlike many other watches on the market and Sarah isn't

378
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.540
about minimalist style.
It's more about that classic great look of a watch,

379
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.250
which is something I personally love.

380
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:18.910
I think this really sets itself apart from other watches on the market.

381
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:22.420
It's really a good looking thing further by selling direct to the customer of

382
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:26.770
Inserra can deliver a great watch at about a 10th of the price that you might

383
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:27.280
expect.
