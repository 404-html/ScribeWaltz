00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.190
<v Speaker 1>He was a comic genius.</v>

2
00:00:01.191 --> 00:00:06.191
<v Speaker 1>You had only one speed setting and that was full throttle for he burst into our</v>

3
00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>lives as an alien on happy days.</v>

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>He amazed us with his range of talents.</v>

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It's utterly left us breathless.</v>

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.360
<v Speaker 1>behind the stick of Robin Williams was a man who was deeply play,</v>

8
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>goodbye depression.</v>

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>He had other demons such as alcohol and cocaine as well.</v>

10
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

11
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>he kept us entertained to the variant,</v>

12
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.360
<v Speaker 1>which made it all the more unfathomable to his legion of fans and admires me.</v>

13
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Took his life at the age of 63.</v>

14
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>In today's biographics,</v>

15
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>we intend to get the essence of the real Robin Williams.</v>

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Robin mcclaren Williams came into the welds on July the 23rd,</v>

17
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>1951 board at Saint Luke's Hospital in Chicago,</v>

18
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>He was the only child of Laurie and Robert Williams.</v>

20
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>The family was wealthy with Robert to being a senior executive at the Ford Motor</v>

21
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Company.</v>

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Laurie was a full model and two part time actress.</v>

23
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Lots of Robin's formative years were spent a loan in the huge mention that was</v>

24
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>his home.</v>

25
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>In order to cope with his loneliness,</v>

26
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>he created characters and conversations in his head.</v>

27
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>He was an overweight child which lead to bullying at school.</v>

28
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Sixth grade,</v>

29
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>he later recalled was the most difficult year of his life.</v>

30
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Many days he went to crying after constant name calling and physical</v>

31
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>harassments.</v>

32
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Each day was torment for him with his only friends,</v>

33
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>being the ones he created in his own imagination,</v>

34
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>these difficult 20 years.</v>

35
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>They brought on a depression that robin was to grapple with for the rest of his</v>

36
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

37
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Robin began by using comedy as a defense mechanism.</v>

38
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>It started with his mother.</v>

39
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Lori had a very sharp wit and we'd often use humor and laced with sarcasm to</v>

40
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>communicate with her son in order to connect with that.</v>

41
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Robin Hanson make his mother laugh.</v>

42
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good enough to be Robin.</v>

43
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>He had to be funny Robin,</v>

44
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>by the time he was 16,</v>

45
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the family had relocated to California where Robin attended redwood high school.</v>

46
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>It was the late sixties and the straight laced robin found himself in the middle</v>

47
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>of a counter culture that revolved around drugs and sex.</v>

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>He was able to loosen up on after dabbling with marijuana,</v>

49
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>found himself fitting in for the first time.</v>

50
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It was at redwood high that Robin,</v>

51
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>he stumbled upon the drama department.</v>

52
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>He had already perfected his comedic vanilla quickly establishing a reputation</v>

53
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>as the class clown.</v>

54
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>He felt totally in love with the idea of Improv performance is comedic</v>

55
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>personality slowly emerging through drama classes.</v>

56
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

57
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>robin got involved in wrestling and soccer proving to be an accomplished</v>

58
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>

59
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Bonds by the time he graduated in 1969,</v>

60
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
<v Speaker 1>he was voted by his classmates as least likely to succeed.</v>

61
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly though,</v>

62
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>he was also voted funniest students.</v>

63
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>After graduating,</v>

64
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>he attended Claremont men's college is sites.</v>

65
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>They were set on a career in political science before long,</v>

66
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

67
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>he was spending more time in the college theater when he was in lecture rims.</v>

68
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>He won the coveted role of Fagan and the college is production of Oliver Turning</v>

69
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>in a performance that made it clear that he was destined for the limelight even</v>

70
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>behind his diplomatic ambitions.</v>

71
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Robin involved in a community college has a program during classes.</v>

72
00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>See what often improvised living as classmates and teachers in fits of laughter.</v>

73
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>After three years of honing his craft,</v>

74
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.470
<v Speaker 1>he was offered the opportunity of a lifetime full of scholarship or to the</v>

75
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Julliard School of Performing Arts in New York City.</v>

76
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Robin was one of only two students accepted into the 1973 advanced program that</v>

77
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.750
<v Speaker 1>juilliard the other.</v>

78
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>While that was future Superman Christopher Reeve rave,</v>

79
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>who would become a close friend,</v>

80
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>recalled his first impressions.</v>

81
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Upon meeting Williams,</v>

82
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>he wore a tie dye shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked to Marla minutes.</v>

83
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person.</v>

84
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>He was like an Untied Balloon that had been inflated and immediately released.</v>

85
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I watched in horror as he virtually chromed off the walls of the class and</v>

86
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>hallways.</v>

87
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>To say that he was on would be a major understatement.</v>

88
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.671
<v Speaker 1>The juilliard.</v>

89
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:55.211
<v Speaker 1>Well Robin,</v>

90
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>the heat astounded his teachers and fellow students alike.</v>

91
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>He was able to take on epicenter of characters with ease,</v>

92
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>trading out one accent or dialect for another,</v>

93
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>like he was born to do it,</v>

94
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>but with the Robin,</v>

95
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>he was frustrated at juilliard.</v>

96
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't fit in.</v>

97
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.721
<v Speaker 1>After two years,</v>

98
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>his teachers told him that there was nothing more that they could teach him.</v>

99
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>One of his instructors considered robin's via genius.</v>

100
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>He was not being properly served by schools conservative in its classical</v>

101
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.524
<v Speaker 1>training style.</v>

102
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>He left juilliard in 1976 to launch himself onto the world.</v>

103
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>His first stop was the standup circuit on the west coast.</v>

104
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Robin's first break into the realms of comedy.</v>

105
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

106
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Club in the San Francisco Bay area,</v>

107
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.630
<v Speaker 1>his first Gig was it the holy city zoo,</v>

108
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>where he also spent time tending bar.</v>

109
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.870
<v Speaker 1>These early sides.</v>

110
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 1>They were frantic,</v>

111
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.090
<v Speaker 1>bordering on psychotic.</v>

112
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>No one had ever seen anything quite like Robin Williams.</v>

113
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.970
<v Speaker 1>He played a collection of rather edgy characters,</v>

114
00:04:55.971 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>including reverend oral satisfaction is only standup,</v>

115
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>was influenced by the likes of Lenny Bruce Peter Sellers and Jonathan winters is</v>

116
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 1>manage quickfire Adlib routines and off the wall,</v>

117
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>physical comedy proved an absolute hit anti soon established.</v>

118
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:12.560
<v Speaker 1>A loyal following.</v>

119
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Robin loves the immediate feedback that came with standup comedy and it was</v>

120
00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 1>something that he would continue right through his career despite the apparent</v>

121
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.410
<v Speaker 1>ease of his performances.</v>

122
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.730
<v Speaker 1>He actually found stand up incredibly stressful underneath the cloak of exact.</v>

123
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.950
<v Speaker 1>He wants an intensely shy man.</v>

124
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.120
<v Speaker 1>He once said that he started using drugs and alcohol as a crutch to combat stage</v>

125
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:37.121
<v Speaker 1>nuts in 1977 when he moved to Los Angeles where he began performing if a comedy</v>

127
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It was here that he was discovered by TV producer George Schlatter,</v>

128
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 1>who offered him a spot in a revival of the old sixties show.</v>

129
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Often now the show,</v>

130
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

131
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.990
<v Speaker 1>it ultimately didn't survive,</v>

132
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.490
<v Speaker 1>but for Williams it established a foothold into a career in television.</v>

133
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.221

136
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>It was an appearance on the Richard Pryor show,</v>

137
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the brought Williams to the attention of Gary Marshall,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

143
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.310
<v Speaker 1>while they were running out of ideas they,</v>

144
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>they hadn't yet jumped the shark.</v>

145
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>They decided to do an episode taking off the 19 sixties Scifi comedy.</v>

146
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>My favorite Martian,</v>

147
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>the episode when it was called my favorite organ and it called for the costing</v>

148
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.430
<v Speaker 1>of an access to play an alien from the land of Org Marshall Thought Williams</v>

149
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>might be the man for the job in one has gone down as possibly the most brilliant</v>

150
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>audition in TV history,</v>

151
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>rubbing into the room and immediately sat in the chair on his hat.</v>

152
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.480
<v Speaker 1>He continued to do his lines and then broken Zune inspired Adlib Marshall.</v>

153
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It cost him on the spot.</v>

154
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Later commenting that Williams was the only alien who turned up for the part the</v>

155
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>episode of happy days.</v>

156
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>It was originally shot is a dream sequence on the part of Richie Cunningham.</v>

157
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.611
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

158
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>the character played by Williams mork from ork was such a hit with the TV</v>

159
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>watching audience after an initial broadcast that the ending was refilled.</v>

160
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>So mark was a real character.</v>

161
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Once your Robbins' work on the happy days episode was improvised and augmented</v>

162
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 1>with physical comedy,</v>

163
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>audiences couldn't get enough of the Zany adient and demanded much more.</v>

164
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 1>This led to the creation of the spinoff series,</v>

165
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.261
<v Speaker 1>Mork and mindy,</v>

166
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>which ran from 1978 to 1982.</v>

167
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 1>The show catapulted,</v>

168
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Williams do absolute started literally overnight.</v>

169
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>After just two weeks on the APP.</v>

170
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 1>It had zoomed to the top 10 of the Nielsen Ratings,</v>

171
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the producers of the show.</v>

172
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>They kept the script to loose enough to give robin plenty of room to do as he</v>

173
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>pleased,</v>

174
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>and the results were unpredictable over the top until areas.</v>

175
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.291
<v Speaker 1>While the critics,</v>

176
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 1>they weren't overly enthused with the show,</v>

177
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>they went absolutely falling over themselves to lavish praise upon it.</v>

178
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:37.424
<v Speaker 1>Star</v>

179
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>woke up and it quickly became a pop culture phenomenon.</v>

180
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.040
<v Speaker 1>A generation of kids took to warring mark's Trademark Rainbow suspenders and</v>

181
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.960
<v Speaker 1>greeting their friends with the words no,</v>

182
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.740
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

183
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Robin went from relative obscurity to instant fame in the space of a couple of</v>

184
00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

185
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It was something that he was entirely unprepared for and unfortunately it led to</v>

186
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>him indulging in the accessories that come with fame,</v>

187
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.200
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

188
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.430
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and women.</v>

189
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Just Nike acted in the fast lane.</v>

190
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>He also lived his life and the fastest of fast names.</v>

191
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.590
<v Speaker 1>He quickly slipped into the habit of partying into the early hours,</v>

192
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 1>crawling home at five in the morning,</v>

193
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and then having to be on set by 10:00 AM.</v>

194
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt though,</v>

195
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 1>that Robin,</v>

196
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.350
<v Speaker 1>he was blessed with more physical energy than most inevitably.</v>

197
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

198
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.810
<v Speaker 1>that energy began to burn out.</v>

199
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.820
<v Speaker 1>He would sometimes fall asleep on the set.</v>

200
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.340
<v Speaker 1>We'll just sit a dormancy in off mode.</v>

201
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.190
<v Speaker 1>One night after performing a late night set at a comedy club,</v>

202
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>robin met up with fellow comic John Belushi and ended up at the Chateau Marmont</v>

203
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:42.820
<v Speaker 1>where Robin's shared some of blue she's cocaine,</v>

204
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 1>and then left the next day on the set of Mork and Mindy Costar.</v>

205
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Pam dawber broke the news to Williams knew she had died of a drug overdose.</v>

206
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.880
<v Speaker 1>The news well that shot him into making significant changes in his lifestyle.</v>

207
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>The death of Belushi tarnish the image of Hollywood's fastest living brass pack.</v>

208
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Robyn was called to testify before a grand jury and experience which along with</v>

209
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>the shock of Belushi's death and the birth of his first child,</v>

210
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Zach allows him to break free from the strangle hold of drugs and alcohol.</v>

211
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It was at this time that he discovered cycling a form of exercise which you</v>

212
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>credits for saving his life.</v>

213
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.591
<v Speaker 1>After four years,</v>

214
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Mork and mindy had lost its midas touch,</v>

215
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>produces dried whatever they could to resurrect the initial appeal,</v>

216
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but nothing seemed to work.</v>

217
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>They decided to make more,</v>

218
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.561
<v Speaker 1>less naive,</v>

219
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>allowing Williams to work in more of his nightclub act material.</v>

220
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

221
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>the more character and also founded sway into his standup routines,</v>

222
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 1>though not by Robin's design audience members at late night shows,</v>

223
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>we'd simply yell out,</v>

224
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.500
<v Speaker 1>do more,</v>

225
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>switch Robinwood,</v>

226
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.700
<v Speaker 1>frustratingly responds,</v>

227
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 1>or mark's not here.</v>

228
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a different guy.</v>

229
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>By the middle of 1982,</v>

230
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:44.641
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

231
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>the character that had propelled Williams to superstar status was beginning to</v>

232
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 1>feel like a millstone around his neck,</v>

233
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 1>so it came as somewhat of a relief to him when mork and mindy was canceled.</v>

234
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:55.740
<v Speaker 1>After Four Seasons</v>

235
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>in 1976,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shortly after leaving Julliard,</v>

239
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 1>she was a dancer having studied at Julliard herself or they began a relationship</v>

240
00:10:15.671 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that ends after two years were married on June the fourth,</v>

249
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>1983 that have led him to finally shake off his addictions,</v>

250
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>our thought that was one thing that he was not able to control that that was his</v>

251
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:36.901
<v Speaker 1>wondering.</v>

252

<v Speaker 1>I ended up having an affair with a cocktail waitress by the name of Michelle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>1999,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was a previous marriage,</v>

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>he was able to show more of his dramatic acting talents.</v>

291
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 1>The film,</v>

292
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.130

293
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>unconventional and absorbing,</v>

294
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.460

300
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.060
<v Speaker 1>tailor made for Williams as manic style.</v>

301
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

302
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>nearly everything that he did on screen was totally improvised the performance.</v>

303
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It was good enough to earn him an academy award nomination for best actor over</v>

304
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>the next decade.</v>

313
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.500
<v Speaker 1>perhaps Williams's most versatile role was one in which he never actually was on</v>

317

368
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Williams managed to quit alcohol and cocaine in the early 19 eighties,</v>

369
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.370
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

370
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.420
<v Speaker 1>in 2003,</v>

371

<v Speaker 1>he lapse back into alcohol abuse while working on the movie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the big white or location in Alaska for the next three years.</v>

373
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>He denied that he had a problem.</v>

374
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

375
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.540
<v Speaker 1>he was confronted by family and friends who convinced him to check himself into</v>

376
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.420
<v Speaker 1>a substance abuse rehabilitation center in Newburg,</v>

377
00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:43.841
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>

378
00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:48.460
<v Speaker 1>and then he finally admitted that he was an alcoholic after 60 days in Rehab,</v>

379
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.020
<v Speaker 1>rather than responding to his family,</v>

380
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.950
<v Speaker 1>robin began living with a sober companion who was charged with ensuring that he</v>

381
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:54.820
<v Speaker 1>didn't relapse.</v>

382
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.770
<v Speaker 1>It was shortly after that that his wife,</v>

383
00:15:56.771 --> 00:15:57.121
<v Speaker 1>Marcy,</v>

384
00:15:57.121 --> 00:15:58.810
<v Speaker 1>I left him a depressed robin,</v>

385
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.450
<v Speaker 1>did what he always did to get to by when life got tough,</v>

386
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.570
<v Speaker 1>he threw himself into his work going on tour to do stand up,</v>

387
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately in the middle of this tour,</v>

388
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it was discovered that he needed heart surgery.</v>

389
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.640
<v Speaker 1>The operation,</v>

390
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.241
<v Speaker 1>it went well,</v>

391
00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:12.850
<v Speaker 1>but it required quite at rest in order to recuperate.</v>

392
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.530
<v Speaker 1>This forced time of inactivity allowed the demons in his head to have free rein.</v>

393
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Williams is addictive.</v>

394
00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Personality led to marathon cycling and video gaming sessions.</v>

395
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Cycling was a healthy obsession for him,</v>

396
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 1>but for a man who struggled with depression his whole life,</v>

397
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the Ng alone in a room with a computer was very dangerous.</v>

398
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after this,</v>

399
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.470
<v Speaker 1>he began drinking again.</v>

400
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>This time we didn't care who knew in May of 2014 Williams,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the crazy ones was canceled after just one season in July and he was back in</v>

403
00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Rehab.</v>

404
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It was around that time that he also learns that he had Parkinson's disease.</v>

405
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.301
<v Speaker 1>After his death,</v>

406
00:16:46.301 --> 00:16:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it was discovered that what had been diagnosed as Parkinson's was actually lewy</v>

407
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:50.980
<v Speaker 1>body dementia.</v>

408
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:51.903
<v Speaker 1>After his death,</v>

409
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Robin's wife Susan revealed that Robin had been having severe runs,</v>

410
00:16:55.061 --> 00:16:57.370
<v Speaker 1>prolonged episodes of fear and anxiety,</v>

411
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.210
<v Speaker 1>insomnia,</v>

412
00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.961
<v Speaker 1>constipation,</v>

413
00:16:58.961 --> 00:16:59.441
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

414
00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and having friends that have been going on for over a year.</v>

415
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>She said that he would constantly tell her,</v>

416
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I just want to reboot my brain.</v>

417
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.120
<v Speaker 1>On August the 11th,</v>

418
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>

419
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams committed suicide by hanging himself with bells.</v>

420
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.850
