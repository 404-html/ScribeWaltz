<v Speaker 1>young TD relished the opportunity to learn one,</v>

<v Speaker 1>insect,</v>

54

<v Speaker 1>seals and buds that he could analyze and then write about the Roosevelt</v>

55
00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.111
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

56

<v Speaker 1>They were raised under the norms of Victorian society as members of the upper</v>

57
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:42.581
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

58
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 1>They didn't mix with the less wealthy and strict Moore's of decency were</v>

59
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>enforced and manners and politeness.</v>

62
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>church followed by a quiet contemplation.</v>

63
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Titty hated Sundays is,</v>

64
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>this was the day he was not permitted to indulge in his natural curiosity of the</v>

65
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

66
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>In 1869 when he was 10 years old,</v>

67
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>tds family inbox on a tour of Europe for 12 months.</v>

68
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>The children were exposed to the great science of England,</v>

69
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.061
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

70
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:13.451
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

71
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and Italy.</v>

72
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

73
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>TD.</v>

74
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>He was not impressed.</v>

75
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>He lays,</v>

76
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>

77
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I call,</v>

78
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>nearly hated it,</v>

79
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>as did my younger brother and sister.</v>

80
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Practically all the enjoyment we had was an exploring any ruins or mountains</v>

81
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>when we get away from our elders and in playing and all different hotels.</v>

82
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>When he was 13 DDS father gave him his first shotgun.</v>

83
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>He was dismayed to find that he was a terrible shot,</v>

84
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>which brought ridicule from his peers what a friend's challenged him.</v>

85
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>So you had a billboard in the distance.</v>

86
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>He discovered the problem later recalling not only was I able to read the sign,</v>

87
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even see the letters.</v>

88
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>He was extremely near sighted.</v>

89
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>This had never realized it.</v>

90
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>After telling his father about the problem,</v>

91
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>he was given a pair of eyeglasses he wrote in his diary.</v>

92
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea how beautiful the world was until I got those spectacles with is</v>

93
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:02.531
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>

94
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Eyesight.</v>

95
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Didi was able to become even more obsessive with his nature studies.</v>

96
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

97
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Don's tax,</v>

98
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>a dummy stuffing,</v>

99
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>announcing birds that he shot and adding them to is ever expanding natural</v>

100
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.984
<v Speaker 1>history museum.</v>

101
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>In the winter of 1870 to 1871 the Roosevelts made of trips in the Mediterranean</v>

102
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>visiting Egypt,</v>

103
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>the Holyland,</v>

104
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Syria grease and tucking.</v>

105
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the trip to Europe,</v>

106
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 1>TD love this experience.</v>

107
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>He made the most of the opportunity to shoot exotic birds and then stuff them to</v>

108
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>take home and add to his collection.</v>

109
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>When he was 13 TD was sent off to Maine for a solo trip,</v>

110
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>so improve his health on the train journey north.</v>

111
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>He found himself in a cabin with some of the teenage boys in these skinny week.</v>

112
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>The spectical last matic boy,</v>

113
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>they found him easy mock.</v>

114
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>They roughed him up,</v>

115
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 1>beefing him bruised and humiliated when he returns home.</v>

116
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>He told his father about the incidents.</v>

117
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt Sr told his son that he needed to develop as body physically so that</v>

118
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>he could defend himself.</v>

119
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>A prize fighter was hired in order to teach the boy how to box.</v>

120
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>From this point onward TD,</v>

121
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>it became obsessed with building his body.</v>

122
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>He began lifting weights,</v>

123
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>doing calisthenics and running.</v>

124
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>He develops a great admiration for those who possess strength and displayed</v>

125
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>manly virility.</v>

126
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>It was also determined to live what he called the strenuous life.</v>

127
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The Roosevelt's were a family that were driven by goals and afterwards sounding</v>

128
00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>from that trip to the Middle East.</v>

129
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 1>They set one for the oldest son and that was to gain entry to Harvard College in</v>

130
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:31.160
<v Speaker 1>just three years.</v>

131
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Speaker 1>This was a terrific challenge for young TD.</v>

132
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.360
<v Speaker 1>He had never gone to school and is all,</v>

133
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 1>although was skilled in languages nature in the classics.</v>

134
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>He was rather deficient in mathematics.</v>

135
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 1>A special tutor was high and over the next two years he worked hard to improve</v>

136
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:45.134
<v Speaker 1>his skills.</v>

137
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>The hot work get paid often.</v>

138
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.380
<v Speaker 1>In 1875 he passed the Harvard entrance exams for a freshman at Harvard.</v>

139
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:55.970
<v Speaker 1>The Charles had name of TD which never of done so he took to calling himself</v>

140
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Theodore.</v>

141
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He immediately took to college life involving himself in political parades,</v>

142
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>boxing tournaments,</v>

143
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>and a rowing competition.</v>

144
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>He also became a skilled debate or taking on professors and fellow students</v>

145
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>alike to is Deloitte.</v>

146
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>He found himself readily accepted and we've seen invited to join some of</v>

147
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Harvard's most prestigious societies,</v>

148
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>fatals blissful existence there was interrupted during a visit home in his</v>

149
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>sophomore year.</v>

150
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>He found that his father was gravely ill with his beloved TD back home.</v>

151
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>The old man's health revived some Watson.</v>

152
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 1>The dangers seem to have passed,</v>

153
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>but when Theodore returned to Harvard for the new year,</v>

154
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 1>his father took a sharp turn for the worst.</v>

155
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end of February,</v>

156
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Theodore received a telegram to return home urgently.</v>

157
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>He never made it in time.</v>

158
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 1>His father died that very night.</v>

159
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>They had all was deeply depressed as a result of his father's death.</v>

160
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

161
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>he refused to show any of this pain to others instigating a pattern that he</v>

162
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>would continue for the rest of his life.</v>

163
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>He soldiered on disciplining his mind and body to do what had to be done still</v>

164
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>his grief,</v>

165
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>and it was evident in his actions.</v>

166
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>During a summer vacation to oyster bay.</v>

167
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>He rode his horse to exhaustion.</v>

168
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>When a dog insisted on chasing the horse,</v>

169
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>he turned and he shot it.</v>

170
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.250
<v Speaker 1>They had also began hiking,</v>

171
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>finding the release in the great outdoors.</v>

172
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>He teamed with a crusty old adventure by the name of Bill Seawall,</v>

173
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>who served as his guide.</v>

174
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.571
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

175
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll later recorded his impression of Theodore Roosevelt at the time stating he</v>

176
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 1>was fair minded.</v>

177
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Theodore was zen's.</v>

178
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Then he took pains to learn everything.</v>

179
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>That was nothing beneath his notice.</v>

180
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I liked him right off.</v>

181
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I liked him clear though that wasn't a quality in him.</v>

182
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:29.984
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like.</v>

183
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't had long or aggressive except when necessary and just far as I could</v>

184
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

185
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a bit cocky though.</v>

186
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.301
<v Speaker 1>Other folks' thoughts.</v>

187
00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 1>So by his mid teens,</v>

188
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Theodore had developed into quite a character,</v>

189
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>never afraid to express his opinion.</v>

190
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>He could always be counted on to be the center of attention is unique.</v>

191
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Albus it's of approval.</v>

192
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Bully and de Lighters quickly became trademark responses.</v>

193
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>In 1879 he set his charms on a young woman by the name of Annesley.</v>

194
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>See that girl?</v>

195
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

196
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:57.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

197
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:57.681
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

198
00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>vid pal,</v>

199
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>she won't have me,</v>

200
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to have her and have her.</v>

201
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

202
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>He says out on a campaign to win the Ellis' heart leading to their engagements</v>

203
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 1>in early 1880 they had all graduated from Harvard in June of that year,</v>

204
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>the 21st and this class of 160 students.</v>

205
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Then in October,</v>

206
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>he and Dallas,</v>

207
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.623
<v Speaker 1>we're married,</v>

208
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>offer a short honeymoon.</v>

209
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Theodore enrolled in a law degree at Columbia University while also working at</v>

210
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>his uncle's law fan.</v>

211
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>During his limited leisure time,</v>

212
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>he decided to learn about the war of 1812 when we couldn't find a decent book on</v>

213
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>the subject.</v>

214
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>He decided to write one himself during the summer of 1881 the young couple took</v>

215
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>a trip to Europe while in Switzerland's Theodore left his wife behind while he</v>

216
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>climbs the matter one.</v>

217
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It was during this trip that he decided to forego a legal career and he was</v>

218
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 1>determined to set his sights on becoming a politician.</v>

219
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Back.</v>

220
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Politics was actually</v>

221
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>seen as being beneath men of wealth and various friends tried to dissuade</v>

222
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Theodore's ambitions,</v>

223
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>but that was always going to be a losing proposition.</v>

224
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>And on returning to New York,</v>

225
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>he joined the Republican Party.</v>

226
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

227
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>He was associating with a class of men that he hadn't previously mixed with</v>

228
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>rough men who were skilled in the low blows and dirty tricks of stage politics.</v>

229
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt soon learns their ways and within months he had won the party's</v>

230
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>nomination for a seat in the New York state assembly.</v>

231
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>It was a solid Republican sesions Roosevelt's,</v>

232
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 1>he won it handily,</v>

233
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt tens up to take his seat to the New York state capitol in Albany on</v>

234
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:36.261
<v Speaker 1>January the 22nd 1882 he cut the figure of a dandy with is fine suit and his</v>

235
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>upper crust ways.</v>

236
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>He was ridiculed by Democrats as well as Republicans.</v>

237
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.581
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>

238
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:41.881
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

239
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>according to his own recollection,</v>

240
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>rose like a rocket ship in New York,</v>

241
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

242
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt politics.</v>

243
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 1>They were grounded in self determination.</v>

244
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>He firmly believed that each man was in control of his own destiny,</v>

245
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but he also realized that the system,</v>

246
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>it was grossly unfair with those with the money and power having all of the</v>

247
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.004
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

248
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 1>He made it his goal to bring about a fairer assist and were all Americans have</v>

249
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to succeed when he wasn't working his way up the political</v>

250
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>ladder in New York theater or ventured out west in order to fulfill his love of</v>

251
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 1>adventure and the outdoors.</v>

252
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 1>In September of 1883 he made an excursion to the Dakota badlands with the</v>

253
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 1>express purpose of bringing home a buffalo had as a trophy as with most things</v>

254
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>he set his mind to.</v>

255
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>He was successful in that goal.</v>

256
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>During this trivial also purchased a cattle ranch in November of 1883 Theodore</v>

257
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>won his third terms of the New York state assembly.</v>

258
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 1>He returns to Alberni while his wife who was heavily pregnant with their first</v>

259
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

260
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 1>went to live with his sister.</v>

261
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 1>On February the 11th 1884 he received a long awaited telegram announcing the</v>

262
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 1>birth of the baby girl.</v>

263
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>But this telegram had also told him that Alice was very sick.</v>

264
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>He rushed home to discover that the news was even worse,</v>

265
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.550
<v Speaker 1>both his wife and his mother or gravely ill.</v>

266
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 1>They both died on the same day.</v>

267
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 1>February the 14th 1884 that night he wrote in his diary.</v>

268
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>The light has gone from my life.</v>

269
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Theodore responded to the double tragedy with the stoicism that epitomized as</v>

270
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:14.094
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

271
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>After a few days of isolation be left the baby in the care of his sister and</v>

272
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>returned to Albany to see out his time and the general assembly life,</v>

273
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have to go on [inaudible].</v>

274
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Energy for Roosevelt works tirelessly to propel himself from state to national</v>

275
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

276
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 1>His Brash on wavering style brought into the attention of prominent men,</v>

277
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>including an influential Bostonian by the name of Henry Cabot Lodge.</v>

278
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.370
<v Speaker 1>By the ends of the year,</v>

279
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 1>the 25 year old was being hired by many as a future Republican leader.</v>

280
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

281
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 1>inside Roosevelt was an empty man.</v>

282
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>He needed to get away from the rough and tumble of politics in order to heal</v>

283
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:51.474
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

284
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>At the end of 1884 Roosevelt retired from politics and moved to one of his</v>

285
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>ranches in North Dakota.</v>

286
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Theodore Roosevelt turns up to the small Dakota town of the door addressed in</v>

287
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:08.164
<v Speaker 1>Buckskins.</v>

288
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 1>He brandished a brand new Winchester rifle as well as a hunting knife that had</v>

289
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>bought from Tiffany's jewelers.</v>

290
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He was the quintessential dude and was soon ridiculed by the hardened locals.</v>

291
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.061
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>

292
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>he revels in life.</v>

293
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>In the West.</v>

294
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 1>He displayed a steely courage,</v>

295
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 1>which impressed all those who came to know him.</v>

296
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt hired his old tramping guide bill seewell to come out and manage his</v>

297
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:30.484
<v Speaker 1>ranch for him,</v>

298
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.010
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't leave all the hard work to his men.</v>

299
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.510
<v Speaker 1>He rode out on the range with them,</v>

300
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 1>chased spooked cattle and stood guard during long and bitterly cold nights.</v>

301
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>In 1886 he captured a group of thieves who would start on a boat and then took</v>

302
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 1>them as prisoners on a three day trek to the local sheriff.</v>

303
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 1>During those three days.</v>

304
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>He didn't sleep a wink cause he kept his rifle trained on his captives following</v>

305
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:58.081
<v Speaker 1>the exceptionally harsh winter of 1886 to 1887 which kills half of his cattle</v>

306
00:12:58.181 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>stock,</v>

307
00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:59.643
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt.</v>

308
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>He returned east.</v>

309
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It was 30 pounds heavier than when he left and was a harder,</v>

310
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:06.070
<v Speaker 1>more confidence fashion of itself.</v>

311
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Soon after resenting,</v>

312
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 1>he matched dolphins.</v>

313
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I fell in love with a childhood friend by the name of Edith Kero.</v>

314
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 1>They were married on December the second 1886 and would go on to have five</v>

315
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.294
<v Speaker 1>children together.</v>

316
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt was soon approached by Republican leaders,</v>

317
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.930
<v Speaker 1>urge to reenter politics.</v>

318
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.480
<v Speaker 1>They wanted him to run for mayor of New York.</v>

319
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.320
<v Speaker 1>He accepted and campaigned hard despite having little chance of winning.</v>

320
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.420
<v Speaker 1>He came in third place with 27% of the vote thinking that his political career</v>

321
00:13:38.421 --> 00:13:38.961
<v Speaker 1>was over.</v>

322
00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:41.900
<v Speaker 1>He next put his efforts into writing the book,</v>

323
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the winning of the West.</v>

324
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.720
<v Speaker 1>In 1888 Roosevelt gave stump speeches for Republican presidential candidates.</v>

325
00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Harrison.</v>

326
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.090
<v Speaker 1>When he won the presidency,</v>

327
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Harrison was persuaded by Theodore's political champion,</v>

328
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Henry Cabot Lodge to appoints the energetic Roosevelt's to the u s a Civil</v>

329
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Service Commission.</v>

330
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.410
<v Speaker 1>He spoke to the role with a vengeance.</v>

331
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean to find to the curb to spoil system and enforce civil service</v>

332
00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:04.730
<v Speaker 1>doors.</v>

333
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.990
<v Speaker 1>In 1894 Roosevelt was appointed president of the board of New York City Police</v>

334
00:14:08.991 --> 00:14:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Commissioners.</v>

335
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 1>He then set about making improvements,</v>

336
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:15.380
<v Speaker 1>do these structure of the police force rooting out corruption and imposing more</v>

337
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:17.390
<v Speaker 1>stringent standards for recruitment.</v>

338
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>In 1897 again,</v>

339
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:21.080
<v Speaker 1>under the urging of Henry Cabot Lodge,</v>

340
00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:24.890
<v Speaker 1>new President William Mckinley appointed Roosevelt as the assistant secretary of</v>

341
00:14:24.891 --> 00:14:25.520
<v Speaker 1>the navy.</v>

342
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.210
<v Speaker 1>He became a strong advocate for the building of the strength of the navy.</v>

343
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:34.220
<v Speaker 1>When on February the 15th 1898 the u s watershed mean exploded in Havana.</v>

344
00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Harbor Roosevelt took it upon himself to order a number of ships.</v>

345
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you prepare for war?</v>

346
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 1>When war was declared a short time later,</v>

347
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt resigned his post and forms the first US volunteer cavalry regimens.</v>

348
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.130
<v Speaker 1>He was determined to be in the thick of the action.</v>

349
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.573
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

350
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.031
<v Speaker 1>press stubs,</v>

351
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt's Cavalry Regiment,</v>

352
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>the rough riders.</v>

353
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 1>After a period of training in San Antonio,</v>

354
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>

355
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>they were shipped to Cuba.</v>

356
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 1>That first action was at the battle of last quest cmos where they forced the</v>

357
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Spanish to a band and they're entrenched positions.</v>

358
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 1>On July the first 1898 Roosevelt led his men on the famous charge up cattle</v>

359
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:14.780
<v Speaker 1>hill.</v>

360
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It was the only man on horseback making an easy target for the enemy.</v>

361
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Still without any care for his own safety.</v>

362
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>He rode up and down the line [inaudible] man off the hill,</v>

363
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 1>also attempting to take the hill where soldiers of the ninth us cavalry,</v>

364
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but these soldiers were having a hard time of it.</v>

365
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 1>A reporter for the New York Times recorded the action stating Cardinal</v>

366
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt's on horseback broke from the woods behind the line of the ninth and</v>

367
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.530
<v Speaker 1>finding it's men buying in his way.</v>

368
00:15:37.531 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 1>He shouted,</v>

369
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 1>if you do not wish to go forward,</v>

370
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.810
<v Speaker 1>let my men pass please.</v>

371
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>The junior officers of the ninth with their negroes instantly sprang into line</v>

372
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:49.550
<v Speaker 1>with the rough riders since charged at the blue block house on the right.</v>

373
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I speak of Roosevelt first because he was without a doubt the most conspicuous</v>

374
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 1>figure in the charge.</v>

375
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt mounted high on horseback and then charging the rifle pits at a gallop</v>

376
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and quiet alone made you feel that you would like to.</v>

377
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Chia,</v>

378
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.540
<v Speaker 1>he wore on his Sombrero I blue Polka dot handkerchief,</v>

379
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 1>which has the advanced floated out straight behind his head like a guide on</v>

380
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 1>having reached the crest of the hill.</v>

381
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt dismounted and urged his men to follow him,</v>

382
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>but that was yet another hill to conquer and no sooner had the rough riders</v>

383
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:18.230
<v Speaker 1>scrambled to the top of cattle hill.</v>

384
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Then that dashing carnal set off for San Juan Hill as men overpowered the</v>

385
00:16:22.491 --> 00:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Spanish resistance and took possession of both hills in the process.</v>

386
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt's killed to Spanish tree bub,</v>

387
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 1>who he said doubled over like a jack rabbits following victory in Cuba,</v>

388
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt returned to New York,</v>

389
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:33.971
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

390
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 1>It was convinced to run for governor campaigning vigorously on his war record.</v>

391
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 1>He won by just 1% of the popular vote during his time as governor,</v>

392
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 1>he developed the stylings platform,</v>

393
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 1>which would underpin his leisure presidency.</v>

394
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>It was a passionate advocate for the rights of the underprivileged was against</v>

395
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>large corporations and monopolies and champions.</v>

396
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 1>The preservation of natural resources.</v>

397
00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:00.080
<v Speaker 1>In 1900 Henry Cabot lodge and other prominent Republicans urge Roosevelt's to</v>

398
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>throw his hat into the ring for the vacants Republican vice-presidential spot in</v>

399
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 1>the upcoming presidential elections.</v>

400
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.543
<v Speaker 1>Though reluctance,</v>

401
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>he won the Republican nomination pairing with President Mckinley with his</v>

402
00:17:11.151 --> 00:17:11.961
<v Speaker 1>boundless energy.</v>

403
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>He threw himself into a barn storming campaign,</v>

404
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:19.451
<v Speaker 1>making 480 speeches in 23 states in the end and Mckinley easily one and Theodore</v>

405
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt was sworn in as the vice president of the United States on March the</v>

406
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>first 1901 six months later,</v>

407
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 1>President Mckinley was shot while attending the Pan American exposition in New</v>

408
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

409
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 1>He died eight days later as a result of the 42 year old Roosevelt who was</v>

410
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 1>propelled into the highest office in the lands becoming the 26th president of</v>

411
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:45.341
<v Speaker 1>the United States on September the 14th 1901 he was the youngest man to ever</v>

412
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>hold the position.</v>

413
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt was very different man to William Mckinley still valid and that he</v>

414
00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 1>would continue to pursue with the policies of his predecessor.</v>

415
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.051
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

416
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>he was determined to do stamp his mark on the presidency in order to win a</v>

417
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:06.600
<v Speaker 1>second term in his own right.</v>

418
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 1>A large part of the focus of Roosevelt's domestic policies were focused on</v>

419
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 1>breaking up the monopolies of big business.</v>

420
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.080
<v Speaker 1>He instituted 44 antitrust suits forcing the breaking up of the Northern</v>

421
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Securities Company and putting regulatory controls on standard oil of all the</v>

422
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 1>domestic policies that Roosevelt was passionate about.</v>

423
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

424
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 1>none came close to the preservation of wildlife than the environments he</v>

425
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:29.701
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

426
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 1>The United States forest service created five national parks and place to total</v>

427
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:37.260
<v Speaker 1>of 230 million acres of lands under public protection.</v>

428
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.610
<v Speaker 1>In terms of foreign policy,</v>

429
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt,</v>

430
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 1>he was an ardent imperialists.</v>

431
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 1>He successfully mediated the treaty of Portsmouth,</v>

432
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>which brought an end to the Russian Japanese war winning a Nobel peace prize for</v>

433
00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 1>his efforts.</v>

434
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>It was making a deal with the Panamanian government for the building of a canal</v>

435
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:56.241
<v Speaker 1>led to the separation of Panama from Columbia in 1903 and the 1904 presidential</v>

436
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.061
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

437
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:01.000
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats put up Alton Brooks Parker to face off against Roosevelt</v>

438
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.260
<v Speaker 1>campaigning on the promise to give every American a square deal.</v>

439
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:09.261
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt one that 56% of the popular vote along with 336 of 476 electorial</v>

440
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 1>votes during a second time and office Roosevelt and began moving to the left of</v>

441
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 1>his Republican base,</v>

442
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 1>the Bush for a number of pretty radical reforms including the eight hour</v>

443
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:19.950
<v Speaker 1>workday,</v>

444
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 1>most of which they were defeated in the house.</v>

445
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 1>He had Declan's that he would not seek a third term and so he became a lame</v>

446
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:26.311
<v Speaker 1>duck.</v>

447
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Presidents while thought early in drawing the role of presidents,</v>

448
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:33.390
<v Speaker 1>he fells staying in office for more than two terms would run the risk of</v>

449
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:34.224
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship</v>

450
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>following the end of his second term in office.</v>

451
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 1>In March of 1909 Roosevelt went on an African safari with a group of prominent</v>

452
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.850
<v Speaker 1>scientists and hunters.</v>

453
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 1>The expedition was on behalf of the Smithsonian Institute and was charged with</v>

454
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.840
<v Speaker 1>bringing back specimens for the institutes museums.</v>

455
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 1>The trip was successful in the group,</v>

456
00:19:56.251 --> 00:20:01.251
<v Speaker 1>came back with 11,400 specimens ranging from insects to elephants.</v>

457
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>When he returned to the United States,</v>

458
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt was far from happy with the performance of his successor,</v>

459
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 1>William Taft,</v>

460
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>to believing that Taft has made the Republican's far too conservative.</v>

461
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.400
<v Speaker 1>He began to speak loudly of leading a program of new nationalism which emphasize</v>

462
00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Labor over capital.</v>

463
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.240
<v Speaker 1>By the time that the 1912 presidential election rolled around,</v>

464
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt was convinced that only he could save the Republican Party.</v>

465
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.260
<v Speaker 1>He challenge Taft in the Republican primary.</v>

466
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

467
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.251
<v Speaker 1>the Taft won.</v>

468
00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The nomination is squeezing Roosevelt to the sidelines.</v>

469
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Undeterred Roosevelt quit the Republican's forming his own party,</v>

470
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 1>the progressive's,</v>

471
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and he ran for president as an independence.</v>

472
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>He then went to the stumps and appealed to the people.</v>

473
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 1>On October the 14th 1912 Roosevelt was giving a speech in Milwaukee,</v>

474
00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin when he was struck by an assassin's bullet.</v>

475
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 1>This shot was a perfect shot to the heart and it penetrated his breast pocket</v>

476
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 1>and slammed into a thick glasses case.</v>

477
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>The bullets then thumped into a heavy speech.</v>

478
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Manuscripts that he had chosen not to use without missing a beat,</v>

479
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt ensured that the would be killer was apprehended.</v>

480
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Then he went right on with his speech,</v>

481
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.211
<v Speaker 1>the first word,</v>

482
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.640
<v Speaker 1>so the crowd after being headwear.</v>

483
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.693
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

484
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether you're fully understands that I have just been shot,</v>

485
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 1>but it takes more than that to kill a bull loose.</v>

486
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.080
<v Speaker 1>The bullet stayed in Roosevelt's pectoral muscle until his death,</v>

487
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 1>the 1912 presidential election.</v>

488
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 1>It was won by the Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson with 42% of the popular</v>

489
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

490
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.341
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

491
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:32.341
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt did to beat the incumbent presidents with 27% compared to 23% for Taft</v>

492
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 1>during a South American expedition.</v>

493
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:40.351
<v Speaker 1>In 1913 to 1914 Roosevelt contracted tropical fever after suffering a leg wound,</v>

494
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 1>which became badly infected by the time he resides in New York,</v>

495
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 1>he was 50 pounds lighter and deathly Pale.</v>

496
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>The last few years were racked with pain for the ones robust outdoor adventurer,</v>

497
00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.980
<v Speaker 1>malaria bounce,</v>

498
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 1>where common as where complications of his leg inflammation.</v>

499
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 1>The end came in the very early morning hours of January the sixth 1919 after he</v>

500
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:09.610
<v Speaker 1>had complained about not being able to breathe the night before the doctor was</v>

501
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 1>summons and after some treatments he felt better.</v>

502
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.910
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

503
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>he died in his sleep as a result of a blood clot in the lungs.</v>

504
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.920
<v Speaker 1>When he heard of his father's demise,</v>

505
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>his oldest son,</v>
