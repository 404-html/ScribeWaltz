00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Charles darwin,</v>

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>the miles managed son of a physician was once described as the most dangerous</v>

3
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:06.084
<v Speaker 1>man in England.</v>

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

5
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>many people would consider them to be the agents of the devil himself come to</v>

6
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>sow seeds of corruption.</v>

7
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Among the faithful is ideas struck like a storm at the very foundation of</v>

8
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>society turning conventional religious thought on its hat.</v>

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Just a few years earlier,</v>

11
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>he had his sights set on becoming a priest and devoting his life to God.</v>

12
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics we investigate the life and the ideas of Charles</v>

13
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.173
<v Speaker 1>Darwin.</v>

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Charles Robert Darwin was born in Shrewsbury,</v>

15
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:48.721
<v Speaker 1>England on February the 12th 1809 his father Robert was a doctor and his mother</v>

16
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Susanna.</v>

17
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It was the daughter of the famous potteries owner,</v>

18
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Josiah Wedgwood jars.</v>

19
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>His grandfather was Erasmus Darwin,</v>

20
00:00:56.561 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>well known in his time as a scientist with unusual ideas.</v>

21
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>He wrote on a range of subjects including travel by air.</v>

22
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>We're exploring by submarine and evolution.</v>

23
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Despite his learned father and eminence grandfather Charles,</v>

24
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>his early years were not outstanding.</v>

25
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>He attended Shrewsbury School were the main lessons where in the classics such</v>

26
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:17.254
<v Speaker 1>as Latin,</v>

27
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>his school masters and his father considered them to be a boy of very ordinary</v>

28
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>intelligence despite his apparent lack of promise.</v>

29
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Charles showed a great interest in learning boss rather than studying Greek and</v>

30
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>in like most of the students of the time,</v>

31
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>he was taken with the English poetry of William Wordsworth and Lord Byron.</v>

32
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>When Charles was a teenager,</v>

33
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>science began to captivate them so much so in fact that he had his brother</v>

34
00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Erasmus build a chemistry lab in a garden shed in 1825 Charles attended</v>

35
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Edinburgh medical school in Scotland,</v>

36
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but he was not a good medical students.</v>

37
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>He found the lectures dull.</v>

38
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Ma'Ams had to leave the operating theater because he could not stand the horrors</v>

39
00:01:56.711 --> 00:01:57.544
<v Speaker 1>of surgery.</v>

40
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>One thing he did enjoy though was the study of taxidermy,</v>

41
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.930
<v Speaker 1>which he learns from a format African slave named John Edmondson.</v>

42
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>During his second year in Scotland,</v>

43
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Darwin joins the Plinian Society,</v>

44
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>a club for naturalists.</v>

45
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>He was taken with that intellectual debates,</v>

46
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>which exposed him to ideas of how man was created,</v>

47
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 1>not buying guns,</v>

48
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but by gradual changes in form.</v>

49
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:24.374
<v Speaker 1>Over time,</v>

50
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>these ideas had been espoused by Charles,</v>

51
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>his own grandfather,</v>

52
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.461
<v Speaker 1>Erasmus,</v>

53
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Darwin,</v>

54
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>while of the university,</v>

55
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:30.741
<v Speaker 1>Darwin Matters.</v>

56
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Ecologist named Robert Grants,</v>

57
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>and the two became close friends.</v>

58
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Grant has been credited with being the first person to interest Darwin in the</v>

59
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>theory of evolution.</v>

60
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>At this time,</v>

61
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Charles began collecting fossils since learning more about animal life,</v>

62
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>so the great disappointment of his father Charles quit medical school in 1827 he</v>

63
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>joined his uncle Josiah Wedgwood,</v>

64
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:56.171
<v Speaker 1>the second for a trip to Paris as see vacations his father still fretting over</v>

65
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>his son dropping out of medical school,</v>

66
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>made plans for Charles to study for the clergy enrolling him.</v>

67
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>It's Christ's College Cambridge University.</v>

68
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Despite the evolutionary ideas that had been filling his mind's during his time</v>

69
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>at Edinburgh,</v>

70
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Charles still held to a belief in creation.</v>

71
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.243
<v Speaker 1>Later he rose.</v>

72
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I did not then in the least doubt,</v>

73
00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>these strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible.</v>

74
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>During the summer before his studies began,</v>

75
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Charles fell in love with a girl by the name of Fanny Oh in the sister of one of</v>

76
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>his friends.</v>

77
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>They spend long hours talking,</v>

78
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>riding horses and playing cards.</v>

79
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's theological studies at Cambridge began towards the end of 1827 but</v>

80
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>rather than getting immersed in the Bible,</v>

81
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>he developed a fondness for collecting beetles.</v>

82
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>He attended lectures on botany given bunny the reverend John Stevens Henslow.</v>

83
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Darwin saw this as a possible career path and he pursued his studies with</v>

84
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm.</v>

85
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>By ACR 29 it became clear that Darwin had no interest in joining the clergy.</v>

86
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>He spent that spring break with the Reverend Frederick hope and noted</v>

87
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>entomologist.</v>

88
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's obsession with the study of Beatle Song,</v>

89
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>no time for his budding romance with fanny,</v>

90
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>and they broke up that following spring.</v>

91
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Despite his general lack of interest in his clerical studies,</v>

92
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Darwin past his finals exam in January,</v>

93
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>1831 basing 10 fitness class finished with school.</v>

94
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>He was all set to become a countryside clergy or the edge one with a deep</v>

95
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>scientific interest,</v>

96
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>but reverend Hansley who had become something of a mentor to Charles suggested</v>

97
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>that he should see some of the world's before he settled down to his posting to</v>

98
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>oh in decided to take a trip to the Canary Islands off the coast of Spain.</v>

99
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>He plans to go with his friend's Momma do Ramsey.</v>

100
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>They intended to study the geological formations on the islands,</v>

101
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>but before they could set sail,</v>

102
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Ramsey died.</v>

103
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly Darwin was stricken with grief and could not travel to the islands.</v>

104
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks later he received a letter from reverend Henslow informing him that</v>

105
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>there was an opening on a ship that may interest him.</v>

106
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>The HMS Beagle,</v>

107
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>which was bound for South America.</v>

108
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>The bagel was being repaired as one of several ships scheduled to map South</v>

109
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

110
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.481
<v Speaker 1>Robert Fitzroy,</v>

111
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>the captain of the Beagle,</v>

112
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>recognize that the long voyage would require for a variety of men to be on board</v>

113
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>for companionship.</v>

114
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>He was keen to have a scholar gentlemen who could help describe the areas that</v>

115
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>were being charted as well as to relieve the TDM between ports of call.</v>

116
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>When the opening presented itself,</v>

117
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was keen to fill the spot.</v>

118
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

119
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 1>his father Roberts refused to give his adult son permission to embark on a</v>

120
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>voyage.</v>

121
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Robert's continued to believe that Charles,</v>

122
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>his interest in science was merely a passing fad and that the young man remained</v>

123
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>adrift.</v>

124
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It was left to Charles,</v>

125
00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>his uncle Joe Cya to step in and to persuade his brother to give permission for</v>

126
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>his son to join the expedition.</v>

127
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Charles then hastened to London's and meet with caps in Fitzroy in the hope of</v>

128
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>that the offer was still available.</v>

129
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 1>He was in luck with plans for a September departure,</v>

130
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>gradually moved back the ship.</v>

131
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Finally set sail on Tuesday,</v>

132
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:59.071
<v Speaker 1>December the 27th 1831 Darwin found himself in a small cabin that was nine feet</v>

133
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>by 11 feet long and only five feet high.</v>

134
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Part of his cabin was taken over by one of the masts rising through it from the</v>

135
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

136
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.843
<v Speaker 1>He was seasick.</v>

137
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>A condition that remained over the next five years.</v>

138
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>On January the 16th 1830 do the big or stopped at Cape Verde off the western</v>

139
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>coast of Africa,</v>

140
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>her Darwin founder band of fossil shells,</v>

141
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>45 feet above sea level.</v>

142
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>How he wondered the fossils rise so high.</v>

143
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>After 23 days,</v>

144
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>the crew was set out for Brazil arriving in the port city of Salvador at the end</v>

145
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.940
<v Speaker 1>of February,</v>

146
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>1832 are up to spring.</v>

147
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>The big old traveled along the Brazilian coast stopping in many ports at each</v>

148
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

149
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Darwin took long hikes.</v>

150
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Collecting many specimens he could likes is a huge number of specimens which he</v>

151
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>carefully catalogs and protected on board Fitzroy and the crew.</v>

152
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>They consider this work worthless and is growing collection a load of junk,</v>

153
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>but to trials,</v>

154
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>they were precious scientific discoveries.</v>

155
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Every few months.</v>

156
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>He arranged for a shipments to be sent back to reverend Henslow in Cambridge for</v>

157
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>safekeeping from Brazil,</v>

158
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>the Beagle at sales to Patagonia,</v>

159
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>a large region of South America that is now Argentina.</v>

160
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>They're Darwin collected fossils,</v>

161
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:10.660
<v Speaker 1>bits of bone and feathers that he had never before encountered.</v>

162
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He struggles to accurately record their features in the hopes that more</v>

163
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>experienced naturalists could later help to identify them from Patagonia.</v>

164
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>The Beagle went further to Tierra del Fuego.</v>

165
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>It was here that Darwin encountered native people who still dwells in the jungle</v>

166
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>and were considered to be at savages by the Europeans.</v>

167
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>By march of 1833 the crew of the Beagle began mapping the Falkland Islands,</v>

168
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>which the British had claimed from Argentina actress months earlier,</v>

169
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by the burdens animal fossils found that Darwin spent his time</v>

170
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>comparing the specimens with everything he had collected to date the work that</v>

171
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was immersed in.</v>

172
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It was becoming so exhaustive that he recognized the need to take on a servant.</v>

173
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>He wrote home to his father asking for the money to hire someone.</v>

174
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 1>When permission came back,</v>

175
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>he asked the ships odd job,</v>

176
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

177
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.021
<v Speaker 1>sims coverings,</v>

178
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>and to take on the role.</v>

179
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.971
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

180
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the letters that Charles had been sending back to reverend tens low were being</v>

181
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 1>read aloud to the Philosophical Society of Cambridge.</v>

182
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 1>This owns Darwin and early reputation as an excellent naturalist and observer on</v>

183
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's 25th birthday.</v>

184
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Captain Fitzroy names the highest mountain in the Tierra del Fuego region</v>

185
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.320
<v Speaker 1>mounts.</v>

186
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Darwin in Charles is on that by 1834 the ship had sailed round Cape Horn at the</v>

187
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>southern tip of South America and crossed from the Atlantic to the Pacific</v>

188
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Ocean.</v>

189
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.101
<v Speaker 1>During the summer,</v>

190
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Darwin became quite ill.</v>

191
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 1>He was deemed too sick to continue the voyage and spent four frustrating months</v>

192
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>in Tierra del Fuego.</v>

193
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Recovering.</v>

194
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Historians believe that he had chagas disease,</v>

195
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of sniffing sickness.</v>

196
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Though in returns of the Beagle in November of 1834 the ship rounded Cape Horn</v>

197
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>and sales up self,</v>

198
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>America's west coast.</v>

199
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>On February the 20th 1835 a great earthquake shook the region and during the</v>

200
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>boards of Concepcion in Chile,</v>

201
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Darwin saw the appalling damage.</v>

202
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>He also noted that the rocks around the harbor had been lifted almost a meter by</v>

203
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the earth's movements,</v>

204
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>shellfish and seaweeds,</v>

205
00:08:58.321 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>which were normally near the water.</v>

206
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>We're now high and dry,</v>

207
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>so could such catastrophic changes in the surroundings.</v>

208
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 1>The linked to changes in parts and animals is what he wondered.</v>

209
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.920
<v Speaker 1>The Beagle now left South America and set sail across the Pacific Ocean almost a</v>

210
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.973
<v Speaker 1>thousand kilometers from the mainland.</v>

211
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>It angered does a group of about 13 small rocky islands on the equator.</v>

212
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>These were of course the Galapagos Islands.</v>

213
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was immediately struck by the strange nature of the birds,</v>

214
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>reptiles and others that he found that they seemed unique to these islands.</v>

215
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Yet they had many similarities to species founds on these South American</v>

216
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 1>mainland's stranger still each island had its own kind of animal.</v>

217
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>One example was the giant tortoises winning more than 200 kilograms,</v>

218
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>which the ship's crew right around like horses.</v>

219
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>The local people could tell which island did tortoise came from by the shape of</v>

220
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:46.674
<v Speaker 1>its shell.</v>

221
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was especially intrigued by one group of birds,</v>

222
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.803
<v Speaker 1>the finches,</v>

223
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>they were mostly small and drab,</v>

224
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:54.481
<v Speaker 1>Brown in color,</v>

225
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>but each species had a slightly different size and shape of beak allowing it to</v>

226
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>tackle a certain kind of food.</v>

227
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Darwin noted in his notebook,</v>

228
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>one made really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in the archipelago,</v>

229
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>one species had been taken and modified for different ends.</v>

230
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 1>The idea of evolution,</v>

231
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.580
<v Speaker 1>but it was beginning to take root.</v>

232
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.660
<v Speaker 1>The bagel sailed on across the Pacific to Tahiti where Darwin fell in love with</v>

233
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>the misty peaks,</v>

234
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:20.460
<v Speaker 1>tropical plants,</v>

235
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>colorful animals,</v>

236
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 1>and these simple natural lifestyle of the local people.</v>

237
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>The journey continued on towards New Zealand and then Australia.</v>

238
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>He was shocked at the terrible living conditions of the local people and the own</v>

239
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:32.611
<v Speaker 1>lands.</v>

240
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>They were ruled over and made slaves by European settlers.</v>

241
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 1>This seemed to support his observations from the animal world that the stronger</v>

242
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.140
<v Speaker 1>always took over from the week.</v>

243
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.073
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

244
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.820
<v Speaker 1>The Beagle returned to Fallon,</v>

245
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Speaker 1>the thing balloons on the 2nd of October,</v>

246
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>1836.</v>

247
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>They had been away for five years.</v>

248
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's spend the next few years organizing and cataloging his vast collection</v>

249
00:10:55.761 --> 00:10:56.420
<v Speaker 1>of plants,</v>

250
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

251
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>rocks,</v>

252
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.363
<v Speaker 1>and fossils.</v>

253
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.080
<v Speaker 1>By the summer of 1838,</v>

254
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Darwin felt bold enough to share his radical ideas with this father.</v>

255
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.860
<v Speaker 1>We took them in his straight for the last several months.</v>

256
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Charles had struck up a close relationship with his cousin,</v>

257
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.254
<v Speaker 1>Nema Wedgewood.</v>

258
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.091
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

259
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:13.610
<v Speaker 1>when he brought up the subject of marrying and uh,</v>

260
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.850
<v Speaker 1>his father warned that she came from a very strict family,</v>

261
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Amma would never consider Darwin's theories as anything but heresy deeply in</v>

262
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:21.441
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

263
00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Though Darwin ignored his father's advice to curtail the romance.</v>

264
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.580
<v Speaker 1>He mentioned some of his notions regarding religion in nature to Emma.</v>

265
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.900
<v Speaker 1>It was surprisingly understanding Darwin juggled numerous tasks from writing</v>

266
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:37.880
<v Speaker 1>books to studying more fossils to watching apes and hangs at the London Zoo as</v>

267
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:38.300
<v Speaker 1>he works.</v>

268
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.250
<v Speaker 1>He also continued his relationship with Emma.</v>

269
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You proposed to her on November the 11th,</v>

270
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:43.160
<v Speaker 1>1838.</v>

271
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.400
<v Speaker 1>The proposal was well received by both sides of family.</v>

272
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Arrangements were made for Darwin to receive a handsome annual sum of money from</v>

273
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:51.164
<v Speaker 1>his father.</v>

274
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>This would allow the couple to live while Darwin continued retaining Covington</v>

275
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:56.230
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

276
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Since research on his theory of evolution was still incomplete,</v>

277
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>jaws and Emma were married on January the 29th,</v>

278
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 1>1839 the couple of settles into her home in London,</v>

279
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>which was already filled with scientific material.</v>

280
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

281
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Covington left Darwin's employment to make his own fortune.</v>

282
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>He was replaced by a man named Joseph Pass Layer.</v>

283
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>During the spring of 1839 Darwin carried out research.</v>

284
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:18.364
<v Speaker 1>I'm crossbreeding.</v>

285
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>He asked various experts,</v>

286
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>including farmers questions about how they crossbred their animals.</v>

287
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>He filled page off the page with his correspondences in May.</v>

288
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>The multivolume collection he wrote with Captain Fitzroy narrative of the</v>

289
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>surveying voyages of the HMS Beagle was finally released to the public.</v>

290
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 1>This celebration of the beagles voyage,</v>

291
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>it became a best seller.</v>

292
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Charles was now a respected scientist and author and as a member of the royal</v>

293
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:42.154
<v Speaker 1>society</v>

294
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>during the 1814 and 1850 stolen,</v>

295
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.480
<v Speaker 1>continued his research and writing.</v>

296
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>In 1842 he wrote a geology book entitled the structure and distribution of coral</v>

297
00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>reefs with two more geology books following in the next few years.</v>

298
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.253
<v Speaker 1>As time went on,</v>

299
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.880
<v Speaker 1>his health began to fail.</v>

300
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.610
<v Speaker 1>He could only do a few hours of work each day.</v>

301
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.360
<v Speaker 1>His illness,</v>

302
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.410
<v Speaker 1>it was never identifies,</v>

303
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.290
<v Speaker 1>but it could have been the after effects of his tropical sickness.</v>

304
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.910
<v Speaker 1>While on his five year voyage.</v>

305
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Despite his illness,</v>

306
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.250
<v Speaker 1>he continued his research.</v>

307
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea of evolution,</v>

308
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.350
<v Speaker 1>he was becoming more and more convinced that species we're not fixed and</v>

309
00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:19.184
<v Speaker 1>immutable.</v>

310
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.690
<v Speaker 1>He had written a short version of his ideas in 1842 but decided to collect every</v>

311
00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 1>scrap of information he could and write a lengthy book with masses of evidence</v>

312
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>for his theory.</v>

313
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.870
<v Speaker 1>For many years,</v>

314
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was reluctance to publish his ideas on evolution by natural selection.</v>

315
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.760
<v Speaker 1>It's meant that animals and plants evolved naturally.</v>

316
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.460
<v Speaker 1>He now believed that God have not created them.</v>

317
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.180
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

318
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Speaker 1>most people at the time,</v>

319
00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:43.940
<v Speaker 1>including many scientists,</v>

320
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.220
<v Speaker 1>still believed in the truth of the Bible.</v>

321
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.420
<v Speaker 1>He knew that speaking out against the accepted teachings of the Bible was set</v>

322
00:13:50.421 --> 00:13:53.660
<v Speaker 1>into a fence and cause a storm of protest.</v>

323
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Darwin may have never finished his work on evolution,</v>

324
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:05.100
<v Speaker 1>but for a letter which arrived at his home in Kent in June,</v>

325
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.970
<v Speaker 1>1885 from Malaysia,</v>

326
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it was from another English naturalist,</v>

327
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Wallace.</v>

328
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Wallace knew that Darwin was interested in evolution.</v>

329
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So with his letter he sent his summary of the theory.</v>

330
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Darwin was amazed.</v>

331
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.040
<v Speaker 1>All of the work he had so patiently done over the last 20 years was neatly</v>

332
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:24.540
<v Speaker 1>described by Wallace as a scientific meeting at the nae and society in London.</v>

333
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.370
<v Speaker 1>The works of both Wallace and Darwin were read outs in July of 1858 after that</v>

334
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.580
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

335
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it's agreed the Darwin who had gathered far more evidence to support their joint</v>

336
00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:37.740
<v Speaker 1>theory should carry on with the idea while he stood aside to Olin did say weekly</v>

337
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.060
<v Speaker 1>finishing his great book.</v>

338
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It was published on the 24th of November,</v>

339
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.970
<v Speaker 1>1859 and it was called the origin of species.</v>

340
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.350
<v Speaker 1>The publisher of Darwin's book,</v>

341
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:50.790
<v Speaker 1>John Mary Reddit's before printing it and realized a great outcry would follow.</v>

342
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

343
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>he only printed 1,250 copies.</v>

344
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.330
<v Speaker 1>These sold out almost at once and a second edition was quickly produced.</v>

345
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.343
<v Speaker 1>They've all,</v>

346
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 1>they were indeed outraged.</v>

347
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Darwin one's denying the truth that was in the Bible scientists and lined up to</v>

348
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>have their say with many criticizing Darwin.</v>

349
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 1>One clergymen cools,</v>

350
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:09.590
<v Speaker 1>the quiet,</v>

351
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 1>mild mannered Darwin,</v>

352
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous man in England,</v>

353
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 1>but others quickly recognized the good signs in Darwin as ideas and to the vast</v>

354
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 1>amount of evidence which supported them.</v>

355
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The biologist Thomas Huxley spoke for him in England while professor of botany</v>

356
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 1>at Harvard University,</v>

357
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.530
<v Speaker 1>a sick gray it.</v>

358
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It's great supporter in North America.</v>

359
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Darwin himself stayed in camps and took little part in the arguments.</v>

360
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>So now the question arises,</v>

361
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:34.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

362
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>what did Darwin actually postulate in his famous book?</v>

363
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:38.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

364
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 1>the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of</v>

365
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 1>favored races in the struggle for life is a long but very readable book.</v>

366
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.850
<v Speaker 1>It begins by looking at variation under domestication,</v>

367
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 1>including pigeons,</v>

368
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:51.321
<v Speaker 1>horses,</v>

369
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>and garden flowers.</v>

370
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Then it covers variation in nature and the problems of identifying a species.</v>

371
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.830
<v Speaker 1>It shows how the offspring of parents are all similar but slightly different.</v>

372
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 1>These slight differences might give an individual a better chance of succeeding</v>

373
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and staying alive.</v>

374
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Laser chapters deal with animal instincts,</v>

375
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>fossils,</v>

376
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>and the geographical and manner of animals and plants from mice to elephants.</v>

377
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Yet.</v>

378
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 1>He never explains the origin of any one species.</v>

379
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.160
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned,</v>

380
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 1>the origin of species,</v>

381
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 1>sharks and angered many people including Darwin own family to accept the theory</v>

382
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 1>of evolution meant accepting that the accounts in the Bible of creation of</v>

383
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:31.220
<v Speaker 1>animal and plant species could not be true.</v>

384
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Many scientists,</v>

385
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>they simply struggles to believe in both gradually.</v>

386
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

387
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the theory of evolution by natural selection gained grounds and most scientists</v>

388
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 1>came to believe that Darwin was right Darwin,</v>

389
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 1>he did not retire after the origin of species was published.</v>

390
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.010
<v Speaker 1>He kept up his studies and researchers and carried on with his experiments and</v>

391
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 1>nature observations.</v>

392
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 1>In 1871 he published descent of man then selection in relation to sex.</v>

393
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>In this work,</v>

394
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.540
<v Speaker 1>he concluded that humans are not the result of special creation,</v>

395
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.450
<v Speaker 1>but that they have evolved along with other animals.</v>

396
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Their ancestors could indeed be traced back far into prehistory.</v>

397
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>In the 1870s Darwin's health improved and in 1877 he was awarded a special</v>

398
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>degree by Cambridge University.</v>

399
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 1>He continued to write books about insect eating plants,</v>

400
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>how plants grow and move,</v>

401
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and how they encourage decay and enrich the soil with Descente huge success as</v>

402
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:22.731
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

403
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Darwin divided his time between revising the two works.</v>

404
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 1>In April of 1874 he completed work on descents second edition.</v>

405
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.300
<v Speaker 1>This was the last time he wrote about evolution between projects and illnesses.</v>

406
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Darwin continued to refine his work a decade after its first publication.</v>

407
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 1>The fifth edition of origin was released.</v>

408
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.850
<v Speaker 1>The sixth edition published in 1871 use the word evolution for the first time</v>

409
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>after a mild heart attack in December of 1881 Charles Darwin died several months</v>

410
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.030
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

411
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 1>peacefully at down house.</v>

412
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>His home of Nettie 50 years.</v>

413
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 1>He was 73 years old.</v>

414
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

415
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the storm of protests over the origin of species had died away and Darwin had</v>

416
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 1>become a national figure and one of the best known scientific names of all time.</v>

417
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>It was laid to rest at Westminster Abbey London next to the Great Isaac Newton.</v>

418
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 1>The funeral was attended by dozens of politicians,</v>

419
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 1>inventors,</v>
