<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:10.840

7
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo da Vinci was a genius who invented revolutionary ideas centuries before</v>

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world would catch up with him.</v>

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>He embodies the definition of a renaissance man,</v>

10
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>one who studied and mastered a variety of different subjects.</v>

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.323
<v Speaker 1>He was a painter,</v>

12
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.991
<v Speaker 1>an engineer,</v>

13
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>or an architect or right,</v>

14
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 1>or a scientist and an invents up.</v>

15
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>While you may know him for his most famous works like the Mona Lisa or the last</v>

16
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>supper,</v>

17
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>few people know the man behind the paintings.</v>

18
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Today on biographics,</v>

19
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>we're telling you all about the anodic Da Vinci.</v>

20
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>My baby boy named Leonardo was born on April the 15 1452 and a Tuscan village</v>

21
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>called Vinci.</v>

22
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>The child was born out of wedlock to a wealthy legal notary named mess-up,</v>

23
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>yarrow,</v>

24
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Fru Senio to Antonio and to beautiful peasant girl named Catarina Dimio lippy.</v>

25
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>His father took responsibility for the boy and raised him on the family,</v>

26
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>a stage with his wife,</v>

27
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>but as a bastard child,</v>

28
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>a young Leonardo was not even allowed to be given his father's last name.</v>

29
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>He was simply called the NR Two da Vinci,</v>

30
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>which means Leonardo Da Vinci lived with his biological mother and son.</v>

31
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>He was five years old when his father took over the responsibility of raising</v>

32
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

33
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Casuarina went on to marry a man who was simply referred to as the fight up.</v>

34
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo's father Massa and married a 16 year old Nobel girl named Al Barrier</v>

35
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:44.301
<v Speaker 1>Ends.</v>

36
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>They have legitimate children of their own.</v>

37
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going to school,</v>

38
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the country signed was young Leonardo's classroom.</v>

39
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Even as a young age,</v>

40
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>he was inquisitive and he truly fell in love with nature.</v>

41
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>He wished that men could fly like the birds and swim through the oceans like the</v>

42
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

43
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Together with his brothers,</v>

44
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:06.851
<v Speaker 1>they played games of war and he imagines being triumphant in battle like the men</v>

45
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>and the stories that were told by his father.</v>

46
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.101
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

47
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>this stage of innocence,</v>

48
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't last forever.</v>

49
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>As he grew up in the NRD learns that he would not be allowed to inherit the</v>

50
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.694
<v Speaker 1>family estate.</v>

51
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] had nine brothers and three sisters,</v>

52
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>so even if he could inherit his father's estate,</v>

53
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's going to be much to go around.</v>

54
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

55
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.971
<v Speaker 1>the Anado hands,</v>

57
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I learn a trade and figure out how to take care of himself.</v>

58
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Now in medieval florins guilds,</v>

59
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>they were sort of like today's trade unions and they were split up into multiple</v>

60
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 1>categories of jobs that a man could choose from.</v>

61
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>So long as he was born into the right social class,</v>

62
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>the highest ranking guilds were called the RTM.</v>

63
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Maggiore and his father would have been a part of the guild for powerful</v>

64
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:48.531
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>

65
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:48.981
<v Speaker 1>judges,</v>

66
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>and notaries,</v>

67
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>but as an illegitimate child,</v>

68
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>this was like being in the lower class and he was not even allowed to join the</v>

69
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] guild categories,</v>

70
00:02:56.691 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>which middle class workers like blacksmiths stonemasons were a part of.</v>

71
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>His only option was to join the guild,</v>

72
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>which held lower cost jobs like beggars and Miller's.</v>

73
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

74
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>they're nodoz father.</v>

75
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>He still wanted his son to have a good life.</v>

76
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Now he could see that the boy had a natural talent for art.</v>

77
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.900
<v Speaker 1>So his father introduced him to a man called Andre at Dell very Archie own.</v>

78
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>He ran an old studio in the city of Florence off to seeing the boys sketches.</v>

79
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>He agreed to take him on as an apprentice.</v>

80
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

81
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Andre Delver Akio had several artists and craftsmen working for him in his</v>

82
00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>workshop.</v>

83
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.100
<v Speaker 1>He would take on commissions from the wealthy and the powerful and the DC family</v>

84
00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and divide the work amongst his students and employees.</v>

85
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Their studio works on improving the beauty of the city.</v>

86
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>They had to work with all mediums,</v>

87
00:03:45.561 --> 00:03:47.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it was carving marble statues,</v>

88
00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Costing Matt a law,</v>

89
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.790
<v Speaker 1>painting portraits,</v>

90
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>even architecture,</v>

91
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 1>bridges and lots of other civil engineering projects were all sketched by</v>

92
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.240
<v Speaker 1>members of their skilled.</v>

93
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.230
<v Speaker 1>So this made it necessary for Leonardo to learn multiple disciplines.</v>

94
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 1>After a few years of training,</v>

95
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:06.731
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Da Vinci assisted Verrocchio and painting a commissions piece for the</v>

96
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church gold,</v>

97
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 1>the baptism of Christ.</v>

98
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 1>This was a very large mural on the wall of a church,</v>

99
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 1>so there was plenty of space for two artists to stands and work on the painting</v>

100
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

101
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Rocky Akio instructed Leonardo depends.</v>

102
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Two angels that had been included in his rough sketch when Da Vinci was done,</v>

103
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Rockiyo was in total shock.</v>

104
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He could not believe how gorgeous and lifeline because the painting was.</v>

105
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.880
<v Speaker 1>He knew that the students had already surpassed the master.</v>

106
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.020
<v Speaker 1>By his mid Twenties Leonardo Da Vinci became a master artist at [inaudible]</v>

107
00:04:36.021 --> 00:04:38.090
<v Speaker 1>studio and Deon himself a reputation.</v>

108
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll do conducted a lot of experiments with arts like studying how like</v>

109
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.400
<v Speaker 1>change the shading on an object or the perfect time of data sketch someone's</v>

110
00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:47.120
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

111
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>However his talents,</v>

112
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 1>it was also a curse because it caused a lot of jealousy among the art community.</v>

113
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.110
<v Speaker 1>At 24 years old,</v>

114
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci was accused of having sex with a male prostitute and he was arrested</v>

115
00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:58.730
<v Speaker 1>for sodomy.</v>

116
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.271
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

117
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the punishment for Saul to me was being burned to death,</v>

118
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 1>but when he went to trial,</v>

119
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 1>no evidence was presented and no witnesses came forward and they simply could</v>

120
00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:10.220
<v Speaker 1>not prove that had done anything illegal,</v>

121
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.480
<v Speaker 1>so they had to let him go.</v>

122
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.200
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

123
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>even though he was found not guilty,</v>

124
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>still wrote in his journals that this scandal very seriously hurt.</v>

125
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 1>His reputation for Yukon's wanted to work with them in forums despite his</v>

126
00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:22.490
<v Speaker 1>obvious talent.</v>

127
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know Da Vinci's actual sexual orientation.</v>

128
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:27.530
<v Speaker 1>We only know that he never got married.</v>

129
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Some believe that he chose to be celebrated in order to focus on his work.</v>

130
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.083
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

131
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>whoever turned him into the authorities definitely wanted him dead.</v>

132
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 1>As awful as this sounds,</v>

133
00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 1>medieval times,</v>

134
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:42.170
<v Speaker 1>they were truly cut throat and none of high standing always had to watch their</v>

135
00:05:42.171 --> 00:05:46.250
<v Speaker 1>backs to make sure they were not killed by their enemies and assassin named</v>

136
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Bernardo demand.</v>

137
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Dino Baron and Jelly stabby on her demo DG in the streets simply because they</v>

138
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 1>were both from rival banking families.</v>

139
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 1>One of Leonardo's earliest known sketches was his observation of Marin Shelley's</v>

140
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.314
<v Speaker 1>body and the,</v>

141
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>and it was titled the hanged man.</v>

142
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Often with this dispute between the Baron cellies and the [inaudible] families</v>

143
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Florence in Naples,</v>

144
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>they were on the brink of war,</v>

145
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>the men in Da Vinci's gills.</v>

146
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>They were forced to stop working on art and to use their engineering skills to</v>

147
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>defend the city.</v>

148
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Since da Vinci was a bastard,</v>

149
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>he could not become a knight and serve in the role court.</v>

150
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

151
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>he started to design ladders and massive weapons to help defend the Florence</v>

152
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>should they ever need it.</v>

153
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps he saw this as his way to be remembered in the history books.</v>

154
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>During the three month time period,</v>

155
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>the city was on edge believing they were on the brink of war.</v>

156
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>When Lorenzo muddy tree roots islands off often making a successful peace</v>

157
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:35.420
<v Speaker 1>treaty.</v>

158
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.150
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the city celebrated but Leonardo,</v>

159
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>he was actually disappointed.</v>

160
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 1>After peace returned to the city,</v>

161
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>the artist's skills could go back to making beautiful things,</v>

162
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but this was no longer challenging or interesting to Vinci.</v>

163
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>When he was 29 years old,</v>

164
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>he was asked to do his first commissioned the mural as a church all by himself.</v>

165
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>The painting was called adoration of the Magi Ans he took his concept above and</v>

166
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>beyond what any other painter had done previously.</v>

167
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>It was an incredible piece,</v>

168
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>But da Vinci didn't seem to see that because it's off to spending a very long</v>

169
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 1>time working on the piece.</v>

170
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>He decided that he simply could not finish the painting.</v>

171
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>He was very restless at that time and he didn't have the patience to actually</v>

172
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>sit and complete a lot of his projects.</v>

173
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>He had so many brilliant ideas,</v>

174
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but he sometimes had trouble executing on them.</v>

175
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci was actually sued more than one,</v>

176
00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>so getting paid by a patron that then failing to finish the work as he promised.</v>

177
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>This couples with the accusation of sodomy meant that his talents who is simply</v>

178
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>not enough to make up for his bad reputation.</v>

179
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You thought that now maybe it was the time to start over some way.</v>

180
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.830
<v Speaker 1>New.</v>

181
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Now just before we get into Da Vinci's new stage of life,</v>

182
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I do want to quickly tell you about brilliance.</v>

183
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't promise you that they'll turn you into the next Da Vinci,</v>

184
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>but I can promise you that brilliant will improve your understanding of what he</v>

185
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.650
<v Speaker 1>and the other great scientists have done.</v>

186
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant science learning platform that allow you to learn through something</v>

187
00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>called active learning,</v>

188
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>which sums up is basically the opposite of that feeling of reading a really</v>

189
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>complex paragraph about some principal and then having no idea what on earth</v>

190
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about.</v>

191
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Even if you've read it a dozen times and it's not just the basics.</v>

192
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:12.950
<v Speaker 1>That brilliant cover though,</v>

193
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>they totally covered the basics as well.</v>

194
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 1>They go all the way through to things like complex statistics and a whole lot</v>

195
00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

196
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Whether you want to like Da Vinci,</v>

197
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>look at some classical mechanics or maybe you want to jump ahead just a few</v>

198
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>years and look at special relativity or quantum objects.</v>

199
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.341
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

200
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Makes even the most complex concepts,</v>

201
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 1>easy to understand.</v>

202
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>They give you something super short to read.</v>

203
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just a few lines.</v>

204
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to get through and then you immediately apply what you just</v>

205
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:38.721
<v Speaker 1>learned to a problem.</v>

206
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>You simply rinse and repeat that and suddenly,</v>

207
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>or understanding a whole bunch of stuff that you didn't think you would be.</v>

208
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been using brilliant and I think you should go try it out just to see how</v>

209
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>fascinated is for such a complex subject to be so easily grasped.</v>

210
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You can support biographics beginnings,</v>

211
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>a brilliant.org forward slash biographics unless get back to Da Vinci.</v>

212
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Even though he was more talented than many of the other painters in Florence,</v>

213
00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo da Vinci still went through a midlife crisis when he was 30 years old.</v>

214
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.280
<v Speaker 1>He realized that the lifestyle of a professional artist,</v>

215
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:17.600
<v Speaker 1>it did not suit him and he craved the adventure of having a career in web and</v>

216
00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:18.290
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>

217
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.460
<v Speaker 1>He had an entire book filled with incredible inventions that would not be made</v>

218
00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>until years later.</v>

219
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.870
<v Speaker 1>This included things like a tanker,</v>

220
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.870
<v Speaker 1>giant crossbow,</v>

221
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:28.010
<v Speaker 1>underwater scuba gear,</v>

222
00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:30.080
<v Speaker 1>and even a robotic soldier.</v>

223
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.020
<v Speaker 1>He was truly a hundreds of years ahead of his time,</v>

224
00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:35.140
<v Speaker 1>but without a war of these weapons,</v>

225
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.070
<v Speaker 1>they never actually came to life.</v>

226
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Da Vinci,</v>

227
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.680
<v Speaker 1>you plan to move to Milan,</v>

228
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the most northern Italian status.</v>

229
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.200
<v Speaker 1>He also wanted to secure employment before he made that Johnny.</v>

230
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So we know why he wants us to leave Florence,</v>

231
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:48.830
<v Speaker 1>but why did he choose Milan?</v>

232
00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:48.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

233
00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:50.810
<v Speaker 1>that's because the city was much closer to France,</v>

234
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:54.350
<v Speaker 1>so there were far more interested in gathering weapons to defend the country.</v>

235
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci sends a lesser to the Duke of Milan,</v>

236
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:59.170
<v Speaker 1>claiming that he was a weapon design expert.</v>

237
00:09:59.171 --> 00:10:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And the included a few pages from his sketch book.</v>

238
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 1>At the very ends of the letter,</v>

239
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>he also included a single line mentioning that he was also a painter.</v>

240
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.470
<v Speaker 1>This [inaudible] Vico sportster,</v>

241
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>the temporary Duke of Milan.</v>

242
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.140
<v Speaker 1>He was holding this position of power in Zilla.</v>

243
00:10:12.141 --> 00:10:13.520
<v Speaker 1>His nephew came of age.</v>

244
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.920
<v Speaker 1>This faults family had not been in power for very long,</v>

245
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:18.050
<v Speaker 1>especially compared to the likes of the muddy cheese.</v>

246
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.460
<v Speaker 1>So volt's a invited Leonardo Da Vinci to visit and he was overjoyed,</v>

247
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 1>hoping that he would finally be able to make that career change that he wanted.</v>

248
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.411
<v Speaker 1>But once he got there,</v>

249
00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:30.620
<v Speaker 1>he was gravely disappointed to find out that the Duke wanted him to paint a</v>

250
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:33.020
<v Speaker 1>portrait of his beautiful mistress today,</v>

251
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:35.120
<v Speaker 1>that Boucher discord lady with an Amen.</v>

252
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Even though he came to Milan to escape being a painter,</v>

253
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.300
<v Speaker 1>he's still blew people away with his talents.</v>

254
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.480
<v Speaker 1>So also was so impressed that he commissioned a statue of a 24 foot tall horse.</v>

255
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci told him that it would take at least three years to complete.</v>

256
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.451
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

257
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:50.661
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

258
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci was stalling for time because without the help of his old master</v>

259
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>studio,</v>

260
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.510
<v Speaker 1>he had no idea how it was going to pull off a 20 foot tall metal cost horse.</v>

261
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.463
<v Speaker 1>There's divorces.</v>

262
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.280
<v Speaker 1>They were establishing themselves and the Duke of Milan believed that paying for</v>

263
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:08.540
<v Speaker 1>things like metal statues would somehow prove that permanence in high society.</v>

264
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>

265
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci created the horse out of clay and it was unveiled at a party.</v>

266
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.360
<v Speaker 1>It's impressed them so much that Da Vinci was accepted into this falls or royal</v>

267
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:18.110
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

268
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

269
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.030
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of his projects,</v>

270
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci,</v>

271
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 1>while I was in a bit over his head and he was running out of time by a stroke of</v>

272
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 1>luck sports or decided to go to war and they needed the metal resources for his</v>

273
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:29.540
<v Speaker 1>armies weapons.</v>

274
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.231
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

275
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Da Vinci fault that this,</v>

276
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:36.680
<v Speaker 1>this might be the time that he can shine with his weapons buff that were not</v>

277
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.840
<v Speaker 1>enough resources to pay for that creation.</v>

278
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.260
<v Speaker 1>The Duke of Milan gave him her new assignment in decorating a church called</v>

279
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Santa Maria del Grad Ceo,</v>

280
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:46.550
<v Speaker 1>which is where he painted one of his most famous works.</v>

281
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.260
<v Speaker 1>The last suffered at the time.</v>

282
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.100
<v Speaker 1>The priests were actually very annoyed with him because it took him over three</v>

283
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>years to the painting for the next 17 years,</v>

284
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:55.961
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci,</v>

285
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 1>android,</v>

286
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.820
<v Speaker 1>a life of financial security and respect and his forces royal court.</v>

287
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>During the time that he lived in Milan da Vinci at a secret projects this,</v>

288
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 1>he never dared to tell anyone.</v>

289
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 1>He was dissecting human cadavers and sketching their bodies,</v>

290
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>muscles and organs.</v>

291
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>He also made a wax costs of the organs.</v>

292
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Now this all sounds rather creepy and Da Vinci knew this,</v>

293
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 1>which is why he kept this sketchbook a secrets,</v>

294
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 1>and it only showed up in the 16 hundreds at that time,</v>

295
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>autopsies and any other form of disturbing the dead was frowned upon by the</v>

296
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church.</v>

297
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Speaker 1>You already knew what it was like to have a solid reputation back in Florence,</v>

298
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 1>so he was far more careful this time,</v>

299
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>essentially leading a double life,</v>

300
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 1>even though his sketchbook was found over a hundred years later,</v>

301
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>his studies of the human body,</v>

302
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 1>they were revolutionary and became the foundation of modern anatomy.</v>

303
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll do da Vinci would Ronnie's in notebooks about his scientific</v>

304
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:48.131
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>

305
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>his inventions and autistic ideas that are of a 15,000 pages.</v>

306
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It was notes that have survived.</v>

307
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Even wrote some of those notes backwards so you could,</v>

308
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>and you read them when looking in a mirror.</v>

309
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that he did this because he was worried that people would</v>

310
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:02.860
<v Speaker 1>steal his ideas.</v>

311
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.180
<v Speaker 1>When Leonardo Da Vinci was 50 years old,</v>

312
00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:15.050
<v Speaker 1>this falls or family lost their position of power and the French invaded Milan.</v>

313
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>When they saw the giants play horse statue of standing on the stage.</v>

314
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.540
<v Speaker 1>They used it for Tanya practice.</v>

315
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll do da Vinci.</v>

316
00:13:21.591 --> 00:13:25.040
<v Speaker 1>He had to leave Milan with the bare necessities including his journals,</v>

317
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:26.990
<v Speaker 1>but he left all of his works of art behind.</v>

318
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 1>He decided to travel from place to place once again,</v>

319
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to pitch us ideas for military weaponry around Italy.</v>

320
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.310
<v Speaker 1>He showed the Duke of Venice is ideas which included a snorkeling suit for</v>

321
00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:39.650
<v Speaker 1>breathing underwater that actually worked.</v>

322
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:44.630
<v Speaker 1>He had ideas on how humans could fly or walk on the bottom of the ocean given</v>

323
00:13:44.631 --> 00:13:45.120
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

324
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.610
<v Speaker 1>This was at a time when people didn't even have clocks or watches to tell time.</v>

325
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.740
<v Speaker 1>While all of his ideas were amazing,</v>

326
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.850
<v Speaker 1>they were far too ahead of his time and the Duke of Venice didn't find any need</v>

327
00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:56.930
<v Speaker 1>for these inventions.</v>

328
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci.</v>

329
00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 1>He was forced to reluctantly move back to Florence.</v>

330
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Speaker 1>He was reluctant because if they're that everyone would still remember his bad</v>

331
00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:04.670
<v Speaker 1>reputation,</v>

332
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.400
<v Speaker 1>but it was actually far worse than that.</v>

333
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.353
<v Speaker 1>By that time,</v>

334
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.590
<v Speaker 1>the people had forgotten all about the name Leonardo Da Vinci and there was a</v>

335
00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:13.760
<v Speaker 1>new genius in town,</v>

336
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo,</v>

337
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and he was just 26 years old.</v>

338
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.370
<v Speaker 1>Since the art world in Florence was so competitive,</v>

339
00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo hated Michelangelo almost immediately.</v>

340
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci was clearly jealous and had to find reasons to dislike Michelangelo.</v>

341
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.190
<v Speaker 1>He would rights angrily in his journal about how he thought the young man was</v>

342
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.960
<v Speaker 1>dirty and undignified.</v>

343
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.650
<v Speaker 1>This is why the long there do you see in most depictions of Da Vinci actually</v>

344
00:14:36.651 --> 00:14:40.760
<v Speaker 1>spent all of his younger years making sure that he was always clean shaven and</v>

345
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>you're always wore the finest of clothes.</v>

346
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.550
<v Speaker 1>He even had professional musicians playing music for his clients while they sat</v>

347
00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:48.680
<v Speaker 1>for their portraits and the whole process.</v>

348
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of like going to a luxury spa.</v>

349
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo on the other hands,</v>

350
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.590
<v Speaker 1>he had the polar opposite approach to his art.</v>

351
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>He was so focused on his work that he would forget to shave for days and that</v>

352
00:14:58.851 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>his beard grow out.</v>

353
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>You less chips of stone and dust cover his home after working on a statue and it</v>

354
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>was far more like a workshop than a comfortable place for clients to stay.</v>

355
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.740
<v Speaker 1>The two artists,</v>

356
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 1>they deeply disliked each other and even once got into a fight in public</v>

357
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 1>secretly Da Vinci would go home to write about how depressed he was to be</v>

358
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 1>getting older as well as writing about the fear and anxiety that ruled his</v>

359
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:22.844
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

360
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Since da Vinci could no longer secure his place in the foreign science scene,</v>

361
00:15:31.711 --> 00:15:34.590
<v Speaker 1>he decided to try his luck at weapon design.</v>

362
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.880
<v Speaker 1>One last time,</v>

363
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Pope Alexander had a bastard son named Cesari board job.</v>

364
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Some people say that he was aggrieved leader while others see the Bordeaux was a</v>

365
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:43.770
<v Speaker 1>bloodthirsty really who kills his,</v>

366
00:15:43.771 --> 00:15:44.101
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

367
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:44.934
<v Speaker 1>He got in his way,</v>

368
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli his famous book called the prince was even based on border as an</v>

369
00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:51.930
<v Speaker 1>example of what a ruler must do in order to stay in power.</v>

370
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci centers,</v>

371
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.520
<v Speaker 1>sketches to border and finally here and someone saying yes to his weapons.</v>

372
00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.630
<v Speaker 1>He became chief general engineer for board and supervise the construction of</v>

373
00:16:00.631 --> 00:16:01.171
<v Speaker 1>towers,</v>

374
00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:05.220
<v Speaker 1>weapons and Birdseye view maps of the cities which she plans on invading,</v>

375
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.170
<v Speaker 1>which was revolutionary for the time.</v>

376
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci got everything that he wanted,</v>

377
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was at a price he never expected.</v>

378
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.240
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why Borgia was willing to pay for the creation of all these</v>

379
00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:19.560
<v Speaker 1>weapons was because he wanted to kill as many enemies as possible until this</v>

380
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:19.831
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

381
00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:24.690
<v Speaker 1>The idea of war and Sydney being just a concept to Leonardo Da Vinci and stories</v>

382
00:16:24.691 --> 00:16:26.070
<v Speaker 1>of nights going into battle.</v>

383
00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:27.270
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like fun.</v>

384
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.650
<v Speaker 1>For the first time in his life,</v>

385
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Da Vinci actually witnessed what a blood festy battle looked like and it was too</v>

386
00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:34.710
<v Speaker 1>gruesome for him to handle.</v>

387
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.700
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>

388
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.680
<v Speaker 1>truly man is more savage than beast for our brutality exceeds theirs.</v>

389
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.110
<v Speaker 1>We live by the death of others.</v>

390
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.890
<v Speaker 1>The straw that broke the camel's back was when Borgia ordered the death of one</v>

391
00:16:46.891 --> 00:16:48.240
<v Speaker 1>of Da Vinci's close friends.</v>

392
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.620
<v Speaker 1>He quietly left border in the dead of the night and moved back to Florence where</v>

393
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.620
<v Speaker 1>he returns to a peaceful life painting portraits.</v>

394
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 1>After selling those weapons,</v>

395
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Da Vinci had saved a nice nest egg for his retirement and it was during</v>

396
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>this time that he painted the Mona Lisa.</v>

397
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 1>No one knows for sure who she actually is.</v>

398
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>There are several theories,</v>

399
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>but none have been confirmed.</v>

400
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Unlike all those portraits that were commissions and given away,</v>

401
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>he carried the portrait of Mona Lisa with him for the rest of his life.</v>

402
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.491
<v Speaker 1>For once,</v>

403
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:24.890
<v Speaker 1>this was a piece of art that was done just for him,</v>

404
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 1>but he was constantly changing it because he never felt he got it exactly right.</v>

405
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>During his retirement,</v>

406
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:34.940
<v Speaker 1>he started to build massive wings for human buildings in the hopes that one day</v>

407
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 1>people would fly.</v>

408
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:36.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

409
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.300
<v Speaker 1>there will be wings for man.</v>

410
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>If it is not accomplished by me,</v>

411
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 1>it will be accomplished someday by some other.</v>

412
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>There is a commonly told story that during a flight attempt with these wings,</v>

413
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>someone fell and broke their leg after this failed attempt.</v>

414
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>He designed a motor that would flap the wings,</v>

415
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but it never worked properly.</v>

416
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.480
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

417
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 1>he did eventually designed the first wing that looks very much like what we use</v>

418
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.980
<v Speaker 1>in modern day airplanes besides the patrons that he served,</v>

419
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Da Vinci was not.</v>

420
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 1>He had a famous around the world.</v>

421
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 1>He intended to publish books,</v>

422
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but he never actually went through with us.</v>

423
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned Dahlia,</v>

424
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 1>he wrote and sketched over 15,000 pages on a variety of subjects,</v>

425
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 1>but he was a perfectionist,</v>

426
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>so he continued to add more and more information because he never felt that his</v>

427
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 1>work was complete.</v>

428
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Among these notes are multiple sketches of an old man with a beard.</v>

429
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll assume that this was his self portrait,</v>

430
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 1>but no one knows for sure.</v>

431
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.260
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

432
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 1>this image is used to portray him in popular culture and it's how he is</v>

433
00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 1>remembered today.</v>

434
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.141
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

435
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:34.771
<v Speaker 1>King Frances,</v>

436
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 1>the first of France had been collecting Da Vinci's pieces for years since he</v>

437
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 1>wrote a letter to Da Vinci inviting him to live in his Chateau de Vinci.</v>

438
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>He agreed to move to France when he was 65 years old.</v>

439
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.691
<v Speaker 1>He had a stroke,</v>

440
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:47.820
<v Speaker 1>which paralyzed is on the king's castle,</v>

441
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 1>became his comfortable retirement place,</v>

442
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 1>and he was given the very best medical cath and money could buy.</v>

443
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 1>When he died in the year 1519 he left the Mona Lisa rent all of his sketch books</v>

444
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>and journals to his law and apprentice born a bastard,</v>

445
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo da Vinci,</v>

446
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Speaker 1>died like a king.</v>

447
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>His life lives on forever and as well,</v>

448
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I continue.</v>
