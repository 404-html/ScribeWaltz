00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.480
When you think of Nazi Germany and most likely think about the human rights

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.630
abuses and the concentration camps like Auschwitz,

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.770
but have you ever wondered what happened to the black people who lived under the

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:11.604
Third Reich?

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.570
It turns out that even though there were racial laws demanding the extermination

6
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.130
of the Jewish and the Roma people,

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.940
there were so few Africans living in Germany that they were not really

8
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.920
considered to be on of Hitler's main priorities.
One very special mixed race boy,

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.730
he grew up in Germany during the Third Reich.
Kinsey lived to tell the tale.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.100
Not only did he manage to survive unscathed,

11
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:35.040
but he also desperately wanted to join the Nazi party.

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
He was an actual print since he grew up to become a writer.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.070
This is the incredible story of Hums.
Massapequa.

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.060
<v 0>Han's Juergen Massaquoi was born in Hamburg,</v>

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.740
Germany in 1926 but he didn't look like most of the blond haired and blue eyed

17
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:03.920
baby is born into the country.
His mother,

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.080
birth of Bates was a German nurse and his father are harsh.

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.060
Massaquoi was the prince of the African country of Liberia.
One harms was born.

20
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.600
I'll hodge was a law student studying at Trinity College in Dublin.

21
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.890
The plan was for birth or indoor hodge to get married after graduation and she

22
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.440
lived with her future father in law came Mama Lu.

23
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.620
The king received his college education in the United States and became the

24
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.770
first ethnically African diplomat to live and work in Germany.

25
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.690
Liberia has elected a president,

26
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.090
so while the position of king was still a powerful one,

27
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.970
he was more of a figurehead for the tribal leadership.
For years,

28
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.510
King Mama Lu had lived with five wives,
which was a tribal tradition,

29
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
but he gave up that lifestyle in favor of a more western way of life and married

30
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:45.330
a woman named a Rachel Johnson.

31
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.200
They had several children together and they accepted birther on hands into their

32
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.880
happy home,
but at that time,

33
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.360
the only other mixed race children living in Germany will called the Rhineland

34
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:58.440
busters.
In 1919 western Germany was occupied by the allies,

35
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.420
which included African French soldiers.

36
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.110
The German women fought that these men were exciting and exotic and as many of

37
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:06.570
them had affairs with the African soldiers.
However,

38
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.100
after the soldiers left Germany,

39
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.180
many of the women were left pregnant since they gave birth to mixed race babies.

40
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.560
People were shocked since racist Germans were disgusted that women would ever do

41
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:16.980
this.

42
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.160
Many of these mothers could not handle raising the children alone and they were

43
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:22.410
called whores for having these affairs.

44
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.370
Children were given up for adoption and it's the government's spread propaganda

45
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.170
depicting black men is rapists.

46
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.490
These children were seen as the product of foreign brutality.
However,

47
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.180
only one woman out of the hundreds of mothers to mixed race children ever came

48
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.300
forward to claim that she had been raped by a black soldier.

49
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:44.040
While the rest said that that had a consensual romantic relationship and the

50
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.910
1920s Germany's economy,
it was struggling to recover from World War One.

51
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
The mass of family were royalty and they were wealthy and exotic.

52
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.470
This made them well-respected in the city of Hamburg and they were treated by

53
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:57.330
everyone as esteemed guests.

54
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.000
Bertha bees has got to experience living with this royal treatment and she was

55
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.300
prepared to move to Liberia,
to get married and have a new life.

56
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.950
As an African princess,
unfortunately are harsh.

57
00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:10.090
Abandons Beth around Houghtons and he never returned to Germany.

58
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.190
King Mama Lu was furious with his son and he threatened to force our harsh to

59
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:17.800
marry birther that she did not want that moment who agreed to continue to

60
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.910
support a birther runs his grandson in the consulate mansion in Hamburg for as

61
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.280
long as possible when he was very young,

62
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:26.980
Hahn's believed that black people were the superior race.

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.890
His family was wealthy and most of the German people,

64
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.300
they were poor by comparison.

65
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.980
They also had several maids and servants that were all white.
On top of that,

66
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.710
Beth is friends which fuss over him as a toddler.

67
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.510
His compliment his skin whenever he went by Han's never met his father and Pesan

68
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.220
only communicated with him through letters because of this.

69
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:48.760
His grandfather stepped in to help raise him and he grew up having a very happy

70
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.350
childhood when he was seven years old,

71
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.650
king [inaudible] who was asked by the president of Liberia to return to his home

72
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:57.340
country and his duty as the gem and consulates when it was [inaudible].

73
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.220
He offered to bring a Hamza and birth that's he live with him in Liberia,

74
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:03.880
but she refused to leave when she knew that I'll hodge didn't want to marry her,

75
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.170
but she was an independent woman and she decided to go back to work as a nurse

76
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.940
and raise.
Hans is a single mum.

77
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.690
They moved into a working class neighborhood in bomb bag where they could only

78
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.430
afford to rent an attic.
Apartment.

79
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.850
Han's became friends with two boys in the neighborhood named at feet and Klaus.

80
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.280
They played together every day.
The three boys,

81
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.070
they were good kids and they got to know many of the people that in their town,

82
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.530
even though he was able to make close friends,

83
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:29.590
homes was bullied by the other boys in school for the color of his skin.

84
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.650
Children would towards in with a racist.
Ryan that is so offensive,

85
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:34.900
we're just not going to repeat it.
In this video,

86
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.650
the children said that his skin was dirty and they said horrible things about

87
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.020
his mother.
Despite all of this bullying,

88
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.590
Hans was incredibly bright and it was one of the smartest kids in the class.

89
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.180
He wants it to be an engineer.

90
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.390
When he grew up and he drew sketches of bridges from a very young age,

91
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.110
his teacher encouraged him to pursue this career even though she secretly

92
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.400
thought that it would not be possible in Nazi occupied Germany when he was seven

93
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.240
years old.
Hamza is babysitters,

94
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.010
so a swastika badge on his sweater so that he could wear it to school.

95
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.550
He wants it to prove to all of his bullies that he wants a German.

96
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.050
Of course it was a child and he didn't fully understands what the Nazi met.

97
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.190
A photographer at the school have snapped a picture of him wearing the swastika.

98
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.660
When Allianz,
his mothers or him wearing his,
when he got home,

99
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.900
she quickly removed the symbol telling him that their family did not believe in

100
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.370
the Nazi party.
However,

101
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.150
like a lot of other kids rebelled against his mother and continued to try to fit

102
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:26.830
in with the rest of the children in the school.

103
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.330
In 1935 when Hans was nine years old,
the Nuremberg laws were passed in Germany,

104
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.560
which made it illegal for Ariens and non Ariens to have sex or get married.

105
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.010
There's included anyone who is not born with pure German blood,

106
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.920
which included Jews remo and of course black people.

107
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.830
Han's Masa Quad was classified as a non Arian.

108
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.600
His mother sheltered him from learning about the Nuremberg laws.

109
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.170
She wanted him to have as normal a childhood as possible.

110
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.660
He could not understand why so many people were being mean to him and see once

111
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.260
to know why he couldn't just be like everyone else.

112
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.750
People would point stare at him in the street and whisper about the color of his

113
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:00.200
skin.

114
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.830
Back in the 1930s the slang term that everyone uses for black people in Germany

115
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.440
was the n word,
so you can imagine what that was like,

116
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.350
why people were calling him this all day,
every day.

117
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.580
He desperately wanted to fit in and was willing to go along with what everyone

118
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.414
else was doing.

119
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.550
When Holmes was in school,

120
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:24.130
he sat in the classroom together with the other German children.

121
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.060
He was taught about how Hitler was a hero,
save the nation from poverty and town.

122
00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:32.200
Germany was the greatest country in the world.
The minds of these young children,

123
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.300
and they were obviously being brainwashed,

124
00:06:34.301 --> 00:06:38.050
but none of these kids knew that the Nazis were killing and torturing innocent

125
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:41.170
people and they grew up to be not all followers of off Hitler.

126
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.670
When the boys 10 10 years old,

127
00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:46.540
it became mandatory for them to join the Hitler youth.
From Honda's perspective,

128
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:49.600
the members of the Hitler youth walk cool uniforms and it just seems like

129
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.670
joining a club like the boy scouts,

130
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.510
Hitler youth got to take days off school and they marched in parades while

131
00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:59.680
crowds cheered and fireworks were set off in their honor.
Propaganda posters,

132
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.340
they were everywhere and it made it seem like the Hitler youth were able to play

133
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:06.220
games all day and receive a lot of special treatments.

134
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.090
There was even a novel titled Headley Youth Cracks that came out in 1932 it's

135
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.050
the movie version premiered in 1933 comic books and Disney movies.

136
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.370
They were banned in Germany,

137
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.780
so these kids looked up to these Nazi characters of propaganda as their heroes

138
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.640
instead of the American versions in 1936 hands turn 10 years old and he believed

139
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.190
that it was finally time for him to join the Nazi party.

140
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.850
All of the boys in Hamza schools stood in the yard and the principal called out

141
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:35.170
their names one by one to announce their official enlistment in the Hitler
youth.

142
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.160
Han's stood and he waited in anticipation of his name to be called,

143
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.800
but it never was.
Out of 800 kids,

144
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.550
he was the last one left standing for anyone who was felt the pain of being

145
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.600
picked last in gym class as a kid.
Imagine the humiliation of that,

146
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.250
but times a thousand determines to be included.
Harms went with his best friends.

147
00:07:54.251 --> 00:07:56.770
Do you hit the youth office in Hamburg to try and sign up,

148
00:07:56.771 --> 00:08:00.520
but they did not allow him to join either because he was not an area in the

149
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:04.690
assays even began to hang signs in his local playgrounds saying that a non Arion

150
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:06.370
children were no longer allowed to play,

151
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:10.480
that his friend's parents appreciated how badly Hans wanted to join the Nazi

152
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:14.080
party,
which kept him in good graces with most of the adults in his life,

153
00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:15.370
but it was still difficult.

154
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.430
The one ends only thing that could help restore some of Han's.

155
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:21.640
His pride in his heritage that year was the fact that there's an African

156
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.990
American runner named Jesse Owens dominated the Berlin Olympics in 1936 this

157
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:29.680
caused a huge scandal for the Nazis who were trying to prove to the worlds that

158
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:32.290
they're Aryan.
Race was the best at everything

159
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:38.881
growing up.

160
00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:42.300
Hans would have no way of knowing that despite all of the horrible things he

161
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:44.790
went through.
He was actually extremely lucky.

162
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.940
There were very few Afro Germans living in the country during the war,

163
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.260
since Germany had colonized parts of Africa or exterminating them from their

164
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.290
main lands was a low priority compared to the Jews and Romer.
However,

165
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.810
a German anthropologist called Dr. Wolf Gang are,

166
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.440
they released a study that concluded that mixed race children were genetically

167
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:05.850
inferior to pure areas.
He said that they weren't aggressive and dangerous.

168
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.050
The mothers were basically just incubators for an alien race that wasn't fully

169
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.830
human.

170
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.460
He believes that it was necessary to sterilize all mixed race people who were

171
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:17.850
left living in Germany,
many Afro and Asian German people.

172
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.240
They were caught by the SS and they were forced to undergo surgeries that would

173
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:25.320
sterilize them so that they could no longer have children and pass on that DNA.

174
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.040
Hans [inaudible] was able to avoid this face because the authorities knew that

175
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:31.230
he was a prince and he was protected zones.
Uh,

176
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.620
a sort of diplomatic immunity when he became a teenager Parnes found out is that

177
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.320
even though he was a full Jen and citizen,

178
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.560
the Nazi laws prevented him from having any hope of a successful future.

179
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.430
Since he was non Arion poems was not allowed to pursue higher education,

180
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:48.690
so his dreams of an engineering degree and designing bridges,
they were crushed.

181
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.750
He tried to enlist in the German army after graduating high school,

182
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:54.640
but he was denied entry because of his race non Aryans.

183
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.390
They were not allowed to hold a job and they were not allowed to earn an income

184
00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:57.840
either.

185
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.620
The Nazi government made sure that he was left with almost no hope of having any

186
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:03.450
kind of life after high school.

187
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.690
Thankfully our local blacksmith took him under his wing as an apprentice.

188
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:07.860
After learning his craft,

189
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.650
he went to a job counselor to see if he could get a work assignment.

190
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.160
He did not expect much to happen since he knew that he was not allowed to work,

191
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.220
but he showed up with examples of the things that he had created during his

192
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:17.880
apprenticeship.

193
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.810
He hopes that maybe they would see as skill and make an exception to the rules.

194
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.410
The SSL looked over his papers and told him that he could not give him a job,

195
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.860
but someday soon he believed that headline would help Germany retake that

196
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:32.430
colonies in Africa and they would need loyal black men like him to help them.

197
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.480
Homes began dating a white girl for a short period of time and he took a dancing

198
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:38.760
at my clubs that played American swing music,

199
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:42.630
which had been banned by the Nazi governments.
He was taking a lot of risks,

200
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:45.120
especially since this girl's father was an ss officer.

201
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.920
They have to meet in secret at night.

202
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.040
One evening he was caught and brought into the police station.

203
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.150
Dating a white girl was violating the Nuremberg laws and to make matters worse,

204
00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:57.300
the police officer's that picked him up,
claimed that he was trying to muck up,

205
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.410
so I'm sure relationships,

206
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.230
they were forbidden and they were classified as race to fireman's by the race

207
00:11:02.231 --> 00:11:04.530
loss.
This would have been a serious enough crimes up,

208
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.540
send them to a concentration camp.
Thankfully,

209
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.750
one of the police officers from his neighborhood recognized him and vouched for

210
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:12.180
his good character.
He was able to get off the hook,

211
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:15.900
but he had to end the relationship because it was far too dangerous for them to

212
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:17.340
be together.
During the war,

213
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.550
the Germans kept African prisoners of war separate from white people.

214
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.150
They were sent to a prison called les [inaudible] blogs where they were tortured

215
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:25.320
and treated like animals.

216
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.370
The fact that harms Massaquoi was denied entry to the German army was a real

217
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:33.330
blessing in disguise because he would never have to carry the weight of guilt on

218
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:36.480
his shoulders for participating in crimes against humanity.

219
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:39.900
On behalf of the Nazis.
Many of his close friends that he grew up with,

220
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.380
they would end up dying in the war when the allies were bombing Germany hands

221
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:44.790
and his mother pat to live in hiding.

222
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.970
During the period following the allies near destruction of Hamburg,

223
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.550
he befriended the family of Ralph Giordano,

224
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.460
a half Jewish acquaintance of these swing kids,
jazz,
ots.
The GL.

225
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:58.060
Donna is managed to survive the war by hiding and help it to mass acquire and

226
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:01.330
his mother secure and nearby basement after their handbag neighborhood was

227
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.930
destroyed.
Geodon.
No.

228
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.330
A lifelong friends became a renowned journalist as well in 1945 when the war was

229
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:11.200
over.
Neither of them has anything left.
Horns,
nuances play the saxophone,

230
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.800
so he got a job playing jazz and swing and nightclubs for the American soldiers,

231
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.370
which supported him and his mother until they could move on with their lives.

232
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.720
When World War One was over,

233
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:29.410
American troops swept stationed in Germany and black men entered this all white

234
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:33.190
country.
Once again,
just like the era of the Rhineland bastards,

235
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:37.210
more mixed race babies were born when German women had relationships with black

236
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:39.940
soldiers since they were fresh out of the Nazi regime.

237
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:42.220
Racism was still a very powerful force in Germany.

238
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.050
The vast majority of these mothers,

239
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:47.860
they did not want to keep that babies and thousands of mixed race children given

240
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:48.694
to orphanages.

241
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.270
Ebony magazine brought attention to the issue by coming out with a now famous

242
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:56.640
cover with an image of a black child with bright blue eyes saying this home's

243
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.050
needed for 10 thousands Brown orphans,

244
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.920
thousands of American families steps help to adopt these children and bring them

245
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:04.090
over to the United States.

246
00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:09.091
But many of them remains to start a new generation of Afro German people in 1948

247
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.130
harms master across Faba.

248
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.680
They'll hodge was able to arrange for him to leave Germany and moved to Liberia

249
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.620
so that they could meet each other face to face for the first time.

250
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.220
Hamza realize that while his mother had always trying to speak one of them,

251
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:24.130
his father was actually rather arrogant and selfish,

252
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:26.410
so I think did not have a very good relationship.

253
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.350
Even though we thought the Liberia was a beautiful country and he could have

254
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:32.950
inherited a crown,
Hans did not want to stay there for the rest of his life.

255
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.460
He emigrated to the United States with a student visa because he plans on going

256
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:37.690
to college.
Unfortunately,

257
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:40.780
there was a fairly substantial mix up in the paperwork and he was forced to

258
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:43.330
serve in the Korean War for two years as a paratrooper,

259
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.950
even though he was not even an American citizen in 1950 he was finally able to

260
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:51.940
start his college classes at 24 years old and a journalism degree from the

261
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:54.160
University of Illinois.
After graduating,

262
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:57.990
he works for an African American publication called jet magazine and Lisa moved

263
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.430
to Chicago to work as the editor of Ebony magazine,

264
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.510
how's got married and started a family of his own in the United States for
years.

265
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.740
He only told the story of his life in Nazi Germany to his children and only

266
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:11.560
decided to write his autobiography destined to witness.

267
00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:15.850
Growing up back in Nazi Germany after he retired from his journalism career in

268
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:20.560
1999 the story of his life was shocking to a lot of people and was eventually

269
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:24.940
made into a German movie in 2006 all's well that ends well.

270
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.720
Helen's mass acquire rose and quite as satisfied with the way my life has turned

271
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:32.020
out to be.
I survived to tell the piece of history I was a witness off.

272
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.063
At the same time,

273
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.360
I wish everyone could have a happy childhood within a fast society and that's

274
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.340
definitely not my case.

275
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.600
Has Master Quad died in 2013 on his birthday after turning 87 years old at the

276
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:47.470
time of his death mask.
While I was married to the love of his life,

277
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.200
Catherine resave MassEquality,

278
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:54.260
he had two songs by a previous Steve and Holmes Jr,
who also survived him.

279
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.900
So I already have you found that video.
Interesting.
