4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.680
Galileo.
Galileo was a truth seeker.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
His quest for truth though was to bring him into conflicts with the most

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.220
powerful institution of his day,
the Roman Catholic Church.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
Through such interventions as the telescope he revealed truths that landed him

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.600
in front of the Holy Roman inquisition.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
Fighting for is very survival condemned during his life.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
He has now revealed as a true genius in today's biographics where you're getting

11
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.780
the full story on.
Galileo got la

12
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.761
Galileo.

13
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:57.200
Galileo was born on February the 15th 1564 and Pisa Italy.

14
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.640
He was the first of six children,

15
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:03.270
two Vincenzi Dubonnet Judea to Galilee and Gila Galileo,
the gala days.

16
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.250
They were from an ancient and respected family who originated in Florence.

17
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.990
Vicenzo was a world trader who has an abiding interest in philosophy,
science,

18
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
and music at the age of four days.
Young Galileo was baptized Catholic.

19
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.100
He was raised according to the strict tenants of the faith,

20
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.860
as was everybody else in the region.
From an early age,

21
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.520
Galileo showed an intense interest in making things.

22
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.960
He was constantly making small little gadgets that would amuse his friends and

23
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:34.370
his teachers.
These would include wooden animals with moving arms and legs.

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.050
He was fascinated by how machines worked and big constantly pulling things apart

25
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.850
and then putting them back together again.

26
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.470
If he was making a machine himself and Dee Dee didn't have a pot is simply

27
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.110
improvise.
When Galileo was 10 years of age,

28
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:51.740
his father decided to move the family to Florence by now Vincenzo,

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.890
who had developed a reputation as a learned and why as men,

30
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.830
despite the demands of business,
he managed to write several books,

31
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:01.040
the most popular of which was the dialogue of ancient and modern music.

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.660
Wealthy people streamed to him to benefit from his knowledge of Greek and Roman

33
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:08.030
literature and to hear his musical theories.

34
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.190
He was invited to spend some time with Duke.

35
00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.160
Albert [inaudible] of Bavaria who lived in Munich,
Germany,

36
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.530
some 300 miles from Florence.

37
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.260
Vicenza was also an active member of the Florentine Camerata.

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.060
This were a group of musicians who were experimenting with musical drama,

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.060
and that was the genesis of what would become opera.

40
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.680
Galileo and his siblings were therefore raised in an intellectually stimulating

41
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:31.430
environments.

42
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.850
Vincenzo taught his oldest son how to play a number of musical instruments,

43
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.400
the favorite of which for both was the lute.

44
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.260
Galileo also experimented with drawing and painting and showed great promise in

45
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:44.170
both of these areas,
his teenage years,

46
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.180
they coincided with the high renaissance period when Italy was being filled with

47
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:53.000
the works of the great painters,
sculptors,
and architects.

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.910
He considered devoting his life to that of an artist,

49
00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.070
but his father was king for his son to follow him into the wool Vincenzo.

50
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.630
He had a great passion for the arts,

51
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.910
but he knew that nothing but a solid business.

52
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:08.080
Korea would secure a stable financial future for his son.

53
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.470
By the time that Galileo had reached as mid teens,
it was apparent to everyone,

54
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.400
including his father,

55
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:17.350
that his keen mind was destined for greater things than life as a world trader.

56
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.460
Vincenzo sore it.

57
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.960
His duty to encourage Galileo to use his god given intellectual talents to the

58
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:23.890
fullest extent.

59
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.270
Three has studies if the works of Aristotle Oven Shenzhou hood instilled in his

60
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:33.190
some the discipline of independent study of observation and experimentation.

61
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.090
Rather than being swayed by what others had already concluded on a matter.

62
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.600
He would independently study the subject for himself and reach his own

63
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.340
conclusions based on those observations.
When he was 15 years of age,
God,

64
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.220
I have attended the Benedictine monastery of Santa Maria de Brossa from the

65
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.460
[inaudible] religion and logic.
After a few months,
however,

66
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.890
he had to return home because he got an infection

67
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.850
when he was 17 Galileo past the bachelor's exam,

68
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:06.120
which from there to do an entry to the University of Pisa Universities in the

69
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.120
16th century.
They were places attended by members of the only,

70
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:10.470
the wealthiest families,

71
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.400
and we're generally reserved for those with the ambition of becoming a priest,

72
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.080
a doctor or a professor.

73
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.310
Although Galileo seriously consider the priesthood as a young man,
Galileo or,

74
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.340
well,
I got to Galileo.

75
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:25.560
His father had decided on a career in medicine for him in order to achieve it.

76
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.350
He first had to obtain a master's degree gala day.

77
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.890
I applied himself to his studies and made excellent progress.
However,

78
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.260
several months into the first year of his medical degree,

79
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:37.890
he happens to overhear a geometry lecture being delivered by a friend of his

80
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.650
father or Stelio Richie.

81
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.830
He was immediately attracted to the logic and beauty of the math that was being

82
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:44.520
applied.

83
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.760
When Richie heard from Galileo's father that the boy was fascinated with his

84
00:04:47.761 --> 00:04:49.710
lecture,
he invited him to take his course.

85
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.340
Then Gen z would first made Richard promise not to let Galileo know that he had

86
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:57.690
consented to him taking the geometry paper and Casey sort as permission to

87
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.530
abandon his medical studies.
In addition to attending geometry lectures,

88
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.070
Galileo worked one on one with Richie is he studied the works of the Greek

89
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.920
mathematician Euclid.
As he became more deeply immersed in the subject together,

90
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:11.850
Leo became less interested in medicine.
Finally,

91
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:15.420
he confronted his father and asked him not to stand in the way of his focus on

92
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:17.910
geometry.
Vicenza he was a realist.

93
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:21.240
He knew that his son would not prosper as a doctor of his heart,
wasn't in it.

94
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.540
He agreed to support Galileo in his mathematical pursuits.

95
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.370
Often switching to mathematics,

96
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:36.270
Gallo brought his full intellectual rigor to bat on the subject.

97
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.890
He was an excellent students,

98
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.640
but he still managed to frustrate as professors the inclination to question

99
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.630
everything that his father had instilled in him meant that he would not accept

100
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.210
anything as fact established theories.

101
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:51.840
They were meaningless and I see it personally pulled them apart,
studied them,

102
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.710
and reached his own conclusions.
It was the Aristotle,

103
00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:56.280
he and scientific method in action,

104
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.500
but even the teenager to question the theories of Aristotle himself.

105
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.300
One day when he was 19 got on there,

106
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.810
happens to be in the piece of cathedral for a mass observance.
After the service,

107
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.140
he was wandering around the building when his attention happens to be caught by

108
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.690
a sculpted bronze lamp located in the Dome of the Cathedral that I'm with

109
00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:15.520
swinging back and forth like a pension.
He observed the,

110
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.320
regardless of the lessening arc of the swing,

111
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:21.260
the time that it took for each swing remained the same.

112
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.650
To check this observation,
he timed the swings with this pulse.

113
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.040
This led him to the realization that the rhythmic swings of a pendulum,

114
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.590
we're an excellent way to measure the human pulse.

115
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.580
This was the inspiration for the later invention of Galileo's a machine that was

116
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.580
designed to take pulses or a harmonic.
Also later,

117
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.530
this is the first example of Galileo not only observing and testing phenomenon,

118
00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:44.630
but also finding practical applications of his findings.

119
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.420
By 50 95 the financial strain of supporting his son's university studies.

120
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:59.250
It was too much of in Shenzhou and gala there had to withdraw from the

121
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.470
University of Pisa.
He hadn't yet completed his doctoral degree,

122
00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:04.650
but the budding genius he was not to be deterred.

123
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.100
He embarked upon his own studies by examining the works of the great minds of

124
00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:11.610
ancient Rome and ancient Greece off to dissecting the works of Archimedes.

125
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:15.210
He wrote his first scientific dissertation in which he describes an invention

126
00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:16.920
that he called the little balance.

127
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.060
This was a hydrostatic scale to measure the water balance.

128
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.990
He also developed a horsepower pump for crop irrigation that was inspired by the

129
00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:26.430
famous Archimedes screw,

130
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.450
just as his father had a decade earlier with his muscle talent.

131
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.590
Galileo began to impress important people with his practical application of

132
00:07:34.591 --> 00:07:37.380
science.
He gained a reputation as an upcoming scientist.

133
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.860
One person who was particularly interested in Galileo's work was the marquee

134
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:45.060
Geeta balladeer demonte wealthy patron with an abiding interest in astronomy,

135
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.530
mathematics,
and architecture.

136
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.830
Maki began writing together layer and the two maintained a vigorous

137
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:54.060
correspondence during which Galileo would explain his latest observations and

138
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:54.870
applications.

139
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.350
Demonte encouraged the 22 year old Galileo to study the center of gravity and

140
00:07:58.351 --> 00:07:59.161
solid bodies,

141
00:07:59.161 --> 00:08:02.310
which ultimately led to the publication of a treatise on the subject.

142
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.520
It was through del Monte.

143
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.540
The Galileo came to the attention of the grand view of Tuscany Ferdinand's the

144
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:17.680
first dumb a DG in 50 and 89 the grand Duke appointed him as a professor of

145
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:19.540
mathematics at the University of Pisa.

146
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.500
This was the position that Galileo had been hoping to secure ever since he had

147
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:25.750
been forced to quit as studies.
At the time,

148
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.890
mathematics was a minor subject of study at university that wasn't even seen as

149
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.690
worthy of study by many people.
Galileo salary was only 68 Florence a year.

150
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.040
Well for lots of any professors that n 600 or more.
In addition,

151
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:43.180
he was looked down on by them as a young upstart who dared to question the

152
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.950
teachings of the Great Harris startle to then this was akin to blast for me with

153
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:52.210
the writings of Aristotle being considered the final word on all things.

154
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.110
Ironically,

155
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.540
Galileo was simply following through the teachings of Aristotle himself who

156
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.370
championed independent study and observation while aware that his own theories

157
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:05.490
could well be over tons as new knowledge was observed.

158
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.270
The most famous example of Galileo not simply accepting one of Aristotle's

159
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.220
theories because it was written down on paper,

160
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.060
I had to do with the speed of falling objects or still solid contended that two

161
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:19.200
objects of different weights would fall to the ground at different speeds with

162
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:22.680
the heaviest object falling faster as the story goes.
Got It.
Leo,

163
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:26.580
he climbed to the top of the leaning tower of Pisa or although the building

164
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:29.540
thought to have been used may have been the church tower in Delft Tins.

165
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.270
Then he dropped two spheres of different masses to the ground below.

166
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.650
They both at the grounds at the same time disproving Aristotle's theory.

167
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.250
Galileo's experiment at the Tower of Pisa was believed to have been observed by

168
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.610
many of his students and fellow professors of the university.

169
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.120
Still some of the professors refuse to acknowledge that the young man had just

170
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:50.100
overturned one of Aristotle's theories.

171
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.360
This stubborn refusal to accept him Perico evidence that overturns long

172
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:58.590
entrenched views is something that Galileo was going to contend with for the

173
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.550
rest of his life.
Now,
just before we continue with today's video,

174
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.600
it is rather appropriately sponsored by brilliance aligning platform.

175
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.750
So whether you want to get to grips with more classical stuff like Galileo and

176
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.490
his dropping things or maybe something a bit more recent like quantum computing

177
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.590
or brilliant is the place to do it.
Now,

178
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:18.420
you've heard me talk about brilliant before.

179
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:21.390
They're a learning platform that focuses on active learning.

180
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.050
This is where you're given a short bit of information on a specific scientific

181
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:29.670
concepts and then you're asked to solve a problem based on that information.

182
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.310
It's an incredibly effective way to learn and right now,

183
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.490
brilliant have actually got something relatively new on their platform called

184
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:38.490
daily problems.
These are problems that you can do for five minutes a day.

185
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.760
They exercise your brain and they teach you something new.

186
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.440
If you're into learning new things,

187
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:45.450
which you probably are because you're watching this channel,

188
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.430
brilliant is great for you.
Each problem,

189
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.130
it provides you the context and the framework you need to tackle it.

190
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:52.980
So that means you can learn concepts by applying them.

191
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.540
That's that active learning stuff.

192
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.890
This sort of short daily practice can lead you from curiosity to mastery in far

193
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.060
less time than you would think.

194
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.750
So got a brilliant.org forward slash biographics and finish your day a little

195
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:05.940
smarter.
The first 200 of you to do so,

196
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:09.420
we'll get 20% off your annual subscription and you'll be able to view all of the

197
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.890
problems in the archives.

198
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.950
Let's get back to Galileo because it's about to make some enemies

199
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.770
not long after the tower experiments,

200
00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:24.920
Galileo was approached by a member of the powerful [inaudible] family,

201
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.910
Giovanni Dima [inaudible],
and asked to evaluate a machine that he had invented.

202
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.300
The machine was designed to dredge the Hubble bottoms of lake on to remove the

203
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.540
mucky layer runs,
make them safer for ships to come into Galileo.

204
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:36.740
Carefully studied the machine.

205
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:40.370
Oh need to conclude that it was badly designed and is not fit for purpose.

206
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.260
This presented a bit of a problem.

207
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.890
Should it be honest and tell the man that the machine wouldn't work or should he

208
00:11:45.891 --> 00:11:48.410
play Katen with false praise?

209
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.240
The [inaudible] were the most powerful clan in SLE and Galileo was very wary

210
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.480
getting on the wrong side of any of them.
Still,

211
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.130
his loyalty to scientific truth would not allow him to deceive the inventor in a

212
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:00.881
public forum.

213
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:04.420
He spelled out what was wrong with the machine and assured everyone presence

214
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.220
that it would not work.

215
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.510
His opinion was born out when the machine proved to be a dismal failure.

216
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.440
Galileo is honesty had created a powerful enemy.
They humiliated.

217
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.920
The digi man was determined to bring Galileo down and he set about getting him

218
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:20.080
fired from his professorship at the university.

219
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.250
Under the advice of Marquee get Ebaldo Demante yellow layer,
he resigned.

220
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.910
His position done won't say it opened the door to a new posting as the chairman

221
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:32.290
of mathematics at the University of Pedulla 130 miles northeast of Piza.

222
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.250
This was a big step up together lobe.
He was now making 180 Florence,

223
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:38.470
which was three times his previous income.
Also,

224
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.530
he no longer had to contend with the ridicule of his fellow professors.

225
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.540
He soon became a very popular lecturer with his classes almost overflowing at

226
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.880
party where he also found the time to work on his inventions and his writings.

227
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.300
He became an expert at applying science step military fortifications,

228
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.370
designing reinforced walls for Fort.

229
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:59.370
Since mechanically superiors see Jen Gins in 1593 he was invited to Venice to

230
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.981
give advice on the ideal positioning of a rowing ships or is to generate maximum

231
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:06.160
use of manpower.

232
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.660
In 1593 Galileo developed an undiagnosed illness which kept him in pain,

233
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.000
affected his appetite,
and robbed him of sleep.

234
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.810
These symptoms would affect him for the rest of his life.
Despite your sickness,

235
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:20.470
he managed to meet as university obligations at the end of his first six year

236
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:23.380
term at Pad Europe,
he was appointed for a further six years.

237
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.160
By the ends of the 50 nineties Galileo had invented a range of products which

238
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:28.870
were in demand all over the country.

239
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.740
These included an irrigation pump that required only a single horse to power it

240
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.970
and the sector which was used to measure precise angles lacking the time to

241
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:38.110
produce each piece himself.

242
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:42.400
He hired a craftsman named Mark Antonio Mad Celeni to make as inventions.

243
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.620
It wasn't until the mid 50 nineties the Galileo took any serious interest in

244
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:54.300
astronomy without studying the issue.

245
00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:58.110
He believes in the Ptolemaic theory that the sun and other planets revolved

246
00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:01.440
around the earth.
When a visiting lecturer spoke on the Copernican theory,

247
00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:05.220
which contended that the earth and other planets actually revolve around the
sun,

248
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.820
Galileo did not attend considering the theory to be ridiculous.

249
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.460
Sometime later he was talking with some of his students.

250
00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:14.430
He would attended the lecture.
Most of them didn't accept the new theory,

251
00:14:14.431 --> 00:14:16.530
but there was one person who did.

252
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.790
It was then the Galileo had a simple but profound realization.

253
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.750
Every person who had abandoned the Ptolemaic theory in favor of the Copernican

254
00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:27.090
theory would be subjected to ridicule.

255
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.840
They words therefore only do so on the basis of overwhelming evidence.

256
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.070
He was now obsessed with finding out what that evidence was.

257
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.640
The question of whether the sun or the earth was at the center of the universe

258
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.920
would consume him for the rest of his life.

259
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.360
Even though he continued to teach the theories of taller man his classes,

260
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.030
he became more convinced.
The Copernicus was actually right.

261
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.740
In 1597 he established written communication with the astronomer,

262
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:54.890
Yohanis Capp Lowe,
who was also an advocate of the Copernican theory.

263
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.970
Capital had published a work supporting good Panaca us and encouraged Galileo to

264
00:14:58.971 --> 00:15:00.620
do the same.
However,
the Italian,

265
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.640
he always worried that doing so would bring upon him the anger of the Catholic

266
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:04.641
Church,

267
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:09.020
which held that the earth was undoubtedly at the center of the universe on a

268
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:12.500
visit to Venice.
Got they ever met a woman by the name of Marina Gamba.

269
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.130
Our relationship developed with marina moving in with him before long.

270
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.240
The child was born in the unwed couple of the first of three two girls and a boy

271
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.930
in 1610 gather.
They left Patois taking his two daughters,

272
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.900
both givens of the conference eventually due to the illegitimate births,

273
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.710
but he left behind his son Vicenzo with marina.
Years later,

274
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.210
marina marries another man,
but God,

275
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:34.460
I remained friendly with her throughout his lifetime.

276
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.850
In the first decade of the 16 hundreds Galileo continued to invent new

277
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:48.160
technologies.
In 1604 he observed and discussed capital Supernova.

278
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.190
His talk was so popular that he had to move from the overcrowded lecture theater

279
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:54.680
to an outside forum so that everyone could hear him.

280
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.670
In 1609 Galilea began working on a machine that would magnify the night sky.

281
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.620
He used to eyeglass lenses.

282
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.300
One concave and the other convex placing them opposite ends of a long metal

283
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:09.200
tube.
We're looking through this Venetian glass later gold a telescope.

284
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.480
The stars were magnified several times.

285
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.710
The invention was a hit and prominent people from all over Italy clambered to

286
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:16.191
get a look.

287
00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:19.850
It's this amazing machine which allowed you to see things that are far away.

288
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.020
It's telescopes.

289
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.220
They were also a profitable sideline for Galileo who sold them to merchants.

290
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:28.430
You found them useful both at sea and as items of trade.

291
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.030
The invention reflected positively on the University of Padua prompting the

292
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:35.810
boards who offer Galileo a lifetime professorship and increase his salary to a

293
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:36.890
thousand and Florence.

294
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.460
Before long Galileo had improved his telescope and send it was able to magnify

295
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.880
up to 30 times.
This enables him to look through it at the moon.

296
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.790
He discovered that rather than being perfectly round and smooth,

297
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.990
as Aristotle had written,
it was rough and filled with craters and valleys.

298
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.250
Is Telescope also in,

299
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:55.880
they would Galileo to identify and observe the moons of other planets.

300
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.470
During the period between January the eighth and the 14 1610 he discovered that

301
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:03.830
Jupiter had four moons.
Then in July of that same year,

302
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:06.640
he became the first person to identify the rings around Saturn.

303
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.070
Though he didn't quite realize what they were at the time.
Later that year,

304
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:13.700
he identified the Jupiter and Mars had phases which were similar to the moon.

305
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.570
There is telescope.
Galileo was able to identify that there were many,

306
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.010
many more stars than had originally been thought and that therefore the universe

307
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:24.530
was simply much larger than previously thought.

308
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.440
This upset too many people who thought that through his telescope,

309
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:30.740
Galileo was using some form of trickery to make new discoveries.

310
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.490
In 1609 he was invited to move to the palace of the grand.
You can Florence.

311
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.520
He except is moving back to his home region of Tuscany,

312
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.670
has dropped now involved with giving lectures to princes and other members of

313
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:42.800
the royal family,
not them got having to lecture.

314
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:45.830
He now had the freedom to study and write books.

315
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.420
By 1615 there was a rising tide of opposition to Galileo.

316
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.200
Many of his discoveries had flown in the face of accepted church doctrine,

317
00:17:59.201 --> 00:18:02.080
which was closely aligned with the teachings of Aristotle.

318
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.100
People began asserting that his findings were at odds with the scriptures,

319
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.140
which were the revealed word of God.

320
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.430
Galileo responded by writing that the Bible was not a scientific textbook,

321
00:18:12.431 --> 00:18:16.600
but where it touched on science,
it was actually in harmony with his findings.

322
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.260
He thought that people had simply interpreted the scriptures and correctly the

323
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.500
of the Galileo wrote soon found its way into the hands of his enemies,

324
00:18:23.501 --> 00:18:25.270
particularly the Dominican's of some mark.

325
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.370
They viewed what he had written as heresy,

326
00:18:27.371 --> 00:18:30.640
and so they made sure that a copy of the letter got in front of the pope in
Rome.

327
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.180
The pope called for the leading Dominican to come and give testimony about

328
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.043
Galileo.

329
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.560
There's mountain made the most of the opportunity telling lies to paint Galileo

330
00:18:38.561 --> 00:18:42.070
and his followers as blasphemous.
Galileo.
He was not coward.

331
00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.400
He considered those who spoke against him as ignorant fools,

332
00:18:45.401 --> 00:18:47.680
and he sat out to defend himself to do so.

333
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.430
He traveled to the center of the culture in itself,
Rome,

334
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.410
he appearance before the Holy Office on February the 26th 1616 and was ordered

335
00:18:56.411 --> 00:19:00.430
to never again teach that the sun was the center of the universe is reasoned

336
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:04.510
arguments.
In his defense,
it fell on deaf ears.
Galileo remained in rooms,

337
00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:05.950
you argue with his detractors.

338
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.970
This was not pleasing to his patron back in the court of Tuscany who felt that

339
00:19:09.971 --> 00:19:14.470
the conflicts could cause a rift between them and Rome.
In June,
Galileo,

340
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.170
he finally complied.
Returning to Florence,

341
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.410
the stress of defending his reputation.
It had taken a toll on Galileo.

342
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.130
He was constantly plagued with physical pain and spend increasing amounts of

343
00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:28.720
time.
Bedridden.
In 1617 he moved to a hilltop village just outside of Florence.

344
00:19:28.721 --> 00:19:32.380
In order to benefit from the rural app,
he continued to study the heavens,

345
00:19:32.381 --> 00:19:35.110
but was now far more guarded about what he wrote.

346
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.780
Then in 1618 his elements worsened.

347
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.530
He was confined to bed for several weeks and he became extremely weak.

348
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.280
By 1624 there was a new pope,
urban the eighth as a cardinal.

349
00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:47.500
He had expressed admiration for Galileo bus.

350
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.860
He had never agreed with the Copernican theory that's slightly recovered.

351
00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:53.860
Galileo was convinced to make a pilgrimage to Rome in order to meet with the

352
00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:57.610
pope in order to assess his standing with pontiff urban receive too well.

353
00:19:57.611 --> 00:20:00.450
Even presenting a Madeline's promising a pension gather.

354
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:03.880
They will also notice that the church officials around the room were far less

355
00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:05.800
hostile to him than they had been before.

356
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.640
He felt confidence believing that the new pope had ease the pressure on him.

357
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.820
In 1629 Galileo wrote a masterful work dialogue concerning the two chief weld

358
00:20:15.161 --> 00:20:15.790
systems,

359
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.900
which presented a dialogue between three men on the merits of the Ptolemaic and

360
00:20:19.901 --> 00:20:22.690
Copernican theories before it can be published.
Yantra presenters,

361
00:20:22.691 --> 00:20:24.670
the chief censor of the press in Rome.

362
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.390
He was forced to make changes that presented the Ptolemaic theory and a far more

363
00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:32.740
favorable light and to state clearly that the idea is expressed were not facts,

364
00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:36.100
but simply opinions.
Galileo,
he made the changes,

365
00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:40.720
but a series of delays prevented the book's publication until 1632

366
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:47.960
the new book brought out

367
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.710
<v 4>the ire of the enemies of the now 68 year old Galileo.</v>

368
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.560
When pope urban got to read it,
he became enraged.

369
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.830
He became convinced that one of the three debates is in the book was based on

370
00:20:56.831 --> 00:21:01.000
himself and he considered this to be a insult of the highest level.

371
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.110
In August of 1632 all copies of the book sold in bookstores were seized in the

372
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.900
printer was ordered to cease publication.
Then in September,

373
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.740
Galileo was ordered to appear before the holy Roman inquisition after stalling

374
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:12.670
due to El healthy.

375
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.760
Finally headed to Rome to faces inquisitor's on January the 20th 1633 he had to

376
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:21.170
wait until April the 12th to appear before the vice commissioner of the only

377
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.490
office and to other examiners for preliminary questioning.

378
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.840
It was stated that his book was in direct violation of the 1616 OFI had taken

379
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:32.200
not to publicly discuss the teachings of Copernicus.
In his defense,

380
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:35.600
Galileo contended that the book was simply a dialogue between the two theories

381
00:21:35.601 --> 00:21:39.310
and did not favor the view that the sun was at the center of the universe.

382
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.030
The second interview was held on April the 30th this time Galileo was more

383
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:43.864
conciliatory,

384
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.040
agreeing that the arguments in favor of the Copernican theory come to the heir

385
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:52.300
of the reader with far greater force and power than should have been imparted to

386
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:55.570
them by someone who regarded them as inconclusive.

387
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.990
The interview concluded with the examiners agreeing to give Galileo time to

388
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:00.400
prepare his full defense.

389
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.450
That hearing was held on June the 20 fast before he could fully develop his

390
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:04.871
defense.

391
00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:09.250
He was asked point blank whether he had ever held to the Copernican theory.

392
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.490
He owns it,
that he had initially been in different to both theories,

393
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:16.780
but after careful study now believed in the wisdom of the Ptolemaic theory.

394
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.920
This was clearly not true and none of the examiners believed him.

395
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.671
The following day.

396
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:25.240
He was sentenced to prison with the time to be decided later and his book was

397
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:29.440
banned.
He was then made to read a statement of apology on bended knee.

398
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.730
Pope urban seemed satisfied with the south com Galileo who'd been both condemned

399
00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:36.490
and humiliated.
The pope decided that the imprisonment,

400
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:40.030
so which Galileo had been sentenced could be carried out by way of home

401
00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:43.690
detention.
That's the Grand Duke of Tuscany is villa near room.
However,

402
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:47.350
the Galileo was desperate to live out his last years in Florence where his

403
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:50.290
family were located.
He wrote to the pope,
begging has indulgence,

404
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:53.860
which he was granted he would be confined to the villa of a powerful friends.

405
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.190
After five months he was permitted to return to his own villa,

406
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.771
<v 0>Galileo,</v>

407
00:23:03.771 --> 00:23:08.320
his final years remarks by ill-health by 1637 he was nearly totally blinds

408
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.970
before his site was gone completely.

409
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:14.170
He managed to complete his last stands in his view is most outstanding work

410
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.030
entitled discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations of two new sciences under

411
00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:19.960
the rules of a sentence.

412
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:23.320
He could not publish it in Italy and so the manuscript was smuggled to Amsterdam

413
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:27.280
and publish that during his last day as the blind genius received many visitors

414
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:27.940
to his villa.

415
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.940
He died on January the eighth 1642 at the age of 77 he had been fighting fever

416
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.840
and heart problems for months,

417
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.410
nearly a hundred years later with this brilliant having finally been recognized,

418
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:40.280
his remains were removed from the chaplet,

419
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.650
Santa Croce and relocated to a much more elaborate mausoleum inside the church

420
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.650
during move three fingers and a tooth removed from his remains,

421
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.640
one of these fingers.

422
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:53.210
The middle finger from Galileo's righthand is currently on exhibition at the

423
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:55.340
Museo,
Galileo and Florence,

424
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.990
Italy and monuments was also erected with a bust of Galileo and two fingers

425
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:04.940
representing his monumental achievements in the worlds of astronomy and
geometry.
