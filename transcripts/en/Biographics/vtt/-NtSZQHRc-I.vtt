1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.540
He grew up to be over six feet tall,

2
00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:04.490
the fashionable dresser and friends with some of the most famous Americans of

3
00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:08.810
his time,
but he started his life in a corner of the Austrian empire.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.720
In today's video,
we're talking about the great Nikola Tesla.

5
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.620
When Nikola Tesla was born,
the Austrian empire,

6
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.390
it's still existed and ethnic sir.

7
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.310
He came into the wells in modern day Croatia on July the 10th 1856 his birth

8
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.050
seem to foreshadow his life's work as his mother was in labor during a massive

9
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:43.780
lightning storm.
The lightening,
the flash during Tesla's birth,

10
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:46.620
who was considered to be an ill omen by the midwife,
but Tesla,

11
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.550
his mother didn't greed.
Instead,

12
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.410
she proclaims that he will be a child of light.
His mother was not wrong.

13
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.950
As we know today,
Tesla is the reason we have alternating current electricity,

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.050
but on top of that,
starting in childhood,

15
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:03.130
Tesla saw flashes of light that reportedly canes him before he had ideas.

16
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.060
There is another side to the story of these flashes of light that has emerged.

17
00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:07.720
However,

18
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.770
it's possible that these flashes or visions were actually caused by a traumatic

19
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.010
events that he witnessed in his childhood.
When destiny was just five years old,

20
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:18.070
he saw his only brother Dane die in a horse riding accidents.

21
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.720
It was after this that Tesla began having the flashes of light and his visions.

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.290
These were something that would stay with him for the rest of his life.

23
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.820
The family,
they lived in a modest home,

24
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.180
one that has since been rebuilt and has a statue of Tesla in the yard.

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.510
That's when his father was an eastern Orthodox minister and his mother was a

26
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.640
brilliant woman who was an inventor herself.

27
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.630
She created mechanical appliances to use around the house and to tinkering and

28
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:43.510
creative thinking.
Undoubtedly influenced her son,

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.030
tested his mother also has an incredible memory.

30
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.770
She could memorize entire epic poems and Tesla credited his own photographic

31
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:55.480
memory to the genes that he inherited from his mother.
He memorized entire books.

32
00:01:55.481 --> 00:02:00.190
He visualized his projects and ideas and he spoke several languages and his

33
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:04.000
other years at school,
Tesla studies focused on German,
maths and religion.

34
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.580
By the time he entered the later years of his education,

35
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.470
signs had become a key focus.

36
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.430
He moved away from his family in order to do attends the higher real gymnasium

37
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.880
here.
Tesla was accused of cheating because of his photographic memory.

38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.350
His outstanding memory allows him to perform integral calculus using only as

39
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:20.980
minds.

40
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.540
No panel paper was required and this led his teachers to become suspicious.

41
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.140
Nonetheless,
Tusla was able to finish the necessary work,

42
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:32.020
actually graduate in only three years instead of the customary four.

43
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.480
During his three years at the high real gymnasium,

44
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:38.800
Testa was introduced to a phenomenon that ultimately defined his career and how

45
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.840
he's remembered today and his physics class.

46
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:45.841
The teacher demonstrated electricity and Tesla was utterly fascinated by it,

47
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.110
but it would be some time before he could launch a career studying and using

48
00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:50.944
electricity.

49
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.980
He became ill shortly after graduating in 1873 for nine months he was bedridden

50
00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:01.471
with color and only narrowly escaped his brush with death helped form Tesla is

51
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.580
lifelong Germaphobic tendencies.

52
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.410
He was so fearful of jams that it took him 18 napkins to get through a single

53
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:09.244
meal.

54
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.690
In 1874 Tesla was expected to be conscripted into the military and he had no

55
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:17.380
interest in serving so he managed to escape the requirements by running away to

56
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:20.950
a mountainous region where he was able to disguise himself as a hunter.

57
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.611
After a year,

58
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.200
Tesla was able to emerge from the mountains and start seriously studying
science.

59
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.240
He began attending classes at Austria pall attack and Eric,

60
00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:33.220
who very quickly showed himself to be both a talented and diligent students.

61
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.031
In fact,

62
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:38.380
he may actually have been a little too diligence years after he left the school

63
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:39.640
and after his father had died,

64
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.730
Tesla discovered a pile of letters that the school sent to his father,

65
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.020
warning them that Tesla was overworking himself.
According to Tesla himself,

66
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:51.430
he was working incredibly hard getting up at 3:00 AM and not going to bed until

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.420
11:00 PM during that time,
he was fully focused on his studies.

68
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.810
He didn't even take off holidays or Sundays from this routine.

69
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.670
By the time his first year was over.

70
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:05.290
He had passed it twice as many exams as he needed to and received the highest

71
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.520
grades that were possible,

72
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.170
but even someone with a brain like Tesla's couldn't sustain that kind of

73
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:11.830
schedule.

74
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.940
His second year in school was a complete reversal from his first after losing a

75
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.330
scholarship.
At the end of his second year at Tesla,
began gambling,
gambling.

76
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.450
It wasn't just a pastime for him,
though he was totally addicted to us.

77
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.140
He lost his tuition,
money,
gambling,
and then when final exams rolled around,

78
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.060
he was unprepared to take them.
Indeed,

79
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.490
you never did take them and he never graduated.

80
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.460
Unwilling to face his family and tell them that he never graduated.

81
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.270
Tesla simply fled to the town of Meribah and took up work as a draftsman.

82
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.080
It was here that he started gambling again,
playing cards on the street.
At first,

83
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.030
some of Tesla's friends thought that he had drowned,

84
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:45.040
but Tesla's father figured out the truth.

85
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.810
Eventually he tried to get his son to return home at Tesla.
He adamantly refused.

86
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.220
Eventually he was forced to,

87
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.790
or a town home when he was arrested for not having a resident's permit for yet.

88
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.030
Tesla worked as a teacher in Gospick for town.
Rose family lived,

89
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.560
but his extended family,

90
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.730
they wanted to help him get back to school so they pooled their funds and off to

91
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:07.390
Prague he went,
but it wasn't an easy jump back into academia.

92
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.560
He arrived too late.
Do you actually enrolled and even if he hadn't been late,

93
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.710
Tesla was missing some of the key studies required to enroll.

94
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.340
Namely these were check and Greek.
So Tesla once again,

95
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:20.380
did not achieve as academic dreams bars.

96
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.010
By 1881 he was able to find work in his preferred field.

97
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.970
He had found a job as an electrical engineer with a central telephone company in

98
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.470
Budapest.
While working there,

99
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.250
he and a friend had a habit of walking through the park one day during the walk.

100
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:37.660
Tesla,
I've got one of his visions.
He knew how to bills and induction motor.

101
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.320
He picked up a stick,
found a patch of dirt and sketched out his idea that,

102
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:45.010
and then he then went on to build a prototype of this motor.

103
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.680
It made sense to him and he knew the importance of it,

104
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.980
but he couldn't drum up much interest for his invention in Europe.

105
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.030
Wow.
Tesla was working in Europe.
Thomas Edison had launched his Edison Company,

106
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.390
which included a branch in Paris,
Tesla.

107
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:11.240
It secured a job at the Continental Edison company helping with the installation

108
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.380
of lighting in Paris.

109
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.910
His talents were soon taken advantage of for design and for trouble shooting.

110
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.080
Within two years,

111
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.980
he was recruited to travel to America and his work for Edison directly in New

112
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.370
York.
He ends hundreds of others who worked in Manhattan installing lights and

113
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.220
building out in electric utility for New York City.

114
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.270
Tesla described his experiences and impressions of Edison.

115
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.240
Thusly I came from bearers in the spring of 1880 forum was brought in intimate

116
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:38.840
contact with him.
Thomas Edison.
We experiments it day and night.

117
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.440
His existence was made up of ultimate periods of work and sleep and the

118
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:43.274
laboratory.

119
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.510
He had no Hobie cat for no sport or amusements of any kinds and lived in utter

120
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.420
disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene.

121
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.240
That can be no doubt that if he had not married later,

122
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:57.080
a woman of exceptional intelligence who made it to the one object of her life to

123
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:57.830
preserve him,

124
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.130
he would have died many years ago from consequences of sheer neglect.

125
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.400
So great and uncontrollable was his passion for work,

126
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.910
but as he has in his first year of school,
Tessa was also a nonstop worker.

127
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.461
One story,

128
00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:12.050
it relates that he stayed out all night working and took some jobs from people

129
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:13.100
for being out all night.

130
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.600
When Edison found out he was actually out working Tesla and Addison's respect

131
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.620
working for Edison,
it wasn't ideal for Tesla,

132
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.890
like he only lost it six months at the company.

133
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.210
Edison and Tesla disagreed over alternating current and direct current with

134
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.720
Tesla at favoring alternating currents and Edison favoring direct,

135
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.770
but it's still unclear if this disagreement was the primary reason why Tesla

136
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:34.880
ended up leaving the company.

137
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.140
Tesla and Edison also differed in their approaches to business and science.

138
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.720
Addison was attuned.
Stevie marketing side of things.

139
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:46.550
While Tesla was highly focused on the scientific invention and innovation part

140
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:47.300
of its work,

141
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.660
it's possible his leaving may have been precipitated by a bonus that he thought

142
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.850
he was guessing,
which he was later refused.

143
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.120
A manager at the Edison company had challenged employees to design it to

144
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.170
different machines.

145
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.260
The first person to successfully do so would receive a huge bonus $50,000 which

146
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:05.600
translates to millions of dollars by today's standards.

147
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.650
Desola jumped at the chance to tackle this invention and a huge amount of money.

148
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.760
He completed the task,
presented his work and was denied the bonus.

149
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.630
The manager and Edison claimed that the challenge had been issued jokingly and

150
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.450
Addison himself told and upset Tesla,
Tesla,

151
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.470
you don't understand our American humor regardless of the reason.

152
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:28.820
The fact is that tests the departed from Edison's company only after a few short

153
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:28.940
months,

154
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.300
he had his in his mind that he was going to start his own company where he would

155
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:34.880
research and work with alternating current.

156
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.320
It wasn't so easy to get assaulted.
They went tests,
liquid Edison's company.

157
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:52.970
He had to earn money to live on like digging ditches for only $2 a day.

158
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.850
My High Education in various branches of science and mechanics and literature

159
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.980
seemed to me like a mockery.

160
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.520
He said if this time while he was doing that though he was pitching investors,

161
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.480
he founds people who liked what they heard and trusted the scientific knowledge

162
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:07.530
of this young immigrants.

163
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.060
By 1895 he was working on getting his art lighting system patenters and had a

164
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:16.110
funding promise from two businessmen to start Tesla electric lights and

165
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.770
manufacturing or any of the year into the venture though they pulled out and

166
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:23.970
left Tesla in the lurch.
Yes.
Again,
the inventor was penniless.

167
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.620
In 1886 he met two men who were looking to invest in scientific inventions.

168
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.200
They sent us the rub with a laboratory in New York City,

169
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:36.150
established a profit sharing structure and the Tesla Electric Company was born

170
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.200
in only a year.

171
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.190
Tesla had created an induction motor that ran on alternating currents.

172
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.290
This time he had two business partners who weren't ready and willing to handle

173
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.610
the marketing and business end of things.

174
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.540
Soon after Tesla published a paper in entitled a new system of alternating

175
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.310
current motors and transformers.

176
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.990
It laid out his ideas and to got him noticed George Westinghouse as one of the

177
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.360
people who read the paper and he liked what he read,

178
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.490
Westinghouse licensed Tesla's induction motor and also gave him a consulting job

179
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:08.670
at the Westinghouse electric and manufacturing lab in Pittsburgh.

180
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.780
Westinghouse wanted to be the person who provided the United States with long

181
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.400
distance power and he believed Tesla was the person who is going to help him

182
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.360
achieve that goal.

183
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.500
In the early 1890s Westinghouse and Edison were competing heavily in the

184
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:23.334
electric industry.

185
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.090
Edison was throwing out claims that tested as AC current wasn't safe,

186
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.600
and meanwhile Westinghouse was facing financial difficulties,

187
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.100
but Westinghouse paid Tesla for the licensing and so he had the ability to

188
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:38.430
continue working on projects that he wanted to one of these projects,

189
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.150
you might actually have heard of it,
that would be a Tesla coil.
The Tesla Coil,

190
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:46.560
which he passengers in 1891 allows electricity to be transmitted wirelessly.

191
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.810
It was the first invention of its kind and it was used in antennas that we used

192
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:54.660
to send telegraphs and even though the original design isn't used anymore,

193
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.070
a different version of this is still used in TV and radio to this very day.

194
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.820
1891 was also another landmark and testers life for it was the year that he was

195
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:04.440
granted us citizenship.

196
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.000
Tesla continued his relationship with Westinghouse into the 1890s as they sought

197
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:12.150
his help for the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

198
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.250
Westinghouse was in charge of lighting the entire events but also had their own

199
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:22.170
display that here he gave demonstrations to the public showing how a AC current

200
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.073
works.

201
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.503
<v 1>Eh,</v>

202
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.770
<v 0>Tesla is next major project.
It came at Niagara Falls.</v>

203
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.810
Power was being generated by the false,

204
00:11:37.811 --> 00:11:41.920
but there wasn't need for an efficient transmission system based on Tesla's

205
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:42.671
recommendation.

206
00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:46.450
Westinghouse was hard to build an AC generation system at Niagara.

207
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.680
Tesla did the design work and the resulting to hydroelectric power plants began

208
00:11:50.681 --> 00:11:53.920
providing electricity to the city of Buffalo,
New York.

209
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.240
With all of these projects.

210
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:59.320
Tesla was gaining visibility both in America and the rest of the worlds.

211
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.280
He was also getting to know many high profile people and not all of them were in

212
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:04.390
the scientific sphere.

213
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.840
One of the American celebrities that Tesla got to know was Mark Twain.

214
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.680
Even when he was living in Croatia,
Tesla was reading Twain's books.

215
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.220
The two Matt in New York City haven't crossed paths at a social events.

216
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.400
Twain had always been interested in technological innovation,

217
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.280
so the two spends much time together in Teslas lab,

218
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.390
a photograph of twins hands that Tesla took using light from crooks tubes

219
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.360
brought to Tesla right to the edge of discovering x rays.

220
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.840
Unfortunately though he didn't realize quite how close he had come until x rays

221
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:35.740
were actually discovered and the use of crooks tubes in the invention was made

222
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:38.800
known.
There's,
there's not the only experiment that twain was a part of.
Though.

223
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.310
There was also an experiment that was specifically designed to address Twain's

224
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.540
digestive issues.

225
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.780
Drain was often constipated and he wasn't shy about complaining of this

226
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:47.530
condition.

227
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.920
Tesla had developed a vibrating disc that would essentially shake whoever's

228
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:51.763
stood on top of it.

229
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.210
Here it's author friend to climb on board the device and literally have his

230
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:58.540
digestion issues solved by shaking his bowels a loose.

231
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.360
When Tesla thought that's way in herds,
add enough of the shaking treatments.

232
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:04.360
He told him to get off,
but well twain,
he didn't.
Once he get off,

233
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.270
he stayed on top of the desk and was continued to be shaken.

234
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.330
Ignoring Tesla's urgings,
he should not have ignored.

235
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.560
Tesla's urgings there because eventually the shaking did its job and then some.

236
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.720
The famous author,

237
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.840
quite literally a went to the bathroom in his suit in the middle of Nikola Tesla

238
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.180
is laboratory Tesla and never stopped inventing.

239
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.480
He said that he only slept two hours per night and was always looking for the

240
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:29.350
next projects.
Wireless transmission of electricity was one of his main goals,

241
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.960
but he needed funding to achieve this.
Living in New York,

242
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.150
he had ample access to wealthy people.

243
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.260
He was able to convince j Pierpont Morgan of the viability of wireless

244
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.094
transmission,

245
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.130
and the banker provided him with $150,000 to build a transmission tower.

246
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.770
He was competing with Marconi to transmit wireless messages,

247
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.520
but Marconi got their first investors,
including Morgan,

248
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.940
pulled their funds from testing this project and he was forced to abandon the

249
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:57.820
effort.
In 1906 when the project was abandoned,

250
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.980
Tesla didn't just have to stop construction.

251
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.860
He actually had to mortgage the property Tesla,

252
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.500
and he owed huge amounts of money to the Waldorf Astoria.

253
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.620
He lived at the lavish hotel and he lived large spending $20,000 which is nearly

254
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.410
half a million dollars today.

255
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.890
In the short time he lived there in 1917 the transmission tower,

256
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:17.500
it was demolished after Tesla lost it in foreclosure.

257
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.880
They also tried to see Marconi asserting that he had stolen Tesla's ideas in

258
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:24.700
order to create his wireless transmission technology.

259
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.953
<v 1>Eh,</v>

260
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.690
<v 0>Tesla was a genius.
There's no doubt about it,
but he was also a difficult man.</v>

261
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.750
He had many quirks and obsessions and was completely,

262
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.760
utterly focused on his work.

263
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.240
He never married thinking that a woman in his life would interfere with his
work.

264
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.200
As he said,

265
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.340
I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been by married men,

266
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.240
but there are also indications that Tesla perhaps didn't think he was worthy of

267
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:59.540
women.
He also became dissatisfied with the attitude of modern women.

268
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.420
In the 1920s in the 1924 interview,

269
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.610
Tesla explained his thoughts on women.

270
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.380
I had always thought of women as possessing those delicate qualities of mind and

271
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:13.100
soul that made her in these respects far superior to man.

272
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.140
I had put her on a lofty pedestal.

273
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.350
I worshiped at the feet of the creature ride raised to this height,

274
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.210
hands like every three worshiper.

275
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.390
I felt myself unworthy of the object of my worship.

276
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.120
There's all this was in the past now,
the soft voice,

277
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.140
Gentle Woman of my reverent worship has all but vanished in our place,
has come.

278
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:34.190
The woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as

279
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:36.740
much as possible like Nan in dress,

280
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.630
voice and actions in sports and achievements of every kind.
It's Tesla,

281
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.050
put some of his social ends nurturing energy that he wasn't putting towards

282
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:48.710
women towards the pigeons that flops around in New York City and it's one pigeon

283
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:51.710
in particular caught his attention.
I've been feeding pigeons,

284
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.860
thousands of them for years,
but there was one,
a beautiful bird,

285
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.490
pure white with light gray tips on its wings.
That one was different.

286
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.413
It was a female.

287
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.690
I had only two wishes and call her and she would come flying to me.

288
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.280
I love that pigeon as man loves a woman and she loved me as long as I had her.

289
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.190
That was purpose to my life.
When that pigeon was hurt,

290
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.190
Tesla invented a device that would help here let's swing and leg,
right.

291
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:14.763
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

292
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.380
<v 0>Tesla lived out the rest of his life in New York City.
He never married,</v>

293
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.890
but he did surround himself with the famous and intellectual people of the day

294
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.780
invented constantly right up through the 1930s until he was well in his

295
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.310
seventies in January,

296
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.940
1943 and they decided to enter Tesla's hotel room even though he had put up a do

297
00:16:39.941 --> 00:16:43.150
not disturb sign.
This sign had been in place for 48 hours,

298
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:44.470
and when the maid opened the door,

299
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.950
she was confronted with the site of the famous inventors body.

300
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:53.040
He died of coronary thrombosis at the age of 86 behind in Tesla,

301
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.040
