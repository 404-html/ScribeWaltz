1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.860
<v Speaker 1>In high school,</v>

2
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.860
<v Speaker 1>the student interested in taking apart and rebuilding machines,</v>

3
00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:07.820
<v Speaker 1>approached the CEO of Hewlett Packard and asked for some parts to help him</v>

4
00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>complete a class project.</v>

5
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Duly impressed the CEO,</v>

6
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>made arrangements for the student to get the parts and two years later he was</v>

7
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>probably thrilled to be able to say that he took the time to do so.</v>

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Because of that confidence.</v>

9
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:17.871
<v Speaker 1>Students,</v>

10
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you also the parts.</v>

11
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>that was Steve Jobs,</v>

13
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>a man who would go on to become the CEO of apple computers and a preeminent</v>

14
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>figure in the tech industry.</v>

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs was born to two unmarried graduates in 1955.</v>

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.611
<v Speaker 1>Curiously,</v>

17
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>this is just nine months before Microsoft founder Bill Gates.</v>

18
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>His parents gave him up for adoption and jobs,</v>

19
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>was 30 years old in well in the midst of Tech Start and before he learned about</v>

20
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.140
<v Speaker 1>his birth parents symptoms growing up,</v>

21
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>the only family he knew was his adoptive parents.</v>

22
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>A couple of from mountain view,</v>

23
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>California who fostered his interest in taking apart and rebuilding machines.</v>

24
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 1>His father pulled jobs,</v>

25
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.511
<v Speaker 1>was a machinist.</v>

26
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>He taught jobs about electronics through now the age working in the family</v>

27
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>

28
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>The team spent hours tinkering on projects during those work sessions,</v>

29
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>in the carriage jobs.</v>

30
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>His father taught him a lesson that has made its way into apple's products of</v>

31
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>all shapes and sizes.</v>

32
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't sacrifice any part of the design,</v>

33
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>no matter where it is on the product.</v>

34
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.971
<v Speaker 1>Jobs later.</v>

35
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Describe this saying,</v>

36
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>when you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers,</v>

37
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back,</v>

38
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>even though faces the wall and nobody will ever see it.</v>

39
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.541
<v Speaker 1>You know it's there,</v>

40
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back for you to sleep</v>

41
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>well at night.</v>

42
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>The aesthetic,</v>

43
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>the quality has to be carried all the way through.</v>

44
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.490
<v Speaker 1>The job's showed an early interest in mechanics and design.</v>

45
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>He did not show early promise in school his mother had taught him to read as a</v>

46
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>toddler,</v>

47
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but he was bored in school and often goofed off a habit that frustrated one</v>

48
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>teacher to the point of bribing him to behave.</v>

49
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>This teacher saw potential in a young jobs and jobs later credited Mrs Hill with</v>

50
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 1>being one of the saints of his life jobs,</v>

51
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>so excels in that fourth grade class with Mrs Hill.</v>

52
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>She skipped him over the fifth grade,</v>

53
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 1>entirely anti headed straight for the middle school.</v>

54
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>This jump ahead though,</v>

55
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty tough for him.</v>

56
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Initially he was bullied and he became a bit of a loan out.</v>

57
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

58
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>he disliked middle school so much that he told his parents that if he couldn't</v>

59
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:20.260
<v Speaker 1>switch schools,</v>

60
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.370
<v Speaker 1>he would just stop going to school altogether in order to keep jobs in school.</v>

61
00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>The family moved from mountain view to last Alsace and jobs that settled into</v>

62
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 1>the COUPA Tino school district.</v>

63
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.881
<v Speaker 1>It was here.</v>

64
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>The team met and befriended Bill Fernandez and other students interested in</v>

65
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Electronics Fernandez.</v>

66
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:36.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 1>he later played a critical role in the creation of apple computers when he</v>

68
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>introduced jobs to his neighbor,</v>

69
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>another electronics aficionados,</v>

70
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>and Bob,</v>

71
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>somebody might've heard of his name was Steve Wozniak.</v>

72
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:47.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and we've actually got more on him on surprisingly.</v>

74
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.523
<v Speaker 1>You get a minute?</v>

75
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

76
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>by the time he entered high school.</v>

77
00:03:02.251 --> 00:03:02.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:06.810
<v Speaker 1>jobs he was already working at Hewlett Packard were to cold call to the CEO job</v>

79
00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:07.380
<v Speaker 1>offer,</v>

80
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but while he was in high school,</v>

81
00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:09.530
<v Speaker 1>his interests well,</v>

82
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 1>they began to diversify a desk.</v>

83
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Jobs discovered a love for the classics and Literature in general,</v>

84
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare,</v>

85
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

86
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>his particular favorites during his senior year jobs was so excelling in English</v>

87
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>that he was able to take classes at Stanford.</v>

88
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.910
<v Speaker 1>When it came time to attend those jobs,</v>

89
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 1>opted to attend state and Oregon,</v>

90
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.470
<v Speaker 1>but well that didn't really last very long.</v>

91
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.480
<v Speaker 1>After only one semester jobs.</v>

92
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>His previous versions,</v>

93
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>he formal education reared its head and he dropped out.</v>

94
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.540
<v Speaker 1>He continued dropping in on classes that interested in,</v>

95
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't adding any credits and he wasn't paying for anything.</v>

96
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

97
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.860
<v Speaker 1>one of these classes that he dropped into when a greatly affected his future,</v>

98
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>this is something that he actually explained in his famous 2005 Stanford</v>

99
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>commencement address something by the way,</v>

100
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:50.760
<v Speaker 1>which is well worth watching.</v>

101
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.820
<v Speaker 1>If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college,</v>

102
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 1>the Mac would have never had multiple type faces or proportionately space fonts.</v>

103
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like being a college dropout.</v>

104
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Jobs was able to secure a job with Atari computers in 1974.</v>

105
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>He works as a tack assisting the engineers who were doing the heavy duty coding</v>

106
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:17.550
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

107
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.001
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

108
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>dead and tablet,</v>

109
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:19.910
<v Speaker 1>lots of money at the time,</v>

110
00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 1>and he was trying to scrape funds together to travel to India to study eastern</v>

111
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

112
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.721
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>

113
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>here's interesting things outside of technology,</v>

114
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:28.740
<v Speaker 1>but it stuck around the of Atari.</v>

115
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Neil bushnell years later said he thought jobs might've been saving money by</v>

116
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:34.320
<v Speaker 1>actually living in the office.</v>

117
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about this,</v>

118
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>but I think Steve was actually living there,</v>

119
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:39.870
<v Speaker 1>so people used to complain that he didn't smell that well.</v>

120
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd come in on the weekends and it'd be there.</v>

121
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd come in late at night and to be there at the time as it's already also</v>

122
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 1>marked a key points in the friendship between jobs and his old friend.</v>

123
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Steve wasn't the AG jobs,</v>

124
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>was assigned to design a circuit board for the video.</v>

125
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Game breakouts until you approached,</v>

126
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>wasn't act to help because Atari was offering a bonus if it could be designed</v>

127
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:58.050
<v Speaker 1>using fewer chips.</v>

128
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Jobs also needed.</v>

129
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.380
<v Speaker 1>The project's completed as in only four days.</v>

130
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>What jobs didn't tell it was New York was the detory had offered jobs in large</v>

131
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>bonus for using fewer chips,</v>

132
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>a bonus jobs received and capturing himself even though wasn't he acted the</v>

133
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>majority of the work.</v>

134
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.560
<v Speaker 1>When wasn't he?</v>

135
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I found out about this like 10 years later.</v>

136
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>He's reported to have cried,</v>

137
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a.</v>

138
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.371
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know of.</v>

139
00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Jobs is deceased at the time of the teeth.</v>

140
00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 1>They consider you to experimenting with technology together,</v>

141
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.300
<v Speaker 1>but there was a point where they're tinkering was put on hold because jobs is</v>

142
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:27.420
<v Speaker 1>living in the office and finally saved enough money to travel to India.</v>

143
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.650
<v Speaker 1>He went to India in search of spiritual enlightenment is something that was</v>

144
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:33.810
<v Speaker 1>rather than the fashion in the sixties and seventies.</v>

145
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.660
<v Speaker 1>He did this trip on an incredibly tight budgets.</v>

146
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 1>He slept on the street.</v>

147
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.250
<v Speaker 1>He sweated on crowded buses and he ate the bad minimum.</v>

148
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He always seems to be some pretty sketchy food,</v>

149
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.790
<v Speaker 1>reportedly getting dysentery and losing 40 pounds.</v>

150
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>During this time.</v>

151
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.990
<v Speaker 1>He was also meditating and learning about Zen Buddhism.</v>

152
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.250
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to go to Tibet,</v>

153
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's after it's traveler's checks were stolen.</v>

154
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>He decided to head back home to the united.</v>

155
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.311
<v Speaker 1>When he got back home,</v>

156
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>he continued meditation as well as another habit had picked up that would be the</v>

157
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:04.530
<v Speaker 1>use of psychedelic drugs jobs.</v>

158
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>He was a big fan of Lsd,</v>

159
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.330
<v Speaker 1>drug trade in college,</v>

160
00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>and would credit with expanding his creativity and vision of the world.</v>

161
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Taking lsd was a profound experience.</v>

162
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important things in my life.</v>

163
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>LSD shows you.</v>

164
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>There's another side to the coin and you can't remember it when it wears off,</v>

165
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>but you know it.</v>

166
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It reinforced my sense of what was important.</v>

167
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Creating great things instead of making money,</v>

168
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as</v>

169
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>much as I could.</v>

170
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Back in the United States jobs had no money and lived in his parent's tool shed</v>

171
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.340
<v Speaker 1>that he had converted into a bedroom.</v>

172
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.600
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't yet continued to work on computers with jobs convincing Wazniak</v>

173
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.900
<v Speaker 1>there's at least one of the early products were sellable,</v>

174
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>wasn't market built.</v>

175
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>A product known as a blue box that could mimic the tones of a telephone system</v>

176
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and essentially trick iphone into making a free long distance call with</v>

177
00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:04.741
<v Speaker 1>technology today,</v>

178
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:07.350
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really think twice about calling someone on the other side of the</v>

179
00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:07.830
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

180
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.030
<v Speaker 1>but in the 19 seventies,</v>

181
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.110
<v Speaker 1>this was a big deal.</v>

182
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.531
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

183
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:11.341
<v Speaker 1>as you might've guessed,</v>

184
00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:11.581
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

185
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 1>these blue boxes were totally illegal,</v>

186
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but they did still sell well.</v>

187
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

188
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.711
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs,</v>

189
00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:20.460
<v Speaker 1>his first business was absolutely selling illegal devices that allowed you to</v>

190
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:22.410
<v Speaker 1>make long distance phone calls for free.</v>

191
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.681
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

192
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the next brain child,</v>

193
00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the cats,</v>

194
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 1>it was much more legitimate.</v>

196
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a product that would become the apple one.</v>

197
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>In 1976 jobs suggested selling it and he and wasn't officially started apple</v>

198
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:34.974
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>

199
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.810
<v Speaker 1>The company was first granted out of jobs,</v>

200
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Speaker 1>his parents garage,</v>

201
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 1>and most of their customers,</v>

202
00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:40.950
<v Speaker 1>they will hobbyists well enough,</v>

203
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>computer hobbyists sweat,</v>

204
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.310
<v Speaker 1>laying out money for the apple one that jobs and Wozniak,</v>

205
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

206
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:46.050
<v Speaker 1>they had cash in their pockets.</v>

207
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Jobs began searching for investors and wasn't he?</v>

208
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.480
<v Speaker 1>He kept designing in 1977,</v>

209
00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>which was just one year after the company launched,</v>

210
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>they put out a new version of their computer called the apple two.</v>

211
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 1>This time there's had color graphics and was much more user friendly allowing it</v>

212
00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:03.120
<v Speaker 1>to be used outside of just the hobbyist market.</v>

213
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 1>They sold $3,000,000 of the apple two in their first year alone,</v>

214
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but this figure,</v>

215
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it was about to become dwarfed.</v>

216
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Two years later they had sold $200,</v>

217
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:13.680
<v Speaker 1>million dollars worth,</v>

218
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

219
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.310
<v Speaker 1>this seemingly huge number was about to be dwarfed.</v>

220
00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Yet again in 1988,</v>

221
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 1>only four years after that launch jobs in wasn't the act.</v>

222
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.800
<v Speaker 1>They went public.</v>

223
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.110
<v Speaker 1>By the end of Apple's first day of public trading,</v>

224
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 1>the company was worth an astounding one.</v>

225
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Point $2,000,000,000.</v>

226
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs was only 25 years old</v>

227
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.710
<v Speaker 1>during the nascent years at apple jobs was dealing with much personal turmoil.</v>

228
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 1>His long time on again off again,</v>

229
00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:52.230
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend Sam Brennan had moved in with him and while she got pregnant,</v>

230
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>us was by all accounts not really thrilled about news,</v>

231
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:55.971
<v Speaker 1>he lays,</v>

232
00:08:55.971 --> 00:08:56.804
<v Speaker 1>started Brennan.</v>

233
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I never wanted to ask that you guys an abortion.</v>

234
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to do that.</v>

235
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Brendan had been offered a job at apple,</v>

236
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but given jobs his reaction to her pregnancy,</v>

237
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>she did not want to take it.</v>

238
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>She left him and that house and began working as a cleaner despite asking for</v>

239
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>support from jobs.</v>

240
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>He did not provide any support.</v>

241
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:14.514
<v Speaker 1>Forest Charles,</v>

242
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>until a paternity tests confirmed that he wants the father even then,</v>

243
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>despite his company being worth over a billion dollars,</v>

244
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>he was only required to provide $500 a month in child support.</v>

245
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Just like these are problems,</v>

246
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Lisa and jobs eventually reconciles and Lisa or even lived with jobs during your</v>

247
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.323
<v Speaker 1>high school years.</v>

248
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 1>She then attended Harvard and today she works as a writer in New York City,</v>

249
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>though it's again,</v>

250
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.461
<v Speaker 1>yes to admit it.</v>

251
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Jobs actually named one of apple's early products after his daughter,</v>

252
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but at least it can be used it.</v>

253
00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't as successful as the apple two had been this failure.</v>

254
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>It was followed by another,</v>

255
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>the apple three,</v>

256
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>which again failed to live up to expectations and it's not just the jobs as</v>

257
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>

258
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.490
<v Speaker 1>but everyone's.</v>

259
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Despite apple being jobs,</v>

260
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>his company,</v>

261
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it was public meant that the apple board had the power to oust him</v>

262
00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:07.070
<v Speaker 1>as CEO.</v>

263
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

264
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.130
<v Speaker 1>we did just actually in 1983,</v>

265
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.240
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really fire him.</v>

266
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.130
<v Speaker 1>They just sent him to Siberia.</v>

267
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Not Literally Siberia of course,</v>

268
00:10:14.991 --> 00:10:18.740
<v Speaker 1>but the office he went to was referred to you with Siberia because it was so out</v>

269
00:10:18.741 --> 00:10:20.690
<v Speaker 1>of the way that it was basically exile.</v>

270
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

271
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>most apple employees,</v>

272
00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:23.720
<v Speaker 1>they were probably pleased to see him go.</v>

273
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.610
<v Speaker 1>He was notoriously difficult to deal with and to former apple employee described</v>

274
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.921
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

275
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:32.921
<v Speaker 1>his attitude toward work as richmond spike character assassination in 1985 when</v>

276
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.340
<v Speaker 1>he was tired of hanging out in Siberia and decided to leave the company that he</v>

277
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:39.850
<v Speaker 1>had founded and start a brand new one,</v>

278
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.820
<v Speaker 1>or has it been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating</v>

279
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.320
<v Speaker 1>drops out of this experience.</v>

280
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I even thought about running away from the valley,</v>

281
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>but something slowly began to dawn on me.</v>

282
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I still loved what I did and so I decided to start over.</v>

283
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.560
<v Speaker 1>He started next computer company which brought its first product to market in</v>

284
00:10:57.561 --> 00:10:58.460
<v Speaker 1>1988.</v>

285
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.670
<v Speaker 1>That can be to the price tag of $10,000 a price way higher than most consumers</v>

286
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:05.354
<v Speaker 1>were willing to pay.</v>

287
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>

288
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it did not sell well.</v>

289
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.160
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't a good style for jobs,</v>

290
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>this fledgling company,</v>

291
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.720
<v Speaker 1>and so we decided to shift the company to building software</v>

292
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.930
<v Speaker 1>with jobs is focused when it was drawn elsewhere towards something rather</v>

293
00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:29.860
<v Speaker 1>unusual fandom.</v>

294
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.910
<v Speaker 1>And that was the movies.</v>

295
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.900
<v Speaker 1>In 1986,</v>

296
00:11:31.901 --> 00:11:35.620
<v Speaker 1>he bought Pixar from George Lucas as part of his dream that his company job has</v>

297
00:11:35.621 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be responsible for the first movie done entirely with computer</v>

298
00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:39.880
<v Speaker 1>animation.</v>

299
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.260
<v Speaker 1>It took four years,</v>

300
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.690
<v Speaker 1>but eventually you achieved that dream well,</v>

301
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.290
<v Speaker 1>that movie,</v>

302
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.190
<v Speaker 1>it was toy story.</v>

303
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It was released in November of 1995 and it became a favorite film for both kids</v>

304
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:50.584
<v Speaker 1>and adults.</v>

305
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.460
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

306
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 1>it maintains a perfect one percent score on rotten tomatoes.</v>

307
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 1>A year after the release of Toy story,</v>

308
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it was even better news jobs took pixar public and didn't something of a Deja Vu</v>

309
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

310
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 1>His shares were worth $1,000,000,000 after the first day of trading,</v>

311
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 1>the first day of trading,</v>

312
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

313
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.101
<v Speaker 1>it was the first thing,</v>

314
00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the string of good days for jobs.</v>

315
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after Pixar winds public,</v>

316
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.040
<v Speaker 1>apple put out the welcoming mat for Steve Jobs to return.</v>

317
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 1>When he returned to apple in 1997,</v>

318
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>the company was operating at a loss and they needed jobs,</v>

319
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>his vision and drive back at the helm.</v>

320
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Apple also announced that they were struggling next computer company turning a</v>

321
00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>previous failure of jobs into a success</v>

322
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.600
<v Speaker 1>jobs he triumphantly return to the company that he had founded.</v>

323
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.260
<v Speaker 1>The company wanted him to bring apple to the forefront of the personal computer</v>

324
00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:45.980
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

325
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Within months of his return jobs,</v>

326
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.130
<v Speaker 1>he was named CEO.</v>

327
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.810
<v Speaker 1>He paid himself a salary of one,</v>

328
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:52.670
<v Speaker 1>$1 a year and didn't exchange,</v>

329
00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:56.000
<v Speaker 1>brought both business acumen and creative design ideas to the company.</v>

330
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.690
<v Speaker 1>He negotiated a financial deal with Microsoft that brought apple the cashflow</v>

331
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.560
<v Speaker 1>that it needed to stay afloat while also helping Microsoft avoid the perception</v>

332
00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:04.610
<v Speaker 1>that they were a monopoly.</v>

333
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Then he envisioned the big idea that helped bring apple back to profitability in</v>

334
00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:08.894
<v Speaker 1>its own right,</v>

335
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.130
<v Speaker 1>and that was the Imac.</v>

336
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.180
<v Speaker 1>It was in 1998 that apple released the brightly colored eggs shape to desktop</v>

337
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:15.500
<v Speaker 1>computer called the Imac,</v>

338
00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and the Imac is even still made today,</v>

339
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>although it looks rather different from the Imac forward applicant jobs,</v>

340
00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:22.430
<v Speaker 1>they just kind to miss.</v>

341
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.030
<v Speaker 1>They revolutionized the way people listen to music in 2001 with the Ipod,</v>

342
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.270
<v Speaker 1>and then the way they communicated in 2007 with the iphone,</v>

343
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.140
<v Speaker 1>and then they were pioneers in the tablet market with the 2010 release.</v>

344
00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:35.060
<v Speaker 1>If the eyepatch job has one set of apple,</v>

345
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.960
<v Speaker 1>we started out to get a computer in the hands of everyday people and we</v>

346
00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Speaker 1>succeeded beyond our wildest dreams today.</v>

347
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

348
00:13:42.771 --> 00:13:46.010
<v Speaker 1>it's nearly impossible to walk down the street without seeing someone with an</v>

349
00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:49.490
<v Speaker 1>apple made device in their hands and through all these years of professional</v>

350
00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:50.060
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

351
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.370
<v Speaker 1>jobs still found the time to focus on his family.</v>

352
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.630
<v Speaker 1>In 1986,</v>

353
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.320
<v Speaker 1>his adoptive mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and this the first time</v>

354
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.981
<v Speaker 1>prompted jobs.</v>

355
00:13:57.981 --> 00:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>His interest in his biological parents when his adoptive mother passed away,</v>

356
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.040
<v Speaker 1>jobs spoke to his father about contacting his birth.</v>

357
00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Parents whose names he had on documents from his parents' job has minutes,</v>

358
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.540
<v Speaker 1>both his birth mother,</v>

359
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:09.081
<v Speaker 1>Joanna shy,</v>

360
00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:09.410
<v Speaker 1>bold,</v>

361
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.540
<v Speaker 1>that is biological sister Mona Simpson.</v>

362
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after his adoptive mother died,</v>

363
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.691
<v Speaker 1>Chicagoland and jobs.</v>

364
00:14:14.691 --> 00:14:16.940
<v Speaker 1>His birth father had divorced in 1962.</v>

365
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.080
<v Speaker 1>When the Syrian migrants opted you return to Syria after earning his phd,</v>

366
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>when jobs was introduced to Mona,</v>

367
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.890
<v Speaker 1>she was still searching for their father.</v>

368
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Jobs joined her in the search and what they found out,</v>

369
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.790
<v Speaker 1>what it was quite surprising.</v>

370
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.480
<v Speaker 1>The father,</v>

371
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>while he was not in Syria,</v>

372
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.590
<v Speaker 1>working in academia rather that father was living in California and is running a</v>

373
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:35.420
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>

374
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly jobs said he had met the man,</v>

375
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 1>are identifying as their father had even shaken his hands and turned in his</v>

376
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.200
<v Speaker 1>restaurants,</v>

377
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.510
<v Speaker 1>but you'd never known he was his father jobs,</v>

378
00:14:44.511 --> 00:14:47.930
<v Speaker 1>though he had no interest in getting to know his father as it goes into the no</v>

379
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>his mother and Mona explaining his decision by saying it a little bit about him</v>

380
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't like what I learned.</v>

381
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

382
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was his birth family jobs also decided to start a family of his own.</v>

383
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>In 1989 jobs,</v>

384
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:02.270
<v Speaker 1>gave a lecture at Stanford Business School and he was riveted by a woman in the</v>

385
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.104
<v Speaker 1>front row.</v>

386
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 1>She was right there in the front row in the lecture hall and I couldn't take my</v>

387
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 1>eyes off her.</v>

388
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I kept losing my train of thought and started feeling a little giddy.</v>

389
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the feeding that jobs described when he first met Laurene Powell Powell</v>

390
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 1>was an mba students at Stanford and struck up a conversation with her after the</v>

391
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>

392
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 1>He invited her out to dinner that night and the two they began.</v>

393
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:26.390
<v Speaker 1>A romantic relationship is Zen Buddhist monk presided over the wedding ceremony</v>

394
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:28.700
<v Speaker 1>at Yosemite National Park in 1991,</v>

395
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and over the next seven years,</v>

396
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the couple had three children.</v>

397
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 1>They remained married until jobs his death in 2011.</v>

398
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>

399
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.210
<v Speaker 1>All of these successes of the early years of the 21st century jobs was not free</v>

400
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:52.470
<v Speaker 1>from worry and well,</v>

401
00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:53.700
<v Speaker 1>neither was apple computers.</v>

402
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.130
<v Speaker 1>In 2003 jobs received the news,</v>

403
00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:56.964
<v Speaker 1>all of us dread.</v>

404
00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>She had cancer,</v>

405
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.740
<v Speaker 1>his doctors and found a cancerous tumor in his pancreas and operable.</v>

406
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.270
<v Speaker 1>It was a rare form of cancer,</v>

407
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:03.961
<v Speaker 1>well jobs.</v>

408
00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:07.410
<v Speaker 1>He refused to listen to his doctors and to have an operation right away.</v>

409
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

410
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.840
<v Speaker 1>he opted to explore other options,</v>

411
00:16:09.841 --> 00:16:14.700
<v Speaker 1>namely veganism and acupuncture in 2004 with these alternative methods not</v>

412
00:16:14.701 --> 00:16:15.720
<v Speaker 1>improving his condition.</v>

413
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Job's opted to have the Cima surgically removed.</v>

414
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Several cancer specialists have since said that that period of waiting may have</v>

415
00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:22.321
<v Speaker 1>cost jobs,</v>

416
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:24.750
<v Speaker 1>years of his life in 2005 jobs,</v>

417
00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:28.890
<v Speaker 1>gave a commencement address at Stanford University that frankly and poignantly</v>

418
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.250
<v Speaker 1>discussed his thoughts on life and death now that you have to confront them at a</v>

419
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:36.330
<v Speaker 1>head on the 15 minute speech reflectors on three moments in his life that helped</v>

420
00:16:36.331 --> 00:16:40.020
<v Speaker 1>him get to where he was in telling those stories and part of the message the</v>

422
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.630
<v Speaker 1>To do what you love,</v>

423
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.720
<v Speaker 1>remember you are going to die and to trust your inner voice.</v>

424
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever</v>

425
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 3>encountered to help me make the big choices in life.</v>

426
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.590
<v Speaker 3>Because almost everything,</v>

427
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 3>all external expectations,</v>

428
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.950
<v Speaker 3>all pride,</v>

429

<v Speaker 3>all fear of embarrassment or failure.</v>

430
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 3>These things just fall away in the face of death.</v>

431
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Leaving only what is truly important,</v>

432
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 3>remembering that you were going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap</v>

433
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 3>of thinking you have something to lose.</v>

434
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.930
<v Speaker 3>You are already naked.</v>

435
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 3>There is no reason not to follow your heart.</v>

436
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.160

443
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.650
<v Speaker 1>and a stark reminder of our limited time on earth.</v>

444
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a speech that truly every human can relate to given by a man whose mind</v>

449
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 1>He was grading and just didn't seem healthy.</v>

450
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.260
<v Speaker 1>The company continued to explain this away off the questions were raised.</v>
