00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>She has one of the earliest serial killers in recorded history.</v>

2
00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>The original sadomasochistic femme fatale.</v>

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>She stands out as a shocking lesson in just down dangerous.</v>

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:10.344
<v Speaker 1>The sadistic,</v>

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.263
<v Speaker 1>demented,</v>

6
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>powerful women can be the passing of the centuries has left us with an</v>

7
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>incomplete picture of the true nature of our crimes,</v>

8
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>but what we do know is truly stomach Channing and this week's biographics.</v>

9
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>We pair into the depraved life of the blood count tests.</v>

10
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth battery.</v>

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>The women we know is Elizabeth Bathory.</v>

13
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:45.631
<v Speaker 1>It was born as early a bit Bathory on August the seventh 1560 in nearby store in</v>

14
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of Hungary.</v>

15
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>She was born into one of the most prominent families in central Europe.</v>

16
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.951
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

17
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>she was lavished with the very best education in classical upbringing.</v>

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>During our formative years,</v>

19
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>she learned to speak Hungarian,</v>

20
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Slovak,</v>

21
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Greek,</v>

22
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>

23
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and German.</v>

24
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth was a child with severe health problems.</v>

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Historians have speculated that the fact that her parents were first cousins may</v>

26
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:10.771
<v Speaker 1>have contributed to how weak constitution she was an epileptic and as such was</v>

27
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>prone to violence,</v>

28
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:12.664
<v Speaker 1>seizures.</v>

29
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>It has been recorded that young Elizabeth was exposed to all sorts of horrific</v>

30
00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>atrocities during her formative years.</v>

31
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 1>She has said to have begun laughing at the site of a man who's crime was</v>

32
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>stealing being soon into the body of a horse.</v>

33
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>She would also regularly witness the severe beatings of servants unlike other</v>

34
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:30.561
<v Speaker 1>young girls.</v>

35
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>So Elizabeth was not offended by the violence that she saw.</v>

36
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.690
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

37
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>she seemed to be drawn to it.</v>

38
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 10 she had become a rather stunningly beautiful young lady.</v>

39
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It was then that she became engaged to a 15 year old Hungarian counts by the</v>

40
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>name of fairing can Nadasky as was the custom sheet,</v>

41
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>moved into our future husbands,</v>

42
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>parents palace and received education.</v>

43
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Then running the estates that were under the control of her mother and yeah,</v>

44
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Legend has it that Elizabeth had an affair with a hasn't bought,</v>

45
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>early teens and became pregnant.</v>

47
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>It is said that she gave the child away secretly.</v>

48
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

49
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Aaron's is supposed to have discovered the affair,</v>

50
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>had the peasants castrated and then thrown to a pack of wild dogs.</v>

51
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Whether this story is true or not,</v>

52
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>it is clear that Elizabeth was active sexually.</v>

53
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>She married Ferenc on May the eighth 1574 when she was 14 the wedding,</v>

54
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>it was an extravagance of fair with four and a half thousand people in</v>

55
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>attendance.</v>

56
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>The party raged on for three days at the height of which parents gifted his wife</v>

57
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>with a castle of her own.</v>

58
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It just so happens to be causal trash tits out,</v>

59
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the darkest,</v>

60
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 1>most bleakly gothic castle in all of Hungary.</v>

61
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.600
<v Speaker 1>The car situations in the literal Carpathians and modern day Slovakia.</v>

62
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>We're surrounded by a village and farmland.</v>

63
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>It would come to be the scene of many of our most horrific crimes,</v>

64
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 1>the marriage at United to powerful families,</v>

65
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>and it made them the power couple of the day.</v>

66
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>For the first few years,</v>

67
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth was busy learning about and overseeing the many estates that she</v>

68
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>controls.</v>

69
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Her husband was off fighting against the Ottomans.</v>

70
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>He proved to be a great warrior,</v>

71
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.551
<v Speaker 1>noting himself.</v>

72
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>The nickname of the black knight of Hungary is absolute brutality in the face of</v>

73
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>the enemy.</v>

74
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Terrified his enemies since shocked his allies.</v>

75
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>The Turks invaded Hungary in 1591 precipitating what had become known as the</v>

76
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:20.531
<v Speaker 1>long war,</v>

77
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:25.531
<v Speaker 1>which lasted from 1593 to 1606 the wall was to drag on severely depleting the</v>

78
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian economy.</v>

79
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

80
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Bathory never felt the pinch because a husband kept showering her with</v>

81
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>gifts from the Ottoman Empire.</v>

82
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.871
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

83
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>a couple of groups so wealthy that during this time they actually lends money,</v>

84
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>do the Hungarian Habsburg Empire to keep the country a flute.</v>

85
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>During the war years cashed it set was threatened by the tax.</v>

86
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth had to defend her husband's estate since she did so effectively at</v>

87
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:49.351
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

88
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Street also gave refuge to desperate peasants feeding and housing them.</v>

89
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Over the first few years of their marriage.</v>

90
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth and foreigns didn't spend much time together.</v>

91
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>When they did it said they bonded over their love of violence.</v>

92
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Torturing young servant girls see were under their charge.</v>

93
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Ferentz taught his teenage wife innovative methods of torture such as rolling up</v>

94
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>pieces of oils,</v>

95
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>

96
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>placing it in between the toes of a seven girl and then setting it on fire.</v>

97
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>It was also claims that he gave Elizabeth the Claude Glove for her to scratch up</v>

98
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>the faces of disobedient girls.</v>

99
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt that a husband introduced Elizabeth Duke or manner of</v>

100
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:24.844
<v Speaker 1>atrocity,</v>

101
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>but there was another evil influence in 1601 the household was joined by a</v>

102
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>strange woman by the name of Anna Doll Volya.</v>

103
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It was rumored that she was a witch.</v>

104
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>What is undeniable though,</v>

105
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 1>is that Elizabeth's personality underwear.</v>

106
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a dramatic change from the time the Darboy.</v>

107
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

108
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>and to the household.</v>

109
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>She became much more sadistic,</v>

110
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.220
<v Speaker 1>whereas the husband taught her to torture Anna towards her to kill.</v>

111
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Under the sinister to Jovana,</v>

112
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth was responsible for the deaths of several of her servants.</v>

113
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:00.984
<v Speaker 1>Around this time,</v>

114
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.940
<v Speaker 1>the disappearances of the girls raised new eyebrows as peasants were completely</v>

115
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>disposable at that time and place.</v>

116
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Any questions that were raised by family members were squelched quickly by</v>

117
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.870
<v Speaker 1>virtue of the huge power that the battery family hat Elizabeth was in all</v>

118
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>practical tans untouchable.</v>

119
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>She could torture and kill to our heart's delight.</v>

120
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Even the power of the family though could not prevent the reamers.</v>

121
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Local pastors became increasingly suspicious.</v>

122
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:29.940
<v Speaker 1>There's Elizabeth more frequently asked them to come to the castle to perform a</v>

123
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 1>funeral rites for serving girls who had apparently died of cholera.</v>

124
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It is recorded that one priest,</v>

125
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:37.380
<v Speaker 1>after having attended too many funerals,</v>

126
00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 1>pulled her aside and said to her,</v>

127
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.450
<v Speaker 1>your grace should not have acted so because it offends the Lord and we will be</v>

128
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 1>punished if we do not complain to you and criticize your grace,</v>

129
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and in order to find my words aren't true,</v>

130
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:53.250
<v Speaker 1>we need only exume the body and you will find that the marks identify the way in</v>

131
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>which death occurred.</v>

132
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth was outraged that the priest would deck.</v>

133
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>He was there in this Nana.</v>

134
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.580
<v Speaker 1>She threatens that she had powerful relatives.</v>

135
00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>He would not tolerate such talk.</v>

136
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>She then stormed out of the charge,</v>

137
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>leaving it for her husband to smooth things over with the priest together.</v>

138
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>The murderous couple had five known children with the youngest being born in</v>

139
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 1>1598 around 60 no one Elizabeth's husband ferrets became unwell.</v>

140
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the specific nature of his condition,</v>

141
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but it led to paralysis.</v>

142
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>If the legs,</v>

143
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.200
<v Speaker 1>he died in 1604 bringing their 29 year marriage to an ends at the time of her</v>

144
00:06:25.201 --> 00:06:26.034
<v Speaker 1>husband's death.</v>

145
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Elisabeth was 44 years of age.</v>

146
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.120
<v Speaker 1>The loss of her husband cost another noticeable change,</v>

147
00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:40.690
<v Speaker 1>and Elizabeth Sevens notice that she became even more sadistic.</v>

148
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.770
<v Speaker 1>The stress of having to take the reigns of an extensive Ambar was no doubt a</v>

149
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 1>contributing factor.</v>

150
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 1>It appears that she now transformed our pension for sadism from a hobby into a</v>

151
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.330
<v Speaker 1>full time preoccupation,</v>

152
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.360
<v Speaker 1>specifically Eby torture and murder of young women with almost 407 girls savor</v>

153
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 1>the banks with our vast remains.</v>

154
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth had no shortage of victims,</v>

155
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.051
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

156
00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:02.771
<v Speaker 1>killing our staff.</v>

157
00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit of a hassle as him and that she had to replace them.</v>

158
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>So she increasingly began to lure girls from the villages surrounding our</v>

159
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:09.934
<v Speaker 1>castles.</v>

160
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 1>When she had had her fill of torturing these unfortunates,</v>

161
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:16.420
<v Speaker 1>they would be flying over the castle walls to be ripped to pieces by wolves.</v>

162
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth built up a loyal team of sycophancy facilitated have murderous</v>

163
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

164
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I know Delvoye.</v>

165
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Was her main accomplice also brought into these statistics cycle?</v>

167
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Was the nurse who looked after the children,</v>

168
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>a woman by the name of a year and a Joe.</v>

169
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>There was also a friend of hers involved by the name of [inaudible].</v>

170
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>There was also a washer woman by the name of Katelyn,</v>

171
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>the most sinister of the helpers,</v>

172
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Anna and darker,</v>

173
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>who would try to outdo each other and inflicting pain on their victims.</v>

174
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>The youngest of the murderous clan was a disfigured team by the name of fit</v>

175
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:53.284
<v Speaker 1>Skyrim.</v>

176
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>The typical progression of a seven girl into this horror would begin with a</v>

177
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>simple mistake and the performance of her duties.</v>

178
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 1>This could be as menial as missing a stitch,</v>

179
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>the counts as if she was present with fixing evil,</v>

180
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 1>stare on the girl,</v>

181
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.201
<v Speaker 1>yell at her,</v>

182
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>and then begin snapping her arounds.</v>

183
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.821
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth,</v>

184
00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:09.370
<v Speaker 1>the device,</v>

185
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.840
<v Speaker 1>all manner of creative punishments to go with specific misdemeanors and eagles</v>

186
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>who made a mistake in any kind of sewing would be stabbed repeatedly with it.</v>

187
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Long sewing needles.</v>

188
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Usually girls would be stripped naked before they were tortured.</v>

189
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth reveled in inflicting psychological torture on the victims after</v>

190
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>sticking to needles into the fingers of a girl.</v>

191
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.164
<v Speaker 1>She would comment,</v>

192
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>if it hurts the whore,</v>

193
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>she can pull it out.</v>

194
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 1>The girl would naturally take,</v>

195
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>this is permission to pull the needle out.</v>

196
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>But when she did,</v>

197
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth would pull out a knife and cut the finger off.</v>

198
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 1>She was also known to have at least one occasion bitten a chunk of flesh from</v>

199
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>the face of one of her victims.</v>

200
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Services would be lucky to get away with a lost finger or two.</v>

201
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>More often than not,</v>

202
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:54.290
<v Speaker 1>the blood lust within the deprived heart of the Countess was unable to be</v>

203
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>quelled.</v>

204
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.180
<v Speaker 1>The girls would be dragged off to a torture chamber where Elizabeth employee to</v>

205
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>torture squad to carry out much of her daddy work.</v>

206
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>All manner of implements were made you soft cause the most gruesome afflictions</v>

207
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>imaginable.</v>

208
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Pins says we used to rip flesh insides were torn out and there there've even</v>

209
00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>been reports that cannibalism was enforced on some of the girls.</v>

210
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>We know certain details of what took place in the torture chambers of the</v>

211
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>battery castles because of investigation and trial transcripts that occurred</v>

212
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>when face eventually caught up with Elizabeth Bathory in our accomplices.</v>

213
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

214
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>over the centuries the legends took over and many of the crimes attributed to</v>

215
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

216
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:29.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

217
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Fiction.</v>

218
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most pervasive belief is that she had blood drained from virgins and</v>

219
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>would bathe in us in order to preserve her youthful beauty.</v>

220
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 1>This story is almost certainly,</v>

221
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've not one of these seven girls who've testified against bathroom.</v>

222
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>He mentioned anything to do with the practice rather accounts after accounts</v>

223
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:50.550
<v Speaker 1>mentions that the floors of the torture chambers were covered in blood,</v>

224
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 1>which they would then have to clean up.</v>

225
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>The counters showed absolutely no interest in preserving the blood as part of</v>

226
00:09:56.431 --> 00:10:01.350
<v Speaker 1>some narcissistic beauty regime by 1609 the rumors of what we're taking place at</v>

227
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>the battery castles were rife,</v>

228
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing the law could do to put a stop to it.</v>

229
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.751
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

230
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>peasants were unable to bring charges against nobles.</v>

231
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Some parents even looked at the demented counters as a source of ready revenue</v>

232
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 1>selling their children to have for a lump sum on the face of it,</v>

233
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 1>the trade was made to provide seven duties,</v>

234
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but if the child was to die of cholera,</v>

235
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>what of it Elizabeth?</v>

236
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Appetite for blood was insatiable.</v>

237
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 1>The bodies were piling up at such a rate that how group of enablers web running</v>

238
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 1>out of places to bury them.</v>

239
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Many of the girls were placed in shallow graves and the costs or courtyards,</v>

240
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>and some of them were dug up by hungry dogs by the beginning of 1,609 and this</v>

241
00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:41.020
<v Speaker 1>is what's closest confidant and adopt.</v>

242
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Valia died of a stroke around this same time,</v>

243
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

244
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Debts began to mounts with all of the children grown and married.</v>

245
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:50.190
<v Speaker 1>The counters fell into a spiral of loneliness and depression.</v>

246
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>For some reason,</v>

247
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth decided that she needed to find a better class of victim.</v>

248
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know why,</v>

249
00:10:55.771 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>but the general belief is that a lady steward as the major rover who many</v>

250
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 1>believe to be or which convinced her that if she took the lives of noble girls</v>

251
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 1>how financial fortunes with turn arounds or it may simply have been that she was</v>

252
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>running out of peasant victims.</v>

253
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the reason for the change it led to Elizabeth to the decision to open a</v>

254
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>finishing school for young women.</v>

255
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 1>It would be the perfect cover for her to continue her torture us ways with a</v>

256
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 1>higher class of victim.</v>

257
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.451
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

258
00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>the attendance fees that the parents of the girls paid would infuse some much</v>

259
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.680
<v Speaker 1>needed funds into the battery coffers.</v>

260
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Bye Now as appeared that Elizabeth is insatiable need to kill the young girls</v>

261
00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:42.680
<v Speaker 1>and led to the depths of insanity.</v>

262
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly clouded our reasoning.</v>

263
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious that the aristocratic parents of teenage girls who suddenly</v>

264
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.490
<v Speaker 1>disappeared would move heaven and earth to get to the bottom of what had</v>

265
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>happened to their pride and joy,</v>

266
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>but none of that mattered to Elizabeth.</v>

267
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>All she saw was a ready supply of nubile young bodies.</v>

268
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably the body counts began adding up and the parents came calling</v>

269
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth May dumped the bizarrest of excuses.</v>

270
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the girls had gone crazy and killed the other girls before committing</v>

271
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:10.534
<v Speaker 1>suicide,</v>

272
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>but no one was convinced.</v>

273
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Some parents appeal to the King Mathius the second and he decided to undertake</v>

274
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 1>an investigation.</v>

275
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>The official Raul investigation was put into the hands of the king's highest</v>

276
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:23.610
<v Speaker 1>ranking representative [inaudible].</v>

277
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>This man happened to be one of Elizabeth's dead husband's closest associates on</v>

278
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>his deathbed friends that even asked us to look out for his wife.</v>

279
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.400
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

280
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 1>there's his loyalty to the king was stronger than that of his old friend.</v>

281
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:36.611
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

282
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 1>he treated Elizabeth with a level of respect that she would not have otherwise</v>

283
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>have received that.</v>

284
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>As I began to interview witnesses,</v>

285
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>he soon had dozens of people that you testified to.</v>

286
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>The counters is depraved ways.</v>

287
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.641
<v Speaker 1>Seven zoo,</v>

288
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>it managed to get out of the cost of their lives.</v>

289
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Spoke of seeing blood drenched wools,</v>

290
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>hearing terrible screams and noticing the ever growing readymade cemetery in the</v>

291
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:56.620
<v Speaker 1>castle courtyard.</v>

292
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

293
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 1>none of the people that Thursday spoke to you was an actual eye witness of the</v>

294
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>

295
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Thursday you became convinced of Elizabeth skills.</v>

296
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

297
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>he felt terrible about the pledge that he had made to his dying friends that he</v>

298
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>would account for his widow.</v>

299
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 1>He decided to write,</v>

300
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.650
<v Speaker 1>do Elizabeth's relatives and ask for advice.</v>

301
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 1>A secret agreement was reached by which the as it would be able to complete his</v>

302
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>investigation,</v>

303
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 1>but Elizabeth would never be brought to trial.</v>

304
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>She would go direct need to prison without the embarrassment and the family that</v>

305
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>a public trial would bring.</v>

306
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to note that none of batteries,</v>

307
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 1>relatives argued that she was innocent by December of 16,</v>

308
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:33.230
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

309
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Thursday,</v>

310
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 1>believed that he had enough evidence to arrest Elizabeth,</v>

311
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to make absolutely sure.</v>

312
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

313
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 1>he had himself in the king,</v>

314
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 1>invited to dine at Battery Castle and Elizabeth was forensically nervous,</v>

315
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 1>but she tried to act.</v>

316
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>The gracious hostess things went well until she saved the men.</v>

317
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:49.511
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

318
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>post dinner dessert,</v>

319
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 1>a cake on first divide.</v>

320
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 1>The men began to feel unwell,</v>

321
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.950
<v Speaker 1>convinced that the contest had tried to poison them.</v>

322
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 1>They may just be the accent.</v>

323
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.381
<v Speaker 1>On New Year's Eve,</v>

324
00:13:59.381 --> 00:13:59.861
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

325
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:00.161
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

326
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Thursday returned with a contingent of armed guards.</v>

327
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.160
<v Speaker 1>They had outside the castle gates and wait it before a long Elizabeth and our</v>

328
00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 1>lady Stewart as the major river came out to Costa Protective,</v>

329
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 1>spelled designed to protect the countess and bringing about the death of</v>

330
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>investigator.</v>

331
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>

332
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Thursday one is men listens to the women's incantations.</v>

333
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>When the two went inside,</v>

334
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>the investigators crept towards the is entranceway.</v>

335
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.680
<v Speaker 1>They immediately noticed the mutilated body of a young girl and near the doorway</v>

336
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.100
<v Speaker 1>to more were found just inside.</v>

337
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 1>They then heard the sounds of screaming,</v>

338
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>which led them to the torture chamber.</v>

339
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>It was there that they discovered Elizabeth's murder team harder at work.</v>

340
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It is unclear whether the Thursday actually caught Elizabeth in the act of</v>

341
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>

342
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

343
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>he was now convinced if that guilt,</v>

344
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>the contest was found and taken into custody.</v>

345
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>She immediately claimed their innocence,</v>

346
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.690
<v Speaker 1>blaming everything on her servants.</v>

347
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.111
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

348
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:50.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

349
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.020
<v Speaker 1>wasn't moved.</v>

350
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.411
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

351
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 1>and see through Elizabeth into her own dungeon.</v>

352
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

353
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 1>306 people testified against Elizabeth.</v>

354
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Even the members of her murder grew turned against a incriminating themselves.</v>

355
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:02.084
<v Speaker 1>In the process.</v>

356
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:07.150
<v Speaker 1>The total reported murder counts varies between 80 and 650 batteries.</v>

357
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Accomplices were put on trial in January of 1611 scores of witnesses and even</v>

358
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 1>some surviving victims took to the witness stands.</v>

359
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.290
<v Speaker 1>The judges is also examined some of the cadavers that had been taken from the</v>

360
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>battery consuls death sentences were passed down to I own a Joe Dorko and Fisco.</v>

361
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Prior to their executions I own a Jo Anne Dorko were given that own form of</v>

362
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:27.740
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>

363
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Their fingers were torn out by iron tongs before they were put to death and then</v>

364
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>tossed on a bonfire.</v>

365
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 1>FISCO was spared this torture due to his youth.</v>

366
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Instead it was beheaded and then burns.</v>

367
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Catelynn was the only one who was not put to death.</v>

368
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 1>She had been the most softhearted of the bunch on several occasions.</v>

369
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>She herself had been beaten for sneaking food in for the victims.</v>

370
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 1>She was sentenced to life imprisonment.</v>

371
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.081
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

372
00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I kept his word to Elizabeth and she was never put on trial.</v>

373
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.300
<v Speaker 1>She was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in our own castle.</v>

374
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:06.130
<v Speaker 1>A confined to one of the dungeons which had been the scene of some of her</v>

375
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.810
<v Speaker 1>atrocities are only visitors,</v>

376
00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:10.150
<v Speaker 1>were priests and the man who had put him behind boss.</v>

377
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:15.010
<v Speaker 1>That was like the Kyries reported that she was unrepentant and crazed with rage.</v>

378
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.030
<v Speaker 1>None of the priests was able to get it to acknowledge the severity of our crimes</v>

379
00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:22.000
<v Speaker 1>and she continued to insist that it was a assistance.</v>

380
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Who are the real criminals are priests challenge tower as to why she didn't</v>

381
00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 1>order them to stop.</v>

382
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Speaker 1>She said that she had been afraid of them.</v>

383
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth reserve the greatest animosity for Thursday.</v>

384
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>At one point when he came to see her,</v>

385
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 1>she began to subjects him to an awful harangue at which points and to Jack did.</v>

386
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>You are in the last months of your life.</v>

387
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.780
<v Speaker 1>You do not deserve to breathe the air on the earth or see the light of the Lord.</v>

388
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You shall disappear from this world and never really it again as the shadows and</v>

389
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:49.570
<v Speaker 1>develop you.</v>

390
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.580
<v Speaker 1>May you find time to repent,</v>

391
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.110
<v Speaker 1>you'll be steal life.</v>

392
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Bathory complained to a guard that she had cold hands on October the</v>

393
00:16:57.311 --> 00:17:01.450
<v Speaker 1>21st 1614 he told us to go lie down and tried to get some sleep.</v>

394
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.673
<v Speaker 1>She did,</v>

395
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and she never woke up.</v>

396
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Her body was buried in the cemetery at [inaudible],</v>

397
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:10.660
<v Speaker 1>but it said that it didn't remain there long due to local uproar at the outrage</v>

398
00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:12.940
<v Speaker 1>of having such a murderous buried in their midst.</v>

399
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.390
<v Speaker 1>The body was supposedly exhumed and taken to the battery family,</v>

400
00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Krebs.</v>

401
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.291
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

402
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:20.980
<v Speaker 1>when the crypt was opened in 1995 the corpse of Hungary's most infamous</v>

403
00:17:20.981 --> 00:17:23.860
<v Speaker 1>murderous was nowhere to be seen.</v>

404
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not going to ask if he enjoyed the video,</v>
