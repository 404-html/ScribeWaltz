1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.461
<v Speaker 1>Nine,</v>

2
00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:00.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3
00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>2:00 AM on April the 19th,</v>

4
00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:04.030
<v Speaker 1>1995.</v>

5
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the moments when 27 year old Timothy Mcveigh exploded his way into the U.</v>

6
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>S history books blowing up a gigantic truck bomb outside the Alfred p,</v>

7
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City,</v>

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>the blast and Nylisa,</v>

9
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>the building,</v>

10
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it ended 168 lives,</v>

11
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>including those of 19 children.</v>

12
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>It also sends a shockwave throughout the nation.</v>

13
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>No one could believe such an atrocity was carried out by a fellow American,</v>

14
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>especially one has normal seeming as my cafe.</v>

15
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>it's Mcveigh's consciousness.</v>

17
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It didn't spring from nowhere.</v>

18
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>He was a decorated war veteran,</v>

19
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>a second amendment crusader,</v>

20
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>and a foreign right activist.</v>

21
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>More than that,</v>

22
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>he was a product of his time,</v>

23
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>a monster born from some of the most controversial actions the federal</v>

24
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>government's has ever been involved in acquired loner.</v>

25
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>A bullied kid who never fit in Mugabe was the most average by imaginable.</v>

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>And in the video today,</v>

27
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the story of how that boy became America's deadliest terrorist.</v>

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>If you drive to upstate New York to the town of Pendleton today,</v>

29
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you'll find a small blue collar community identical to a million others across</v>

30
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

31
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no historical market here.</v>

32
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing to commemorate the town that gave birth to Timothy Mcveigh,</v>

33
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>born in nearby lockport on April the 23rd,</v>

34
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.311
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

35
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:32.891
<v Speaker 1>68.</v>

36
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Young Timothy was the middle child in a household that was as boring as it was.</v>

37
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:38.184
<v Speaker 1>Dysfunctional.</v>

38
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>

39
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Bill works endless shifts,</v>

40
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>do support his family,</v>

41
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.761
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

42
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>his mother,</v>

43
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>mickey divided his time between going on the road for work and going on the road</v>

44
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>with other men.</v>

45
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>

46
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Tim would say that he and his as patty and Jennifer,</v>

47
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>so almost nothing of their parents growing up.</v>

48
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Not that the children are isolated,</v>

49
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>good Catholics from Irish stock.</v>

50
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.060
<v Speaker 1>The next phase were fixtures at the local church and generally the sort of lines</v>

51
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd expect from small town.</v>

52
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.783
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's.</v>

53
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>When Mickey finally left in 1978 and took he and Jennifer to live in Florida.</v>

54
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It was just another chapter in that American classic,</v>

55
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>the Great Big Book of suburban misery,</v>

56
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>but 10 year old 10 being left alone with dad,</v>

57
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>bill effectively meant being left entirely alone.</v>

58
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing to do in pendleton and nobody to do it with,</v>

59
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 1>especially not when you were a lanky intelligence and painfully shy boy,</v>

60
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but nobody seemed to understand.</v>

61
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>The only person Tim really connected to in those days was his grandpa.</v>

62
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>The two would go shooting together a rare escape from the beatings that Timothy</v>

63
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>received at school as he entered his teenage years,</v>

64
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the boy mockingly called noodle by his classmates again to develop a vague</v>

65
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>paranoia that the governments might come and take his beloved guns way depriving</v>

66
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>him of this one last escape from this miserable life.</v>

67
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>It was a feeling that he found reflected in the Turner diaries.</v>

68
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.501
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

69
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>if you've never heard of the Turner diaries,</v>

70
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to have a fairly miserable next 30 seconds.</v>

71
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>They were written by a Neo Nazi called William Luther Paris in 1978,</v>

72
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and the book features a white uprising against the Jews and blacks who are</v>

73
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>controlling America.</v>

74
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And it culminates in the whites committing a justified genocide.</v>

75
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

76
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>the diaries is as a textbook definition of racism as you're ever likely to find</v>

77
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>the sort of book Hitler would gobble up for his Nazi breakfast.</v>

78
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Yet it also contains perhaps the key to make these actions.</v>

79
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>In one passage,</v>

80
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>the heroes detonate a truck bomb outside of federal building,</v>

81
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:41.071
<v Speaker 1>killing 800 people for 14 year old timothy reading the Turner diaries was like</v>

82
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>someone had opened his eyes,</v>

83
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>pierced his book,</v>

84
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>taps into the deep paranoia.</v>

85
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>The young boy was already feeling.</v>

86
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>He became a sort of teenage survivalist,</v>

87
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>stockpiling food for a nuclear war that was never commons ramping up his</v>

88
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>defenses of the second amendment.</v>

89
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of teenagers though they go through phases of extremist belief only to</v>

90
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>later turn into completely normal adults.</v>

91
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that almost happened to Timothy,</v>

92
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.830
<v Speaker 1>something of a computer whiz.</v>

93
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>He graduated high school in 1986 with a partial scholarship.</v>

94
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

95
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.140
<v Speaker 1>the boy's life.</v>

96
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It could have taken a permanent turn for the ordinary,</v>

97
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.353
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't.</v>

98
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.321
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

99
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Timothy dropped out after two years of bumming around Pendleton.</v>

100
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>He made the decision that would change his life and the lives of 168 people</v>

101
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>living in Oklahoma City forever.</v>

102
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>He decided to join the army.</v>

103
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

104
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>it was spring of 1988.</v>

105
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:39.680
<v Speaker 1>When mcvay graduated from boot camp,</v>

106
00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I became a paid member of the US military.</v>

107
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Why all accounts?</v>

108
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>It was a model soldier.</v>

109
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>He even managed to make real friends for perhaps the first time in his life,</v>

110
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>pairing up with two guys called Michael Fortier and Terry Nichols like America.</v>

111
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Vein Nichols was a guy from Nowheresville with an absent father like Nichols was</v>

112
00:04:56.281 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>a second amendment advocate with a creeping distrust of the government and like</v>

113
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>make a a Nicole's would soon choose to express that distrust through a horrific</v>

114
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.224
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

115
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into that,</v>

116
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 1>we first got to take a quick trip to the Arabian desert.</v>

117
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>August the second 1990,</v>

118
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and Saddam Hussein's army rolls into Kuwait,</v>

119
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>leaving a trail of horror in its wake.</v>

120
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Ordinary courageous are abducted off the streets,</v>

121
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>tortured to death and their bodies and dumped on their families' lawns.</v>

122
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>Over 400,000 people flee the country.</v>

123
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Faced with a humanitarian catastrophe,</v>

124
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:34.051
<v Speaker 1>george h dot w dot Bush orders the US army to create borders along with them as</v>

125
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Timothy Mcveigh now,</v>

126
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:36.171
<v Speaker 1>a special gunner,</v>

127
00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 1>mcveigh was at the head of a column that rolled into occupied Kuwait on January</v>

128
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.321
<v Speaker 1>the 17th,</v>

129
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>1991.</v>

130
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>He witnessed the fist fighting and the collapse of the Iraqi army firsthand.</v>

131
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

132
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>he fired one of the earliest shots of the war as his column moved into the</v>

133
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>desert and they pulled the trigger on a cannon shot that blue and Iraqi soldiers</v>

134
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>head clean off,</v>

135
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>although he celebrated at the time.</v>

136
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>He later told his official biography is that the image of the men's upper body</v>

137
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>disappearing in a spray of red mist came to haunt him as his platoon march,</v>

138
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 1>north along dusty highways and listed with burns out.</v>

139
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Wreckages have destroyed Iraqi vehicles is celebration.</v>

140
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>It gave way to horror by the time the war ended on February the 28th,</v>

141
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>something inside and they had gone out.</v>

142
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Some vital spark of empathy had gone and it was never to be rekindled.</v>

143
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>The next few months were rough for the decorated soldier,</v>

144
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>absolutely exhausted by the Gulf War.</v>

145
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Mcvay flunked the army special forces training.</v>

146
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>After two days,</v>

147
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>he took an honorable discharge and returned to pendleton where you failed to</v>

148
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>find steady work,</v>

149
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>traumatized and directionless.</v>

150
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>He returns to his one real love guns.</v>

151
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>In 1991,</v>

152
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the gun show Sackett was a place of itinerant wonder is fanatics and didn't</v>

153
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:48.531
<v Speaker 1>things he asks.</v>

154
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>He lived a nomadic existence,</v>

155
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 1>rooming the empty planes of America and hawking their wares.</v>

156
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Mcvay joins that number,</v>

157
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>flogging copies of his childhood favorites.</v>

158
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>The Turner diaries do a receptive antigovernment audience.</v>

159
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>At some point he made contact again with Terry Nichols,</v>

160
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>who left the army on a hardship discharge before the Gulf War.</v>

161
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 1>The two went into business selling army sepsis.</v>

162
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>As they spend more and more time together,</v>

163
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>they fed fuel into the fire of one another's resentment of the government,</v>

164
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 1>but it would be two major events that would turn those smoldering embers into an</v>

165
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic wildfires.</v>

166
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.601
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

167
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Timothy Mcveigh was becoming desensitized to violence in the Arabian desert and</v>

168
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>anonymous man named Randy Weaver was missing his Idaho court date.</v>

169
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>A former green baret weaver had taken his wife,</v>

170
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Vicky and that children and retreated into a tiny survivalist cabin overlooking</v>

171
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Ruby creek in 1989.</v>

172
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.460
<v Speaker 1>ATF agents try to turn them into an format when we ever refused.</v>

173
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:52.000
<v Speaker 1>He was indicted on firearms offenses in February 1991.</v>

174
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 1>He failed to show up at his trial and an arrest warrant was issued on August the</v>

175
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.400
<v Speaker 1>21st 1992 us marshals finally tracked weaver to his cabin.</v>

176
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>As they approached,</v>

177
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.460
<v Speaker 1>we've as dark striker started barking.</v>

178
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen year old Sammy weaver came out of the cabin running with his gun in</v>

179
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

180
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.310
<v Speaker 1>What exactly happened next?</v>

181
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.233
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

182
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.180
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that when the dust cleared striker,</v>

183
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Sammy and Deputy Marshal Bill Degan,</v>

184
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.750
<v Speaker 1>they were all debt.</v>

185
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.960
<v Speaker 1>The FBI laid siege to the cabin on August the 22nd FBI sniper lawn hurry,</v>

186
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.210
<v Speaker 1>cheese shot randy as he tried to check on Sammy body,</v>

187
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.500
<v Speaker 1>randy rand for safety.</v>

188
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And how are you?</v>

189
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Chief?</v>

190
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Find again this time his shot missed the window,</v>

191
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.020
<v Speaker 1>randy as Vicky weaver stepped up to the doorway,</v>

192
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 1>her newborn child in her arms,</v>

193
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but it struck her through her head and she died instantly.</v>

194
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.460
<v Speaker 1>The deaths of Sammy and Vicky waiver.</v>

195
00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:41.670
<v Speaker 1>We're like a lightening bolt to the heart of the guns,</v>

196
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Speaker 1>second from mcveigh and nickels and others like them.</v>

197
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Ruby Ridge was proof that the government was coming for your guns and that kill</v>

198
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 1>your entire family in order to get them.</v>

199
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It was in the shadow of this tragedy that's an even greater and even more</v>

200
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:55.150
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

201
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>A cod,</v>

202
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>and you'll certainly recognize the name of this one because it was Waco on</v>

203
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>February the 28th,</v>

204
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:01.981
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

205
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>93 ATF agents raided the branch Davidians,</v>

206
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>religious compound outside of Waco,</v>

207
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:10.090
<v Speaker 1>after David Koresh was accused of violating firearms regulations.</v>

208
00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And if you do want to learn more about David Koresh,</v>

209
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>do check out our video about him.</v>

210
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to link to it in the description below.</v>

211
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Now that rate,</v>

212
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a massacre that killed four atf agents and six Davidians.</v>

213
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>The massacre then turned into a standoff before transforming into a siege.</v>

214
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>When the FBI got involved for the next 51 days,</v>

215
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>the world watched his waco became a succuss.</v>

216
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>The firearms angle drew and protestors from across the country,</v>

217
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.910
<v Speaker 1>and among them was Timothy Mcveigh,</v>

218
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>but they joined the crowd of journalists.</v>

219
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Protest isn't rubberneck,</v>

220
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.130
<v Speaker 1>is on a hill three miles from the compounds watching as all the action unfolded.</v>

221
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.171
<v Speaker 1>He hawks nt,</v>

222
00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 1>government bumper stickers,</v>

223
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>and like many others predicted another Ruby Ridge.</v>

224
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

225
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't be there to see quite how right he was.</v>

226
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.200
<v Speaker 1>On April the 19th,</v>

227
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the FBI tried to storm the compound instead to the world watched in horror as it</v>

228
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>went up in flames.</v>

229
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Billowing black smoke filled the sky hanging in a poisonous cloud above Texas.</v>

230
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.511
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

231
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>the is still debate over who started the fire,</v>

232
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's no debate over the outcome.</v>

233
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>The charred corpses of 75 Davidians were eventually pulled from the rubble among</v>

234
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:14.034
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

235
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five children.</v>

236
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:15.751
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

237
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:20.751
<v Speaker 1>they watched the Davidians burn live on tv from Nicole says couch on his farm in</v>

238
00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>

239
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what he felt.</v>

240
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Seeing his darkest fears realized is of course unknown,</v>

241
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that in the aftermath,</v>

242
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>mcgann Nichols began experimenting with building pipe bombs.</v>

243
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.130
<v Speaker 1>They're angry at the government had reached a boiling point,</v>

244
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>and the two men began the slow slide toward extremism,</v>

245
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and of course committing horrifying vengeance.</v>

246
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.330
<v Speaker 1>In September of 1994,</v>

247
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:53.780
<v Speaker 1>President Bill Clinton signed into law the assault weapons ban,</v>

248
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:58.070
<v Speaker 1>briefly outlawing certain types of firearms coming in the wake of Ruby Ridge and</v>

249
00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Waco.</v>

250
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>The band was like tossing gasoline onto the fire of anti government propaganda.</v>

251
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Mcgarvey would lay to claim that this was the last straw.</v>

252
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Initially the young extremist.</v>

253
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>He hoped to assassinate prominent figures in the federal government among his</v>

254
00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:11.780
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

255
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>What Attorney General Janet Reno Lawn Hurry,</v>

256
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:15.111
<v Speaker 1>Archie,</v>

257
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.410
<v Speaker 1>the FBI sniper who'd killed Vicky Weaver at Ruby Ridge,</v>

258
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.950
<v Speaker 1>but this planet soon fizzles getting past and bodyguards was too tricky and</v>

259
00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>there was no guarantee mcvay would be able to assassinate even a single figure</v>

260
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:26.960
<v Speaker 1>before being caught.</v>

261
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

262
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 1>he turns to an unlikely source of inspiration,</v>

263
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalism.</v>

264
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.561
<v Speaker 1>The year before,</v>

265
00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:35.200
<v Speaker 1>just three days before the waco siege,</v>

266
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.610
<v Speaker 1>just small Islamist cell had exploded,</v>

267
00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:39.650
<v Speaker 1>a truck bomb beneath the world trade center up.</v>

268
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.560
<v Speaker 1>The boss had been intended to collapse the north tower,</v>

269
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 1>killing hundreds of people in the end,</v>

270
00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>though it failed to damage the foundations and killed only six people from like</v>

271
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>the 1993,</v>

272
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>WTC bombing was a source of both inspiration and contempts.</v>

273
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>While he was impressed that such a small salad manage to attack such a high</v>

274
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>profile landmark,</v>

275
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you considered their attack a failure in later years.</v>

276
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 1>He admitted to studying for bombing obsessively and he vowed that he could do</v>

277
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

278
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 1>His first step was to get Terry Nichols involved richer than mcvay and with more</v>

279
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>practical knowledge and explosives,</v>

280
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Nichols was necessary for the success of any attack.</v>

281
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So in late September,</v>

282
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 1>mcvay took him to one side and explained his plan together.</v>

283
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 1>The two of them were going to blow up the federal building,</v>

284
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>just like in the town of diaries,</v>

285
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and a happier world would have responded by saying,</v>

286
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

287
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>a short end and then immediately alerting the FBI.</v>

288
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:35.080
<v Speaker 1>But this isn't a happier weld.</v>

289
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>The feds,</v>

290
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>they were the enemy and Nichols was just as angry and just as ready to lash out</v>

291
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.110
<v Speaker 1>at the government as mcvay was.</v>

292
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>So when mcvay said,</v>

293
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>let's build a bum nichols.</v>

294
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.663
<v Speaker 1>He simply said,</v>

295
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

296
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.493
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

297
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:48.563
<v Speaker 1>Throughout September,</v>

298
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>the slowly began amassing bags of fertilizer.</v>

299
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 1>When they weren't buying,</v>

300
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>they were hanging out with our old buddy Michael 40 errands,</v>

301
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 1>setting off pipe bombs in secluded canyons,</v>

302
00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 1>biography about mcvay.</v>

303
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>They had made a connection who promised to sell them nitromethane a highly</v>

304
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 1>potent racing fuel.</v>

305
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>On October the 20th of the Padre have to Dallas,</v>

306
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Texas to pick up a batch on the way they stopped in Oklahoma City.</v>

307
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

308
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 1>a controversy remains over the points at which mcvay decided to bomb the Alfred</v>

309
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>p Murrah Federal Building,</v>

310
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>some belief the decision was taken in September.</v>

311
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Others believe that wasn't until the morning of the bombing when the original</v>

312
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 1>target have to be scrapped at the last minutes,</v>

313
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>whatever the truth,</v>

314
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the FBI's official chronology of Mcveigh's movements in the fall of 1994 states</v>

315
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 1>that he had nichols pulled over outside the Murrah building on their way to</v>

316
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Dallas long after he was arrested,</v>

317
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.320
<v Speaker 1>like they would say,</v>

318
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.090
<v Speaker 1>had originally chosen another federal building in the city,</v>

319
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>but had a change of heart when he noticed it.</v>

320
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.840
<v Speaker 1>How is the flower store?</v>

321
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.501
<v Speaker 1>Evidently,</v>

322
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:48.340
<v Speaker 1>he felt no such reluctance when he saw the Mara Buildings Daycare Center.</v>

323
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It was during the Dallas trip that mcvay got some unfortunate news.</v>

324
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 1>His grandfather had passed away following a long illness.</v>

325
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.730
<v Speaker 1>The man who'd once been young timothy,</v>

326
00:13:56.731 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 1>his only friend was now gone,</v>

327
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.093
<v Speaker 1>and with that,</v>

328
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's lost connection to the world was severed.</v>

329
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.290
<v Speaker 1>The next few months unfolded in a haze of petty crimes of fertilizers,</v>

330
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 1>stockpiling and mind numbing normalcy.</v>

331
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I think they visited gun shows,</v>

332
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:13.630
<v Speaker 1>try to hook up with women and even took a vacation.</v>

333
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.611
<v Speaker 1>This building,</v>

334
00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>this average bustle of life,</v>

335
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>something much darker was beginning to take shape.</v>

336
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Nichols by now we're stealing guns to generate funding and the two were slowly</v>

337
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:28.290
<v Speaker 1>filling countless drums with fertilizer and with fuel as a 1994,</v>

338
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>six over into 1995.</v>

339
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Mcvay was making more and more trips to Oklahoma City at least once with 40 year</v>

340
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>in tow away from his future target,</v>

341
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>though he was starting to dabble and crystal meth and acid as the winter slipped</v>

342
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>away into spring mcveigh,</v>

343
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.140
<v Speaker 1>he caught himself off from everyone,</v>

344
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 1>even nichols by April.</v>

345
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>He was spending long nights sleeping in his car and lying low in motels at some</v>

346
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:50.900
<v Speaker 1>point 40 years.</v>

347
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Wife made him a fake id to use for renting vehicles.</v>

348
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>The glaze last week as a free man is still shrouded in mystery.</v>

349
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>He rented a hotel room in junction city,</v>

350
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Kansas and may have been spotted conversing with still unidentified men at some</v>

351
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:04.840
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

352
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>a man known as John Doe to allegedly rented the rider truck used in the blast</v>

353
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>eye witness accounts of due to fuel conspiracy theories about the bombing to</v>

354
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:15.320
<v Speaker 1>this very day as Easter Sunday.</v>

355
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 95 arrived.</v>

356
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Nichols finally traveled down to Kansas on April the 18th in mcvay,</v>

357
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 1>drove out to Gary Lake with our fertilizer and fuel.</v>

358
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>As the sun came up over the water,</v>

359
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.410
<v Speaker 1>they mixed their ingredients together,</v>

360
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:29.650
<v Speaker 1>creating a highly unstable bomb.</v>

361
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 1>By noon,</v>

362
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.453
<v Speaker 1>they were done.</v>

363
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Mcveigh's said goodbye.</v>

364
00:15:32.611 --> 00:15:36.350
<v Speaker 1>He goes back and the Ryder truck and drove off into the bright spring afternoon.</v>

365
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>The next time Nicholas,</v>

366
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.190
<v Speaker 1>how it is old friends name it would be in for this.</v>

367
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.490
<v Speaker 1>On April the 19th,</v>

368
00:15:47.491 --> 00:15:51.600
<v Speaker 1>1995 state Trooper Charlie Hangar was out patrolling the empty highways north of</v>

369
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma City when he spotted a car driving without place.</v>

370
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 1>It had been a heavy morning hanging out,</v>

371
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Speaker 1>just heard on the radio that some kind of explosion had happened in Oklahoma</v>

372
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.450
<v Speaker 1>City and all the cops in the area were converging on the disaster,</v>

373
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.150
<v Speaker 1>but hangar was nothing if not by the book.</v>

374
00:16:06.151 --> 00:16:10.110
<v Speaker 1>So rather than turn his car around and scream towards the smoke-filled skyline,</v>

375
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.710
<v Speaker 1>he flicked on his lights and pulled over the battered old.</v>

376
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.640
<v Speaker 1>This mercury or gone to young man was sat in the driver's seat.</v>

377
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.180
<v Speaker 1>A common expression on his face as hanging around to see his license.</v>

378
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:25.410
<v Speaker 1>He noticed a bulge under the young man's jacket he was carrying and illegal</v>

379
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.310
<v Speaker 1>concealed weapon.</v>

380
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Young then followed hang as iron line and gave a tight grin.</v>

381
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.140
<v Speaker 1>My gun is loaded.</v>

382
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Officer,</v>

383
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.723
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

384
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.593
<v Speaker 1>so is mine.</v>

385
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Revlite hanger,</v>

386
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Yanking his pistol out and pointing it to the young man's head as hang a</v>

387
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.640
<v Speaker 1>drover's prisoner back towards Perry and the local county courthouse.</v>

388
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.730
<v Speaker 1>He was passed by more vehicles speeding towards Oklahoma city.</v>

389
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.760
<v Speaker 1>It never even occurred to him that he might have the bommer.</v>

390
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Saturn is backseat.</v>

391
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.020
<v Speaker 1>The Oklahoma City bomb had exploded at nine.</v>

392
00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:52.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

393
00:16:52.171 --> 00:16:54.150
<v Speaker 1>2:00 AM in front of the Murrah building.</v>

394
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>The blasted,</v>

395
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.870
<v Speaker 1>removed the north wing and collapsed all nine floors.</v>

396
00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Windows 25 miles away had shaken from the shockwave in the aftermath.</v>

397
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Ordinary Oklahomans that watched in horror as the bloodied corpses of children</v>

398
00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:08.940
<v Speaker 1>were pulled from the huddle,</v>

399
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:14.150
<v Speaker 1>all told a 168 lives had been snuffed out as news spreads suited.</v>

400
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.830
<v Speaker 1>The suspicion that a foreign power was involved,</v>

401
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.690
<v Speaker 1>the bomb was simply too powerful.</v>

402
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.280
<v Speaker 1>The media broadcast stories about Arab terrorists attacking the heartland grave,</v>

403
00:17:23.281 --> 00:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>looking spokespeople.</v>

404
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It came on TV and said that was a possibility.</v>

405
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.481
<v Speaker 1>Saddam Hussein,</v>

406
00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:30.660
<v Speaker 1>it actually orchestrated the attack and very courthouse.</v>

407
00:17:30.661 --> 00:17:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Timothy Mcveigh commonly watched these reports unfold.</v>

408
00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:34.523
<v Speaker 1>At that moment.</v>

409
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.340
<v Speaker 1>He was the most wanted man on the planet.</v>

410
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.950
<v Speaker 1>No one had the faintest inkling that he was already in jail on Friday morning,</v>

411
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:42.090
<v Speaker 1>two days after the bombing,</v>

412
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.640
<v Speaker 1>mcveigh was about to go and see the judge and post bail.</v>

413
00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 1>When a forensic FBI operates,</v>

414
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:46.831
<v Speaker 1>called Charlie,</v>

415
00:17:46.831 --> 00:17:50.360
<v Speaker 1>hanging out to ask if it's traffic violation was still sitting in the cells.</v>

416
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Hang.</v>

417
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

418
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

419
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

420
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Keeping there the operator box.</v>

421
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you do,</v>

422
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 1>do not let him go.</v>

423
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.931
<v Speaker 1>By fluke,</v>

424
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the Ryder trucks axel had been destroyed in the blast,</v>

425
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 1>held two blocks through the air.</v>

426
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It had been recovered with its serial number still intact.</v>

427
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>The FBI managed to trace it back to a motel where mcvay had stayed using his</v>

428
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:13.010
<v Speaker 1>real name and with that the game was up in Perry,</v>

429
00:18:13.011 --> 00:18:15.520
<v Speaker 1>a mob of angry Oklahomans surrounded the courthouse.</v>

430
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Has Federal agents arrested mcvay Sean solve baby killer,</v>

431
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 1>filled the APP as he was dragged out into the media spotlight,</v>

432
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 1>mcvay seemed totally unfazed by the attention.</v>

433
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 1>He simply scans the nearby rooftops,</v>

434
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 1>his eyes flitting from one to the other with an eerie calm.</v>

435
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Mcvay would later say that he was sure and FBI sniper was amounts taken out as</v>

436
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>they had with Vicky weaver three years earlier.</v>

437
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That would be bad because he didn't want to die until he told his story until it</v>

438
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 1>explained why he had done it.</v>

439
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>It was sure that when the American people heard his reasoning,</v>

440
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 1>they would rise up against the government's.</v>

441
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Just like in the Turner Diaries,</v>

442
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Timothy Mcveigh was indicted on August the 10th,</v>

443
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.820
<v Speaker 1>1995.</v>

444
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.833
<v Speaker 1>Terry Nichols said,</v>

445
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>surrender to authorities.</v>

446
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:59.800
<v Speaker 1>The day that mcvay was identified and was charged as a coconspirator.</v>

447
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Michael Fortier was also arrested and tenant star witness in return for a</v>

448
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>lenient sentence of the three men.</v>

449
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Only 40 year would ever tasted freedom again.</v>

450
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.170
<v Speaker 1>In the end of the trial of Timothy Mcveigh took one month,</v>

451
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.400
<v Speaker 1>mcvay instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense arguing that he was in</v>

452
00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:26.510
<v Speaker 1>immediate danger from the government and the bombing was an act of self defense,</v>

453
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but there's as they refused.</v>

454
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the trial,</v>

455
00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:32.780
<v Speaker 1>the jury unanimously recommended death by Nathan injection.</v>

456
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Terry Nichols was sentenced to a hundred and 61 consecutive life sentences with</v>

457
00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.260
<v Speaker 1>no possibility of parole.</v>

458
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Following Mcveigh's conviction,</v>

459
00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 1>do you balance Oklahomans paid to fly the jury out to Oklahoma City and gave</v>

460
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.690
<v Speaker 1>them a vip tour for a brief period after his trial.</v>

461
00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Mcvay was incarcerated in Adx,</v>

462
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:50.001
<v Speaker 1>Florence,</v>

463
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Colorado in a wing known as bombers,</v>

464
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.580
<v Speaker 1>rope a real life Arkham asylum bombers.</v>

465
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Row was already homes the unibomber Ted Kaczynski,</v>

466
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>NWTC,</v>

467
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.641
<v Speaker 1>Bama,</v>

468
00:19:58.641 --> 00:19:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Ramsey,</v>

469
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.063
<v Speaker 1>Yousef.</v>

470
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.060
<v Speaker 1>According to one of Mcveigh's biographers,</v>

471
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.420
<v Speaker 1>he and Kaczynski became firm friends bonding over a love of nature.</v>

472
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Yusef meanwhile tried to convert to Islam,</v>

473
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but mcvay politely declined.</v>

474
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Mcveigh's never expressed any remorse for his actions.</v>

475
00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And in his biography,</v>

476
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>he called the 19 dead children collateral damage.</v>

477
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.770
<v Speaker 1>He maintains that the bombing was a justified response to waco and he wasn't</v>

478
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:22.400
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

479
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>The great writer golf,</v>

480
00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.840
<v Speaker 1>it all became a pen pal of Mcveigh's and spend the last years of his life</v>

481
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.820
<v Speaker 1>ultimately defending mcveigh's actions.</v>

482
00:20:28.821 --> 00:20:29.271
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>

483
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:30.920
<v Speaker 1>comparing him to an American hero,</v>

484
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:31.754
<v Speaker 1>Paul Revere,</v>

485
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.900
<v Speaker 1>and suggesting that he was really innocent while mcvay respected at all.</v>

486
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:39.080
<v Speaker 1>He had no truck with theories that had been framed.</v>

487
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.990
<v Speaker 1>He had carried out in the morning and he wanted everyone to know it.</v>

488
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Look was finally executed on July the 11th,</v>

489
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.030
<v Speaker 1>2001 the day he was put to death.</v>

490
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>So many natives of Oklahoma City.</v>

491
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to watch the monster die,</v>

492
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.810
<v Speaker 1>that a lottery system had to be set up to ration places in the chain.</v>

493
00:20:53.811 --> 00:20:57.990
<v Speaker 1>The the rest wants to fire a satellite link from the very city mcvay had</v>

494
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 1>callously torn the heart out of any six years before at 7:15 AM,</v>

495
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:07.501
<v Speaker 1>Timothy Mcveigh became the first federal prisoner to be executed since 1963 as a</v>

496
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 1>cocktail of lethal drugs with slowly pumped into a system.</v>

497
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.770
<v Speaker 1>He refused to say a word.</v>

498
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 1>We're very calm.</v>

499
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.690
<v Speaker 1>He simply looked into the camera broadcasting is death to Oklahoma City,</v>

500
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 1>forcing his eyes to stay open even as his heart slowed to a stop.</v>

501
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.060
<v Speaker 1>When he finally died,</v>

502
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 1>his eyes remained fixed on the camera,</v>

503
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 1>as if mocking those that had hurt so much,</v>

504
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but the moment when he died,</v>

505
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.671
<v Speaker 1>it was lost.</v>

506
00:21:29.671 --> 00:21:31.990
<v Speaker 1>A mind of the deadliest attack in US history.</v>

507
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.160
<v Speaker 1>It was the boy next door who read a book and they're determined its plot into a</v>

508
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 1>horrifying reality.</v>

509
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 1>As his heart stopped,</v>

510
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it was on a world in which Americans still feared the government and right wing</v>

511
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:45.040
<v Speaker 1>terra was the biggest concern of law enforcement.</v>

512
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.400
<v Speaker 1>It was a world that mcvay had helped to create,</v>

513
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't one that would last exactly three months after mcvay breathed his</v>

514
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 1>last Islamic fundamentalists smashed planes into the twin towers and the</v>

515
00:21:56.321 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon killing 17 times as many as mcvay had in the aftermath of nine slash</v>

516
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 1>seven support for the government surge to its highest level in decades.</v>

517
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Rightwing terror vanished from the headlines,</v>

518
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:11.791
<v Speaker 1>replaced by the specter of Islamic extremism in the wake of nearly 3000 dead in</v>

519
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:12.820
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>

520
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 1>The bombing of the Murrah building was almost forgotten,</v>

521
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 1>yet mcveigh's still holds a special place in American history.</v>

522
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>No domestic terrorist has ever equals of the horrific acts that he carries out</v>

523
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 1>that day and act,</v>

524
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:28.720
<v Speaker 1>which inspired everyone from the columbine killers to Anders Breivik.</v>

525
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.643
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>

526
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 1>he costs along poisonous shadow once again.</v>

527
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Anti government further is on the rise far right.</v>

528
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Extremists like dylan roof and Pittsburgh shooter,</v>

529
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Robert bowers are sewing terror in American communities as the world lurches</v>

530
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 1>back towards a darker place.</v>

531
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 1>It's worth remembering the life of Timothy Mcveigh and the lessons that is awful</v>

532
00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 1>crime taught us all.</v>
