<v Speaker 1>Leading Bolsheviks were arrested but not Stalin who was considered of listened</v>

142
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.810
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>

143
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Stalin hid Lennon and helped him disappear into Finland in late October.</v>

144
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Then resends Patrick grads and,</v>

145
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>just an immediate seizure of power.</v>

147
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.441
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

148
00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>it moderates within the party advised restraint,</v>

149
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.191
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

150
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly sided with them.</v>

151
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Then it however pressed on,</v>

152
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>on October the 23rd amazing was health in which it was voted to undertake an</v>

153
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 1>armed uprising.</v>

154
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.611
<v Speaker 1>Two days later,</v>

155
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks armed wing led by Leon Trotsky took control of Petra grasp.</v>

156
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>The provisional government was overthrown.</v>

157
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>The Soviets had seized power lending,</v>

158
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>instituted the new government,</v>

159
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>the council of People's Commerce Arts Starlin was appointed the people's</v>

160
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>commissar of nationalities across Russia.</v>

161
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Group's supposed to,</v>

162
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Lennon's new autocracy joined forces to remove the Bolshevik governments as the</v>

163
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Russians have war broke out.</v>

164
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was appointed a political commissar and it's put in charge of the defense</v>

165
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>of the city of Sanford sin.</v>

166
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>This is the city that would ultimately become Stalingrad.</v>

167
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>He frequently clashed with Trotsky who had been appointed his military superior.</v>

168
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>He wants him prison's a group of Trotsky supporters on a leaky bodge ans left</v>

169
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>them to drown.</v>

170
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.400
<v Speaker 1>The Bolsheviks at this point changed their name to the Russian Communist Party.</v>

171
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's rise through this group's ranks was impressive and he owed it all to</v>

172
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the support of Lennon.</v>

173
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>In 1922 Lennon made him general secretary of the Communist Party's central</v>

174
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 1>committee,</v>

175
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.883
<v Speaker 1>a posty health.</v>

176
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>For the rest of his life,</v>

177
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but within a year,</v>

178
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 1>stolen had fallen out with Lennon,</v>

179
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.271
<v Speaker 1>Georgia.</v>

180
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>It's Darlene's.</v>

181
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Home State had been promised autonomy at the time of the revolution,</v>

182
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but that promise had been reneges on between 1918 and 1921 it's an enjoyed a</v>

183
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>period of self rule was in 1922 Lennon decided to bring us back into the fault.</v>

184
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>He wants it the reunion to be a peaceful one,</v>

185
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 1>but stolen.</v>

186
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>He had other ideas.</v>

187
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 1>He cracked down hot,</v>

188
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 1>having the leaders of the George and rebellion execute it and then at this point</v>

189
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>he was absolutely furious.</v>

190
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 1>But in late 1922 he suffered the first of a series of strokes which severely</v>

191
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 1>impacted his ability to command in its estimates,</v>

192
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 1>which was published in November.</v>

193
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>He castigated Stalin.</v>

194
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Stalin is too rude.</v>

195
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>This defects becomes intolerable in a secretary general.</v>

196
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>That is why I suggest the comrades.</v>

197
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Think of a way of removing stolen from that post and appointing another man in</v>

198
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:14.654
<v Speaker 1>his stat.</v>

199
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Months later,</v>

200
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>while Lennon was still hospitalized style in that phone then and his wife,</v>

201
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>who he suspected of feeding her husband's dislike event and subjected her to an</v>

202
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>avalanche of abuse referring to her in the conversation as a syphilitic whore.</v>

203
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 1>When Lennon found out about this,</v>

204
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>he was unsurprisingly outraged.</v>

205
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Many people actually believe the stress of the situation precipitated Lennon's</v>

206
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

207
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>About 10 months later after Lennon's death,</v>

208
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Stalin took the lead in organizing the funeral,</v>

209
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>the pairing as the chief pallbearer.</v>

210
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that he initiated the deification of Lenin,</v>

211
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>even renaming Petrograd as Lennon Grasp Stalin.</v>

212
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>He used this opportunity to reinvent himself as the bearer of Lennon's legacy.</v>

213
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>From now on to now,</v>

214
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was to doubt Lennon</v>

215
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 1>stolons main rival was now Leon Trotsky and his followers.</v>

216
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.610
<v Speaker 1>The leftist Trotskyites in 1925 style enforced Trotsky to resign as people's</v>

217
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>comments off a wall from now on,</v>

218
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 1>anyone who spoke out against the secretary general worth risking their very</v>

219
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>lives when open opposition broke out in late 1927 it's tremendous,</v>

220
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>including Trotsky was expelled from the party.</v>

221
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky was exiled to Kazakhstan men.</v>

222
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>1919 stolen,</v>

223
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>married his second wife.</v>

224
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Now up,</v>

225
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>they had two children,</v>

226
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Vaseline born in 1921 and fed liner,</v>

227
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.710
<v Speaker 1>born in 1926 on the evening of November the eighth 1932 the couple what?</v>

228
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Hosting a party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution.</v>

229
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>They often argued,</v>

230
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>and this occasion it was no difference and that edge,</v>

231
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>the accused or husbands of being inconsiderate towards that,</v>

232
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>he responded by humiliating her in front of their guests.</v>

233
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 1>He flicked cigarettes a ta and to address her is,</v>

234
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 1>hey you,</v>

235
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the following morning sevens found the Danish to dads have a gunshot wound to</v>

236
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the head during the rough and civil war,</v>

237
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Lenina daughter,</v>

238
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>the acquisition of the peasants,</v>

239
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>grain and livestock,</v>

240
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>85% of the Soviet population,</v>

241
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 1>they lived off the land.</v>

242
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>He had also ordered the collectivization of farms.</v>

243
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Peasants perceived as better off the Kulaks were to be destroyed,</v>

244
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

245
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.973
<v Speaker 1>or to port it.</v>

246
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.820
<v Speaker 1>These measures caused widespread devastation and eventually famine</v>

247
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.380
<v Speaker 1>lines in his mistake.</v>

248
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Man In in 1921 introduced the new economic policy to try to improve the</v>

249
00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:25.654
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

250
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.260
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

251
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.190
<v Speaker 1>in 1928 style and decided to reintroduce collectivization,</v>

252
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.720
<v Speaker 1>he aims to achieve this.</v>

253
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Within five years,</v>

254
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.460
<v Speaker 1>anyone who was resisted was simply put to death.</v>

255
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>In December of 1929 stolen announced the liquidation of the Kulaks as a class or</v>

256
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:46.210
<v Speaker 1>a peasants were encouraged to denounce the Kulaks who were to be shot on sight</v>

257
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.530
<v Speaker 1>or if they were lucky,</v>

258
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.450
<v Speaker 1>deported to gulags in Siberia.</v>

259
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Stalin sent out armed forces into the countryside to force villagers into</v>

260
00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:54.220
<v Speaker 1>collectives.</v>

261
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Many of the people had no knowledge of agriculture.</v>

262
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.460
<v Speaker 1>The Q legs resulted to slaughtering their own cattle and destroying their own</v>

263
00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:03.940
<v Speaker 1>equipment rather than see it disappear into the hands of the state.</v>

264
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Terrible famine.</v>

265
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Then in Syria and Ukraine,</v>

266
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.020
<v Speaker 1>it was the worst with up to 10 million people dying this time was to be</v>

267
00:11:11.021 --> 00:11:12.460
<v Speaker 1>remembered as the killing of hunger.</v>

268
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.230
<v Speaker 1>At the state offered no help.</v>

270
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.830
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

271
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.000
<v Speaker 1>anyone caught with so much as a handful of grain was liable to punishment by</v>

272
00:11:19.001 --> 00:11:19.720
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

273
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.481
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

274
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:20.771
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

275
00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:22.180
<v Speaker 1>people were starving to death,</v>

276
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:22.630
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

277
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.630
<v Speaker 1>exported millions of tons of vitally needed grain in 1931 stolen stated that the</v>

278
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union was a hundred years behind other countries.</v>

279
00:11:30.551 --> 00:11:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Technologically,</v>

280
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.680
<v Speaker 1>they had 10 years to catch up or they would be crushed by the rest of the world.</v>

281
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.890
<v Speaker 1>His five year plan saw the birth of new industrial cities.</v>

282
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Within a decade.</v>

283
00:11:39.851 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet Union had indeed some hostile nations in terms of industrial</v>

284
00:11:43.451 --> 00:11:46.510
<v Speaker 1>developments with the exception of the United States,</v>

285
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.160
<v Speaker 1>but ordinary Russians.</v>

286
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 1>They fell a new benefit from stolen successes.</v>

287
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Factory workers became fixated on meeting unrealistic targets if they failed.</v>

288
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>They risked the harshest of punishments.</v>

289
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>By 1935 uh,</v>

290
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>million citizens were residing in Stalin's forced labor camps.</v>

291
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>The gulags at the 1934 political congress,</v>

292
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>a threat to Stalin's absolute power in merged in the form of Leningrad Party</v>

293
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:12.280
<v Speaker 1>boss Sergei Kirov stolen,</v>

294
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 1>reacted with a fierce purge of the party.</v>

295
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.470
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of 1,108 that's 56% of the congress delegates arrested and one third</v>

296
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>of them execute it.</v>

297
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.100
<v Speaker 1>On September the first 1934 Sergei Kirov was assassinated outside the party</v>

298
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>officer's in Leningrad,</v>

299
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>the alleged assassin,</v>

300
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 1>his wife and his 85 year old's mother will quickly put to death.</v>

301
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Though many people believe that Stalin himself was behind this assassination,</v>

302
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.391
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

303
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>seized upon this assassination as the catalyst for the great terror.</v>

304
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.220
<v Speaker 1>He brought in a new law which deprived of defendants have any defense.</v>

305
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>A number of Moscow show trials were held nearly all of them resulting in the</v>

306
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.920
<v Speaker 1>death penalty over the next three years,</v>

307
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>up to 1939 Stalin's purges became increasingly severe.</v>

308
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 1>He did this for any methodically drawing up arrest quotas along with numbers to</v>

309
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>be shot in each district still over fulfillments.</v>

310
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 1>If this was encouraged,</v>

311
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>people terrified of being denounced got in with their denunciations first before</v>

312
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 1>the two words announced.</v>

313
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.230
<v Speaker 1>This led to the gulags soon being overcrowded and new complexes had to be built</v>

314
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>by slave labor.</v>

315
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>No one except for Stalin himself could Trudy and piece.</v>

316
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Many of those in positions of power became terrified that they too would be next</v>

317
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:26.380
<v Speaker 1>with some of them are committing suicide in order to do escape their fate.</v>

318
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>The military,</v>

319
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.870
<v Speaker 1>we're not immune to the purchase either.</v>

320
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.900
<v Speaker 1>At the same time that Hitler was taking me over,</v>

321
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Austria stolen was ordering the execution of his most able military leaders,</v>

322
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>those who survived and became paranoid of one another during 1939 is Hitler's</v>

323
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:45.211
<v Speaker 1>military muscle flexing pushed Europe towards war in feared for the safety of</v>

324
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 1>his country.</v>

325
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>He looks to Great Britain as a potential ally,</v>

326
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>but prison didn't appear to be doing much of anything at all.</v>

327
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 1>So when approached by Germany,</v>

328
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 1>it stolen,</v>

329
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>didn't hesitate.</v>

330
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 1>He signs a nonaggression pact with Hitler.</v>

331
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It declared simply that the Russian and German people would not take up arms</v>

332
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:01.384
<v Speaker 1>against each other.</v>

333
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.280
<v Speaker 1>This took a great deal of pressure off stolen</v>

334
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.380
<v Speaker 1>and the summer of 1940 headless subjugation of Europe seemed unstoppable and</v>

335
00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:16.370
<v Speaker 1>less than two weeks is blitzkrieg pans or armies had rolled through Belgium,</v>

336
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Holland,</v>

337
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>and France.</v>

338
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.720
<v Speaker 1>And at this point he began looking to the east stolen.</v>

339
00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:21.170
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

340
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.080
<v Speaker 1>couldn't believe that the fewer up would go back on his word,</v>

341
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.070
<v Speaker 1>but on June the 22nd 1941 this is exactly what happens.</v>

342
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Nazi troops crossed the Polish border and invaded the Soviet Union.</v>

343
00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.460
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet leader was caught totally off guard.</v>

344
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.443
<v Speaker 1>Within a month,</v>

345
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.330
<v Speaker 1>German troops were a hundred miles from Leningrad.</v>

346
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Smolensk fell on July the 16th ends.</v>

347
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.240
<v Speaker 1>By June the 26 just four days after the attack had begun,</v>

348
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 1>400,000 Soviet soldiers were trapped as the German tenses and closed around</v>

349
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Minsk,</v>

350
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>a key stronghold on route to Moscow.</v>

351
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>On June the 29th reports reached Moscow that the city of mince could fallen.</v>

352
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 1>It was only a week since the German invasion had begun.</v>

353
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 1>At this rate,</v>

354
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 1>the Germans expected to be in Moscow within a month.</v>

355
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.760
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that stolen.</v>

356
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to finally grasp the enormity of the disaster.</v>

357
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 1>He raged at his generals,</v>

358
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:11.900
<v Speaker 1>even reducing the stolid head of the army's Yaakov to tears,</v>

359
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>but then stolen crumbles.</v>

360
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.043
<v Speaker 1>He grinds,</v>

361
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>everything's lost.</v>

362
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I give up then and found it all Allstate and we've screwed it off.</v>

363
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Stolen was driven to his dodger on the outskirts of Moscow.</v>

364
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 1>He slumped in shock in his arm chat the next day.</v>

365
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:28.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't come into the Kremlin or responding to phone calls and as absence.</v>

366
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 1>No one dared to make any decisions or sign any documents.</v>

367
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there was a chilling vacuum at the heart of power.</v>

368
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Historians are divided on Stalin's mindset during this time.</v>

369
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Some believe that he was playing a dangerous game with is in a circle watching</v>

370
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>and waiting to see who would try to seize the reins during this time of crisis.</v>

371
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Others are of the opinion that he gained close to a nervous breakdown.</v>

372
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.040
<v Speaker 1>What style in faced was not just military to feet,</v>

373
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.640
<v Speaker 1>but the collapse of everything that he had worked for within Russia.</v>

374
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.361
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

375
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:59.430
<v Speaker 1>on June the 30th the politburo drove ounce to Stalin's dot.</v>

376
00:15:59.431 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Shah.</v>

377
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>They found him still sitting in his arm.</v>

378
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

379
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.560
<v Speaker 1>he looks up at them,</v>

380
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:02.681
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

381
00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>good and novice,</v>

382
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.520
<v Speaker 1>and he asked,</v>

383
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>why have you come?</v>

384
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.130
<v Speaker 1>He suspected a COO,</v>

385
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 1>but the politburo did not want to overthrow Stalin.</v>

386
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.010
<v Speaker 1>They wanted him to return to the Kremlin and take charge of the state.</v>

387
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:13.821
<v Speaker 1>Defense Committee.</v>

388
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:15.950
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet wall cabinets are relieved,</v>

389
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:16.550
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

390
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that is most vulnerable ever asked,</v>

391
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 1>can I leave the country to victory?</v>

392
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 1>That may be more deserving candidates.</v>

393
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>The reply though,</v>

394
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it came quickly.</v>

395
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.720
<v Speaker 1>There is none more worthy.</v>

396
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.411
<v Speaker 1>Nodding,</v>

397
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

398
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.401
<v Speaker 1>accepted.</v>

399
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:30.830
<v Speaker 1>His new role as he began to regain has enough.</v>

400
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Kiev was overrun by September.</v>

401
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's advises had begged him to evacuate the deemed city.</v>

402
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 1>However he refused and more than half a million people were either killed or</v>

403
00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 1>taken prisoner centrally for a scapegoat.</v>

404
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Stolen blames the prisoners themselves.</v>

405
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>All prisoners of war he declared were traitors.</v>

406
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Those who resounds after the war were sent directly to labor camps when his son,</v>

407
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:56.120
<v Speaker 1>by his first marriage Yaakov was taken prisoner of the Nazis approached style</v>

408
00:16:56.121 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>and about trading him for some of their own and Cynthia replied,</v>

409
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but he had no son by that name.</v>

410
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Yaakov was shot and killed by outside of the gym and sweat perilously close to</v>

411
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Moscow.</v>

412
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 1>The government's moved 500 miles away,</v>

413
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but Stalin,</v>

414
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 1>he decided to stay attending a parade on Red Square.</v>

415
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>On November the seventh the tank strove Posten and onto the front lines just 25</v>

416
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:19.340
<v Speaker 1>miles outside of the city.</v>

417
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet troops fought valiantly and the Russian Windsor began to cripple the</v>

418
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>German forces in the ends.</v>

419
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis were unable to solidify their gains and as they were steadily beaten</v>

420
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:29.330
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

421
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 1>stolen.</v>

422
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Also wisely teamed up with the allies will install in Churchill and Roosevelt.</v>

423
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Matt at the Toronto Conference in 1943 Joseph Stalin was reintroduced to the</v>

424
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 1>west as kindly uncle Joe.</v>

425
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>By 1945 the Soviets had won the war,</v>

426
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but the cost,</v>

427
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 1>it was enormous.</v>

428
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.820
<v Speaker 1>More than 25 million Soviets had died six times as many as in Germany.</v>

429
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Stalin vowed that he would never let Russia be this vulnerable again of the</v>

430
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.631
<v Speaker 1>Yalta Conference.</v>

431
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 1>In 1945 the allies match to discuss the postwar world.</v>

432
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Stalin made it clear that eastern Europe was to remain under his control,</v>

433
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Britain and the USA.</v>

434
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

435
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>we're not happy with Stalin's actions in eastern Europe.</v>

436
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill famously declared that an iron curtain had descended across</v>

437
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 1>the continent and with that,</v>

438
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War began</v>

439
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.780
<v Speaker 1>back home.</v>

440
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was even more popular than before.</v>

441
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Grateful Russians hopes that the great victory overhead low would sweep clean</v>

442
00:18:27.621 --> 00:18:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the misery of the past.</v>

443
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

444
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.230
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

445
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the war had Millie distracted not to changed.</v>

446
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Stalin,</v>

447
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.660
<v Speaker 1>even though the crowds adored him,</v>

448
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.970
<v Speaker 1>he was convinced that everyone was out to get him.</v>

449
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of returning soldiers were sent to labor camps.</v>

450
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Many Jewish intellectuals and doctors were tried and killed on style.</v>

451
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.370
<v Speaker 1>The 70th birthday in 1949 images of the grades leader we're projected into the</v>

452
00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:53.090
<v Speaker 1>skies over Moscow is all seeing eye was omnipresence,</v>

453
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but the ravages of old age.</v>

454
00:18:54.411 --> 00:18:56.870
<v Speaker 1>We're beginning to catch up with him after a great feast.</v>

455
00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:01.871
<v Speaker 1>On February the 28th of 1953 Joseph Stalin had a paralyzing stroke over the next</v>

456
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:02.750
<v Speaker 1>few days.</v>

457
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.340
<v Speaker 1>He slowly suffocated to death.</v>

458
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Stalin died on the morning of March the fifth 1953 his funeral was an</v>

459
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.490
<v Speaker 1>orgy of grief.</v>

460
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Soviet to simply couldn't imagine going on without their gaunt and father,</v>

461
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 1>but go on.</v>

462
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.080
<v Speaker 1>They did three years after Stalin's death,</v>

463
00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.190
<v Speaker 1>his eventual replacement,</v>

464
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Nikita Khrushchev gave an extraordinary speech at a closed session of the 20th</v>

465
00:19:23.481 --> 00:19:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Party Congress.</v>

466
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.080
<v Speaker 1>He said that while Stalin had been a great leader,</v>

467
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.380
<v Speaker 1>he had also committed terrible crimes against the Soviet people.</v>

468
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.360
<v Speaker 1>The Myth of the benevolence protective comrade leader was finally reveals for</v>

469
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:35.541
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

470
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:37.970
