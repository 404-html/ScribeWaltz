00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Hi was pile the top of the head often ornamented with jewels or trinkets.</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Her face was always made up and she wore the finest gowns and jewelry.</v>

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I was only 19 years old.</v>

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>She was already a queen and then the tumultuous times in which she lived,</v>

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>she soon became a symbol of all that was wrong with French royalty.</v>

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>So in the video today,</v>

7
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>let's explore the life of Mariam's.</v>

8
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>When asked the woman who was the face of rail access during the French</v>

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.353
<v Speaker 1>revolution</v>

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>then now inextricably linked with France and so on.</v>

11
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a native of the country,</v>

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 1>descended from the Habsburg line as she was born into royalty in Austria.</v>

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Marie Antoinette's entered the world in 1755 she was the daughter of the empress</v>

14
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 1>of Austria and the holy Roman emperor like many born into royalty,</v>

15
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>she had a lengthly name,</v>

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Maria Antonia Josepha.</v>

17
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Joanna growing up,</v>

18
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>she was educated by private tutors,</v>

19
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>are education focused on morality and religion.</v>

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.780
<v Speaker 1>This was typical at the time for an aristocratic females education,</v>

21
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>though she had a private tutor that works with her aunts when I was new,</v>

22
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>great shakes at academics.</v>

23
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

24
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>she could barely read and write her native German,</v>

25
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>much less the French that she also had to study.</v>

26
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>As one of her tutors described.</v>

27
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>She is rather lazy and extremely frivolous.</v>

28
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>She is hard to teach on swing as agree off during the seven years' war.</v>

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>She was only eight years old when it's ended,</v>

30
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>but the outcome of the conflict quite seriously effected how future you see.</v>

31
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>As the empress of Austria,</v>

32
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I was going to its mother where's the political leader at the end of the seven</v>

33
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>years war,</v>

34
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>it was in her best interest to keep an alliance between the French and the</v>

35
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Austrians ends in the 18th century.</v>

36
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>The best way to forge an alliance was three marriage,</v>

37
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>two years after the war ended when Antoinette,</v>

38
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>who is but 10 years old,</v>

39
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>her mother pegs the 11 year old ads to the French crown was at best about for a</v>

40
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>son in law.</v>

41
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>The necessary arrangements were amazing.</v>

42
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Does the age of only 14 Antoinette was married off into foreign royalty to Louie</v>

43
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>or Gusta ball ball.</v>

44
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Marie Antoinette's entry into France as a teenager.</v>

45
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a spectacular affair.</v>

46
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>A caravan was made up of nearly 60 carriage is accompanied by 117 footmen ends</v>

47
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>at 376 horses.</v>

48
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 1>The destination for this variable parade was a royal retreat in the forest</v>

49
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>outside of Paris,</v>

50
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but they had to make a stop as they approached the border with France.</v>

51
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Antoinette had to be dressed to look the part of French royalty.</v>

52
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I was pal does,</v>

53
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>her makeup was done,</v>

54
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>and she puts on a dress that matched the lavish expectations of the French</v>

55
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

56
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.933
<v Speaker 1>When they arrived,</v>

57
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Antoinette's showed herself to be just a teenager.</v>

58
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>She was impulsive ends,</v>

59
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>unable to control her excitement about being in a new place,</v>

60
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>about some meters,</v>

61
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be husbands rushing out of the carriage.</v>

62
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>She dashed up to the King of France and when she curtsied,</v>

63
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 1>he was charms,</v>

64
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>but the king's grandson.</v>

65
00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The future events,</v>

66
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>when ads did not share his birth through extroverted personality,</v>

67
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>he did not die shop to her around her arrival.</v>

68
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

69
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>he aversion desires gave her a quick formal kiss on the cheek and then stage</v>

70
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>

71
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

72
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and the king chattered away merrily one day off to Antoinette's as</v>

73
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:14.891
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>

74
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Louie the t were married the May the 16th 1770 wedding ceremony.</v>

75
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>It was held in the chapel of the famed palace of Versailles and it's when it's</v>

76
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>addressed was white and silver opulence gown dax out in diamonds,</v>

77
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but there was a major problem with the gown that it wasn't the right size for</v>

78
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.220
<v Speaker 1>any bride.</v>

79
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Discovering on your wedding day that your dress doesn't fit well,</v>

80
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>it would be a nightmare,</v>

81
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>but imagine being the future queen with all eyes of the court and the country</v>

82
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.964
<v Speaker 1>upon you.</v>

83
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>She didn't refresh,</v>

84
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

85
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>at least not publicly.</v>

86
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>She was expected to walk down the aisle and take the hands of Louis Bull on in</v>

87
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>

88
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>so that's what she did with our chef showing through the back of her dress in</v>

89
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>between rows of stone diamonds.</v>

90
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>The ceremony itself was a long mass and the grievant huddle on a dower</v>

91
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>expression for the entire time.</v>

92
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Then when it came to seal the contract with the signatures of the bride and</v>

93
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>groom Antwon as drip to ink on the signature,</v>

94
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>obscuring the name.</v>

95
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Doing so was considered bad luck for the marriage and things.</v>

96
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>While they didn't get any better,</v>

97
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>as the day went on,</v>

98
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>it was traditional in this era of a newlyweds to be followed to their bed</v>

99
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>chamber by a crowd.</v>

100
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>In the case of Amazon,</v>

101
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.421
<v Speaker 1>as in Louie,</v>

102
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>the crown's included royal dignitaries and an arch Bishop,</v>

103
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>the bishop gave the blessing and the crown dismissed as the couple disappeared</v>

104
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>behind drawn curtains and they undressed,</v>

105
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but as it would seem the entirety of Europe and the next day they didn't</v>

106
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>actually consummate the marriage as was expected of newlyweds and indeed for the</v>

107
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>next seven years.</v>

108
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>They didn't consummate the marriage.</v>

109
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

110
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a clear answer to why it took so long for the two to fulfill</v>

111
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>this marital obligation.</v>

112
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Historians have put forward theories to of those popular theories are that Louie</v>

113
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.640
<v Speaker 1>had phimosis they condition the men.</v>

114
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Sex was painful for him or it's simply that the two teenagers were just young</v>

115
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.174
<v Speaker 1>and it's confused,</v>

116
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but it did seem that the whole world knew about the lack of intimacy between the</v>

117
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>young royals and cleaning Antoinette's.</v>

118
00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Mother and [inaudible] mother regularly corresponded via letter and their</v>

119
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>discussions offer a glimpse into Antoinette's early years in the French court</v>

120
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and these reveals that she was very homesick.</v>

121
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.441
<v Speaker 1>Madame,</v>

122
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 1>my very dear mother,</v>

123
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I have not received one of your dear letters without having the tears come to my</v>

124
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>eyes and she disliked to the French customer royalty being attended to always.</v>

125
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I preserve my rouge and wash my hands in front of the whole world.</v>

126
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>She complained to her mother in a letter I love that spent time in her letters</v>

127
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>admonishing her daughter for her frivolous behavior at court as well as for not</v>

128
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>performing and Marisol obligations.</v>

129
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>In one letter she told Angela ads there's,</v>

130
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>in order to be a good wife,</v>

131
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>she needed to to lavish more caresses on Louis.</v>

132
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem might have been there.</v>

133
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Different schedules and lifestyles,</v>

134
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>big married.</v>

135
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>They lived two very different lives and so when as was,</v>

136
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>as are going and just social as ever,</v>

137
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a husband's remained quiet,</v>

138
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>avoiding the frivolities of course life that his wife so enjoyed the differences</v>

139
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>they graded on the marriage.</v>

140
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And so when that wrote to her friends,</v>

141
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>my tastes are not the same as the kings who is only interested in hunting and</v>

142
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 1>his metal working.</v>

143
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>He would often go to bed well before midnight while she was just getting started</v>

144
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>with her parties late into the night.</v>

145
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Then she'd wake up late morning after I'd already been up attending to his</v>

146
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>duties or studies from an early hour.</v>

147
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Eventually bans when it's brother were sent to France to talk to Louie.</v>

148
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear what ends when his brother said to Louie,</v>

149
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>but after that chat the couple was finally able to consummate their marriage.</v>

150
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>By the time of their marriage was consummated,</v>

151
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Louis' father had died and the two had been king and queen for three years and</v>

152
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>at this point she was just 21 years old</v>

153
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 1>as Queen Antoinette's tastes remains lavish much.</v>

154
00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you have mother's dismay and it almost pretentious letter her mother rose,</v>

155
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you lead a dissipated life.</v>

156
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I hope I shall not live to see if he disaster that is likely to ensue.</v>

157
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.570
<v Speaker 1>A hair itself was saying,</v>

158
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.881
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>

159
00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:01.590
<v Speaker 1>if our opulence with wigs and ornamentation piled feet at all of the heads,</v>

160
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.580
<v Speaker 1>I was silly,</v>

161
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>extravagantly done that she could even honey to tiny visas of water in this.</v>

162
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you keep the ornamental flowers fresh?</v>

163
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Audi,</v>

164
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.210
<v Speaker 1>a hairdresser became a cultural icon in his own right.</v>

165
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.870
<v Speaker 1>The women of the courts and of high society in Paris began emulating</v>

166
00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Antoinette's hairstyles.</v>

167
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Speaker 1>With morning women.</v>

168
00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Even going so far as do ornaments,</v>

169
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.810
<v Speaker 1>their towers of hair with earns her jewelry was also flashy to have a diamond</v>

170
00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:25.321
<v Speaker 1>bracelet.</v>

171
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's well worth as much as an entire mansion in Paris just getting dressed in</v>

172
00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:30.240
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>

173
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Was it literally a production?</v>

174
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.600
<v Speaker 1>One of Ann's when it's maids,</v>

175
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:37.200
<v Speaker 1>would hold up a book of fabric samples for her to help her decide what to wear.</v>

176
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Then she'd put on layers of undergarments,</v>

177
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.020
<v Speaker 1>including a frame.</v>

178
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:42.360
<v Speaker 1>If I'm the has scars it to emphasize her hips,</v>

179
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.781
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

180
00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:43.291
<v Speaker 1>it of course.</v>

181
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Then layers of fabric and then her dress again.</v>

182
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Mother did predictably and not approve.</v>

183
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.991
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

184
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I've always been of the opinion that fashion should be followed in moderation</v>

185
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 1>but should never be taken to extremes.</v>

186
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.220
<v Speaker 1>A beautiful young woman,</v>

187
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.360
<v Speaker 1>a graceful queen,</v>

188
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.370
<v Speaker 1>has no need for such madness.</v>

189
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>

190
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 1>simplicity of dress is more of a fitting and it's more worthy of a queen.</v>

191
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I love my little queen and watch everything you do and feel.</v>

192
00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I must not hesitate to draw your attention to this little frivolity.</v>

193
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.350
<v Speaker 1>The royal couple was living well and to showing it off,</v>

194
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but the people of France weren't sharing and the opulence and it's not all of</v>

195
00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:17.850
<v Speaker 1>the French population,</v>

196
00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:22.440
<v Speaker 1>was impressed with their new queens luxurious style in the late 1770s the</v>

197
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:23.340
<v Speaker 1>harvest in France,</v>

198
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:24.330
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't going well.</v>

199
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Green was it a premium prices were skyrocketing and farmers and peasants,</v>

200
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.153
<v Speaker 1>they were hurting.</v>

201
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 1>They were literally riots in the street over Brett.</v>

202
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 1>It is during these rights.</v>

203
00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:36.030
<v Speaker 1>That answer now is we're supposed to have said let them eat cake,</v>

204
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>but you never actually said this.</v>

205
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 1>That phrase was attributed to her much later in 1843 aunts when has may have</v>

206
00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:43.920
<v Speaker 1>never uttered that famously callous phrase,</v>

207
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but she certainly wasn't sympathetic to the plights of the peasants.</v>

208
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.820
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

209
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.410
<v Speaker 1>even as as subjects with suffering,</v>

210
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.570
<v Speaker 1>she continued spending even more.</v>

211
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.351
<v Speaker 1>She gambled down.</v>

212
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>She spent money to construct her own private retreat at the building known as</v>

213
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>the trine on already existed.</v>

214
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>That's when I though she needed to make it her own.</v>

215
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>She installed artificial rivers,</v>

216
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the Rotunda and a series of what appeared to be in rustic cottages.</v>

217
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Once inside it became clear they weren't anything but they were furnished in the</v>

218
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>typically comfortable style of the wealthy,</v>

219
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>complete with pool tables,</v>

220
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.111
<v Speaker 1>silk hangings,</v>

221
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and other ornate wall Waldeck or fine China in luxury furniture broads the cost</v>

222
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:21.760
<v Speaker 1>of the retreat to an astounding 2 million francs beyond the cost of the decker</v>

223
00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>and the property.</v>

224
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>The triathlon also caused other problems for Antoinette's among her subjects.</v>

225
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>People wondered why a Queen would need such a retreat,</v>

226
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 1>so they jumped to conclusions and began spreading rumors and gossip.</v>

227
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>The Queen,</v>

228
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 1>she was hosting men.</v>

229
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

230
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I've seen gatherings that to be happening at the Trianon.</v>

231
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Why else would she need a lavish getaway for just herself and to have friends?</v>

232
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>One rema,</v>

233
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.010
<v Speaker 1>it persisted and that was a vans.</v>

234
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>When it's a fan with the Swedish diplomat axle to fasten it in 2016 a team of</v>

235
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 1>researches announced their Dakota.</v>

236
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>The latter that showed Antwon ads and the person's relationship went beyond just</v>

237
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 1>discussing matters of state among Vindico did passages is this,</v>

238
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I will end this letter.</v>

239
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 1>There's knots without telling you my dear and gentle friends that I love you</v>

240
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>madly and that there is never a moment in which I do not adore you.</v>

241
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>The two that first been introduced in 1774 and saw each other more and more as</v>

242
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

243
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.670
<v Speaker 1>did more events at the French course.</v>

244
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to Europe for a time to find in the American revolution,</v>

245
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't,</v>

246
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 1>didn't the feelings between him then Antwon apps,</v>

247
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 1>another letter that survived the centuries has first and telling his sister that</v>

248
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>he could never marry because there's one true love was already taken.</v>

249
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>The Queen,</v>

250
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:28.551
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot.</v>

251
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 1>We're certainly giving the people of France a great deal to talk about</v>

252
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>discussions of Antwon out as eight traitors and our husbands and about half</v>

253
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 1>frivolity with money.</v>

254
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>We're spreading pamphlets distributed throughout France drawings an answer and</v>

255
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 1>as a company to set up words,</v>

256
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 1>shoving her in extravagant dresses.</v>

257
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>This very great ire towards her and the rest of the royal family</v>

258
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.270
<v Speaker 1>as the king and queen were acting as if nothing was different about life.</v>

259
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.200
<v Speaker 1>The people of France,</v>

260
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.150
<v Speaker 1>we're getting angrier band Sangria.</v>

261
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.540
<v Speaker 1>In 1789 king Louie had sent troops to a science.</v>

262
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Paris and French citizens were starting to worry it might be a move to dissolve</v>

263
00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the National Assembly.</v>

264
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.840
<v Speaker 1>In response,</v>

265
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.800
<v Speaker 1>900 Frenchmen descended upon Paris and stormed the Bastille prison.</v>

266
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.750
<v Speaker 1>They stole weapons and ammunition,</v>

267
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.840
<v Speaker 1>but the events was much more than the stockpiling of weapons.</v>

268
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.250
<v Speaker 1>It was a symbol of the people being ready to take on the powerful forces of the</v>

269
00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:27.970
<v Speaker 1>monarchy.</v>

270
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.500
<v Speaker 1>The Bastille was a fortress,</v>

271
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but it was also the prison weapon.</v>

272
00:11:31.271 --> 00:11:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Critical enemies were kept.</v>

273
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a symbol of the Monica use power.</v>

274
00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:35.290
<v Speaker 1>And by taking it over,</v>

275
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.350
<v Speaker 1>the people showed just how weak the monarchy could be.</v>

276
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.480
<v Speaker 1>The storming of the Bastille on July the 14 to 1789 is widely considered to be</v>

277
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.010
<v Speaker 1>the start of the French revolution and things were moving pretty fast.</v>

278
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.671
<v Speaker 1>By October,</v>

279
00:11:48.671 --> 00:11:51.700
<v Speaker 1>the crowds of revolutionaries and grown to thousands,</v>

280
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 1>10,000 French has gathered outside the PSI calling for the king and his queen to</v>

281
00:11:56.141 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>be dragged to Paris among them thousands of women who had marched miles from</v>

282
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

283
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And along the way they were joined by men with guns.</v>

284
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.740
<v Speaker 1>When they showed up outside the royal residents,</v>

285
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.031
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>

286
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know what to do.</v>

287
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>His first instinct was to escape,</v>

288
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>so we ordered his carriage is be prepared.</v>

289
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.200
<v Speaker 1>They were no match for the angry crowds.</v>

290
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.710
<v Speaker 1>The carriage were ruins and to Louis and just family remains trapped in the</v>

291
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>palace stay when much safer in selling though some of the crowds trying to get</v>

292
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>it down to an ads and they nearly succeeded to garbs were killed as the crowd</v>

293
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:27.240
<v Speaker 1>forced their way towards our quarters and so on.</v>

294
00:12:27.241 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>As it wasn't in the bedroom,</v>

295
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 1>though she had left the air and was safe in the dining rooms of Louise</v>

296
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>quarter's.</v>

297
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Soon after troops under the commands of Marquis de Lafayette arrived and were</v>

298
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 1>able to restore order.</v>

299
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>The piece was not to last though the crowds were able to capture the king and</v>

300
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 1>queen and forced them back to Paris in a procession led by the heads of their</v>

301
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 1>dead body guards,</v>

302
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.950
<v Speaker 1>which were hoisted up on Pike's throughout the crisis Antwon when ash was</v>

303
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:51.640
<v Speaker 1>meeting with ambassadors and writing letters to other European officials calling</v>

304
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 1>on them to help out the French monarchy that we meanwhile seems it's a loss for</v>

305
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 1>how to help.</v>

306
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1891 aided by the help of her lover to Ferguson and not Louis and swing</v>

307
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 1>that's put together plans and get the royal family out of France and away from</v>

308
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the danger of an angry at public.</v>

309
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.530
<v Speaker 1>The plan was to escape to the Netherlands where they could plot a counter</v>

310
00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

311
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Amazon has proved herself able to make decisions and plan,</v>

312
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>but when it came time for her to escape,</v>

313
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>her desire for luxury got in the way.</v>

314
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

315
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.410
<v Speaker 1>a French general had told the royals that their journey would be much safer if</v>

316
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.260
<v Speaker 1>they made it in to small and conspicuous carriages.</v>

317
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

318
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Antoinette's demanded that they use larger carriages that could be outfitted</v>

319
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:30.370
<v Speaker 1>with a full silver dinner service as well as a wine chest.</v>

320
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Also joining the royal family in their luxurious carriage was to [inaudible] the</v>

321
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 1>plan called for him to leave the royal family a short way into the journey,</v>

322
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.450
<v Speaker 1>then meets back up with them at their destination.</v>

323
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.480
<v Speaker 1>He wants it to to travel the whole way as part of their group to offer</v>

324
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:44.080
<v Speaker 1>protection,</v>

325
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>but Louie demanded you follow the plan and separate from the group.</v>

326
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after the person's departure from the group,</v>

327
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 1>they ran into trouble.</v>

328
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 1>A peasant's recognize the king and was able to muster up the crowds to attack</v>

329
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:54.994
<v Speaker 1>for carriage.</v>

330
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 1>They weren't dragged into a house and held captive.</v>

331
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they were allowed to return to Paris,</v>

332
00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>but still held captive.</v>

333
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>The French assembly allowed Louie to serve as king,</v>

334
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:05.950
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't really have any power and downs.</v>

335
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>When asked,</v>

336
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

337
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't much in favor of the assembly at all.</v>

338
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 1>She was actively working against them,</v>

339
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:14.710
<v Speaker 1>writing to officials throughout Europe about how terrible she thought the new</v>

340
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>constitution was.</v>

341
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 1>She was also pretty clear in how she felt about the members of the assembly</v>

342
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

343
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>describing them as a heap of black guards,</v>

344
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 1>madmen and beasts.</v>

345
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

346
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Larry heard also declared war on Austria,</v>

347
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>things they were falling apart all around aunts when asked and they were about</v>

348
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>to get a whole lot worse.</v>

349
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 1>In 1792 the French royal family was forced into the Medieval Temple Tower,</v>

350
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 1>fortress as they were held prisoner,</v>

351
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.850
<v Speaker 1>the millennium old Monica,</v>

352
00:14:40.851 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you're France was dissolved and a new French republic took its place as all this</v>

353
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>was going on outside.</v>

354
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>The royal family tried to live a somewhat normal life in prison that we in</v>

355
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Murray tutor their children chess and played instruments,</v>

356
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>but they will also trying to bring them the backs of power and there was this</v>

357
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 1>effort that ultimately undid her and Louie the couple that hit in the letters</v>

358
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 1>they received from foreign powers in a box inside the prison.</v>

359
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 1>When the correspondence was discovered,</v>

360
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Louie was dragged on trial.</v>

361
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.960
<v Speaker 1>He was ultimately sentenced to death with the revolutionary leader roles,</v>

362
00:15:09.961 --> 00:15:14.961
<v Speaker 1>p APP or claiming Louie must die so that the country may live on [inaudible] and</v>

363
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>the children were able to spend a few final hours with him before he met his</v>

364
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:22.590
<v Speaker 1>fate at the Guillotine with 20,000 Frenchmen looking on months later,</v>

365
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>that's when I had herself would be the one on the platform.</v>

366
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>After Louise Execution,</v>

367
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 1>she was brought to a new prison,</v>

368
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.940
<v Speaker 1>a prison with the dire nickname of death,</v>

369
00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Santa's chamber here.</v>

370
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Ray sympathetic military officer actually attempted to help her escape when his</v>

371
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:36.040
<v Speaker 1>efforts were uncovered bands,</v>

372
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>when ash was put on trial right away in order to avoid any danger of her</v>

373
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>escaping,</v>

374
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 1>she was charged with treason and theft and it was left up to a male jury to</v>

375
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:45.230
<v Speaker 1>decide her face.</v>

376
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>It only took two days for them to decide that she was guilty and she should be</v>

377
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>sentenced to death.</v>

378
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 1>The 37 year old queen made one final trip through the streets of Paris.</v>

379
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:53.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

380
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:54.231
<v Speaker 1>how Sean?</v>

381
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 1>In preparation for execution,</v>

382
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>she sat stoically in a carriage on the ride to the guillotine platform where she</v>

383
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 1>would ultimately meet her face.</v>

384
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>When she arrived at the platform,</v>

385
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 1>the priests told her to have courage.</v>

386
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>How response?</v>

387
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.110

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

390
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I shall lose it at the moments when my sufferings are to and from the moment she</v>

391
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 1>was born,</v>

392
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Marie Antoinette was destined to play a role on the world stage.</v>

393
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 1>How mother set her up for a powerful marriage and marriage that thrust her into</v>

394
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Speaker 1>the midst of the French revolution,</v>

395
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's made her the ultimate representation of the excesses of royalty.</v>

396
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 1>She was only alive for 37 years,</v>

397
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 1>but in that time,</v>
