<v Speaker 1>It's genius.</v>

8
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It extended beyond the music to words play ends,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you excited and inspired?</v>

<v Speaker 1>FBI,</v>

13
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>who was this British feed on?</v>

14
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that would be the inimitable John Lennon</v>

16
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>with bombs falling around the hospital.</v>

17
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>John Lennon was born on October the ninth 1940 in the midst of World War team.</v>

18
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>His mother Julia gave him the middle name at Winston in honor of Britain's</v>

19
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>leader at the time.</v>

20
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>

21
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Alfred,</v>

22
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>who was a merchant marine and was absent at John's.</v>

23
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Beth Messi would be for much of John's childhood.</v>

24
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Lennon's childhood was unsettled with an absent father and a mother who simply</v>

25
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>couldn't handle motherhood after the age of four.</v>

26
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Leonard didn't even live with his mother and instead of living with this</v>

27
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>childless uncle George and aren't many,</v>

28
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>the two where a stern but loving influence on Lennon at throughout his</v>

29
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

30
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>though many did what she could to discourage lemons,</v>

31
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.253
<v Speaker 1>love of music.</v>

32
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It was she who famously told him,</v>

33
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>because I was all very well John,</v>

34
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never make a living out of it.</v>

35
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Lennon's mother was more supportive of his musical interest.</v>

36
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

37
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>it was jr who bought the guitar for him though then and didn't live with his</v>

38
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:27.671
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

39
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>He remains close to her regularly visiting our house where the two we'd listen</v>

40
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>to Elvis records and pluck cords on the Banjo,</v>

41
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Ukulele and the guitar.</v>

42
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Juliet was also a frequent visitor at her sister's house where she spent</v>

43
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>mornings drinking tea with many and chatting with our son after one of these</v>

44
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:44.440
<v Speaker 1>tranquil visits.</v>

45
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.131
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

46
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>tragedy struck as Julie across the street to had home one day she was struck and</v>

47
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>killed by a passing car.</v>

48
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>John was 16 years old when his mother died and he carried the weight of the</v>

49
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>tragedy with him for the rest of his life.</v>

50
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

51
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.293
<v Speaker 1>Julia died.</v>

52
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was already having trouble in school.</v>

53
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 1>He was smart,</v>

54
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that,</v>

55
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>but his wit and attitudes got him into trouble with teachers.</v>

56
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>He created comics of teachers and fellow students in a worky titles of the</v>

57
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>daily.</v>

58
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 1>How and detention sheets from Courtney Bank high school show that Lennon at once</v>

59
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>received three to technicians in one day with offenses over the years,</v>

60
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 1>ranging from fighting in class to sabotage to just no interest whatsoever.</v>

61
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>While he was goofing off in school,</v>

62
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was paying close attention to his music.</v>

63
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was playing in a band called the Quarrymen and it was one of this band's</v>

64
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:33.520
<v Speaker 1>gigs that would ultimately lead to the formation of the Beatles.</v>

65
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>On July the sixth 1957 the Quarrymen played the Wilton village fate and it's one</v>

66
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>of Lennon span mates decided Lennon should be introduced to a friends of his as</v>

67
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

68
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 1>He wants that friends.</v>

69
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.373
<v Speaker 1>you might've heard of him,</v>

71
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>that friends.</v>

72
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>What was Paul Mccartney that day?</v>

73
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:47.381
<v Speaker 1>Mccartney,</v>

74
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>who was two years John's Jr taught Lennon at how to tune a guitar.</v>

75
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>He's impressed him with a rendition of the song,</v>

76
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>20 flights rock the atmosphere of the day stock with Paul,</v>

77
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>even if the exact year didn't I Walton village fate,</v>

78
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I him,</v>

79
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I was a fan of school boy and he leans in arm and my shoulder.</v>

80
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I realized he was drunk.</v>

81
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>We were 12 then,</v>

82
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but in spite of his sideboards,</v>

83
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>those sideburns,</v>

84
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>we went on to become teenage pals.</v>

85
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It was only two weeks before Paul was asked to join the Quarrymen bands.</v>

86
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He agreed.</v>

87
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

88
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Paul introduced to John and the other band members to his friend George</v>

89
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Harrison.</v>

90
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>It was 1958 and three of the four Beatles had already found each other,</v>

91
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>but music couldn't be John's only focus.</v>

92
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Though we had failed his exams.</v>

93
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Upon leaving high school Lennon's arms and former headmaster pulled strings and</v>

94
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.290
<v Speaker 1>persuaded the Liverpool College of art to accept the rambunctious team did show</v>

95
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>incredible promise in the arts.</v>

96
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Then started attending the livable college in art in the fall of 1957 I'll ended</v>

97
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>and fare much better in art school than he had in traditional school.</v>

98
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Though he did meet his first wife,</v>

99
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Cynthia pal Len.</v>

100
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Ernie never had the rise equipment for his classes and there was always</v>

101
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>borrowing pals tools.</v>

102
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>It was also up to pal to help lend and through his exams,</v>

103
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>which she ultimately fails for all the help she gave him and was not a kind and</v>

104
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>loving boyfriends upheld.</v>

105
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.641
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

106
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>he could be downright abusive.</v>

107
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Even acknowledging as much by nature saying I was sort of in a blind rage for</v>

108
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

109
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I was either drunk or fighting.</v>

110
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>It had been the same with other girlfriends out hat it was something the matter</v>

111
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

112
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>That relationship lasted though and in 1962 pal discovered she was pregnant with</v>

113
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Lennon's childs and keeping with the expectations of the time the two were</v>

114
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>married in a simple civil ceremony in Liverpool,</v>

115
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.791
<v Speaker 1>Lennon's music.</v>

116
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Korea had already taken priority over all else by this point and they skipped a</v>

117
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>honeymoon so he could play a Gig the night of their wedding.</v>

118
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Cynthia gave birth to Julian Lennon in 1963 and with the Beatles Star on the</v>

119
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>rise in Liverpool.</v>

120
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>John didn't pay much attention to his son.</v>

121
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.091
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

122
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>his relationship with his son where is no better than it was with his wife.</v>

123
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Something Julian publicly and angrily spoke about as an adult.</v>

124
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>He stated dad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world,</v>

125
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him,</v>

126
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>his wife and son.</v>

127
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.410
<v Speaker 1>How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces?</v>

128
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>No communication.</v>

129
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Adultery,</v>

130
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>divorce.</v>

131
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 1>John was the only married and the only one with the child and the group's</v>

132
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>manager trying to keep this information about Lennon underwraps as he marketed,</v>

133
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the group girls wanted their pop stars to be single and cute,</v>

134
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.953
<v Speaker 1>not married.</v>

135
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles rise to fame began at the Calvin club,</v>

136
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but it was interspersed with performances in Germany along with Lennon Mccartney</v>

137
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and Harrison bandmates,</v>

138
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Stu Sutcliffe and Pete best made up the bands lineup for their infamous stays in</v>

139
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Hamburg,</v>

140
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Germany at the Kaiser Keller Club.</v>

141
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.361
<v Speaker 1>The boys,</v>

142
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 1>no more than 22 and Giorgione 17 lived in horrid conditions and survived on only</v>

143
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>pills and alcohol during their state,</v>

144
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>but the audiences,</v>

145
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>they loved them,</v>

146
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>especially Lemons onstage antics.</v>

147
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.641
<v Speaker 1>One night.</v>

148
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to be on stage,</v>

149
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>but instead was fooling around with a woman and the two only broke up when the</v>

150
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>clubs bounce.</v>

151
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>It dumped cold water on them.</v>

152
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Instead of getting dressed to go onstage,</v>

153
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>letting them grabbed his guitar and joined his band mates.</v>

154
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Are you wearing underwear?</v>

155
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

156
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Toilet seat around his neck.</v>

157
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>When the Beatles returned to livable,</v>

158
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 1>then resumed playing at the Calvin Club.</v>

159
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>They caught the attention of a young record store owner in the area familiar</v>

160
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>with the group from their visits to his store.</v>

161
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Brian Epstein went to one of their performances where he saw that potential and</v>

162
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>signed on as their manager.</v>

163
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>He got them a record contract and it was by their side until his death.</v>

164
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:30.431
<v Speaker 1>In 1967 Epstein was gay and homosexuality was still illegal in England during</v>

165
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s over the years,</v>

166
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>rumors have persisted that Lennon Epstein had an Afab and largely stemming from</v>

167
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:36.951
<v Speaker 1>a vacation.</v>

168
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>The two took together in Spain in 1963 male weeks after his son was born.</v>

169
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>London deny the room is saying,</v>

170
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I was on holiday with Brian Epstein in Spain where the rumors went around is</v>

171
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>that he and I were having a lover fat.</v>

172
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It was almost a love affair,</v>

173
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>but not quite.</v>

174
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It was never consummated,</v>

175
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>but it was a pretty intense relationship.</v>

176
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I only 1964 the Beatles were hitting the airwaves in America.</v>

177
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Then on February the seventh 1964 their plane touched down at the newly renamed</v>

178
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy Airport in New York City.</v>

179
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Crowds of teenagers greeted them,</v>

180
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>hanging over the railings,</v>

181
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>screaming and waving signs when they made their way through the crowds to speak</v>

182
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>to the press,</v>

183
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Lennon treated the American media to a dose of his classic West.</v>

184
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>When a reporter asked why people love the Beatles so much and replied,</v>

185
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>if we knew we'd form another group and to be managers.</v>

186
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Two years later,</v>

187
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.830
<v Speaker 1>the lads from Liverpool made their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show.</v>

188
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>As the studio audiences screamed and 73 million Americans watched from home.</v>

189
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>The Beatles performed five songs during the show.</v>

190
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Each Beatles name appeared on the screen.</v>

191
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Then Ann's name had an addendum though it red,</v>

192
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>sorry girls.</v>

193
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>He's married.</v>

194
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Keith think Cynthia and Julius existence quiet.</v>

195
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>It was not possible for a man who was about to become one of the most</v>

196
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>recognizable people in the world.</v>

197
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.580
<v Speaker 1>1964 it saw the release of both the movie and the album,</v>

198
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 1>a hard day's night marking all four Beatles foray into the film industry.</v>

199
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Lennon would later repair and satirical film called how I won the war,</v>

200
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 1>not to be constrained by only two artistic mediums then and also published a</v>

201
00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 1>book in 1964 in titled in his own right,</v>

202
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.750
<v Speaker 1>which he later followed up with the volume entitled a Spaniard in the works as</v>

203
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the 60s continued on that these all stayed at the top of the pop culture world</v>

204
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's high profile meant that or Lennon's mouth can get him and the band</v>

205
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 1>into trouble pretty easily.</v>

206
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.120
<v Speaker 1>In 1966 he famously told a reporter that the Beatles were more popular than</v>

207
00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:33.954
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

208
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 1>When the remark was published,</v>

209
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it caused an uproar.</v>

210
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Socorro's beetle burnings were held around the United States during which teens</v>

211
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>and their parents burned albums,</v>

212
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>photos and other Beatles memorabilia.</v>

213
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>1967 was the year that the Beatles took a rock and roll to new heights with a</v>

214
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>release of sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band psychedelic concept album</v>

215
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>that featured a collage of historic figures and celebrities on its cover.</v>

216
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Initially Jesus where it's supposed to be among those pictured in the artwork,</v>

217
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>but after Lennon's 1966 remarks,</v>

218
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:13.650
<v Speaker 1>he was removed from the Ra,</v>

219
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the songs on sergeant peppers with Lucy in the sky with diamonds and it</v>

220
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>has long been thought to be drug related as the major words in the title or</v>

221
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>create the acronym Lsd.</v>

222
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.600
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

223
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Lenin said that his inspiration for the songs imagery,</v>

224
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it came from one of his favorite works of literature,</v>

225
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Alice in Wonderland.</v>

226
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>The overall idea stemming from one of Julian's challenge had drawings of a</v>

227
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>school friend named Lucy during this time period,</v>

228
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Landon and began moving and avant garde artistic circles primarily due to his</v>

229
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.740
<v Speaker 1>new relationship with artists,</v>

230
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Yoko Ono.</v>

231
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>He had met ono,</v>

232
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 1>which one of her gallery shows and at the time that they're meeting consisted</v>

233
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.190
<v Speaker 1>solely of her handing him a card that said nothing but breathe on us.</v>

234
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Let them,</v>

235
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>we're still married to Cynthia.</v>

236
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.231
<v Speaker 1>He had don't know,</v>

237
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>began spending time together.</v>

238
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Even recording an album calls two virgins that featured both of them standing</v>

239
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.680
<v Speaker 1>fully nude on the coverup.</v>

240
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Lennon and Cynthia did not officially divorced until 1968 though the</v>

241
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Ono and Lennon was well known.</v>

242
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:06.811
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

243
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Spending time in the recording studio is the Beatles worked and even lend her</v>

244
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:15.531
<v Speaker 1>voice to the white album song bungalow bill in 1969 Lennon and oh no married in</v>

245
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:19.380
<v Speaker 1>a ceremony at the rock of Gibraltar and events that was famously chronicled in</v>

246
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the song,</v>

247
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>the ballad of John and Yoko.</v>

248
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 1>It goes like this and no,</v>

249
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to try and sing it cause you really don't want to hear that.</v>

250
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Finally made the plane into Paris.</v>

251
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Honeymooning down by the Sen Peter Brown called to say,</v>

252
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.021
<v Speaker 1>you can make it.</v>

253
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

254
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.</v>

255
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>While that wedding was a relatively isolated fat,</v>

256
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>they welcomed the wells to their honeymoon.</v>

257
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Yoko and Lennon set up camp in a bed in the Amsterdam Hilton in order to promote</v>

258
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>world peace lying in bed,</v>

259
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>fully clothed for a week.</v>

260
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>They repeated this done two weeks later in Montreal and it was at the Montreal</v>

261
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>bed in that they recorded give peace,</v>

262
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>a chance surrounded by members of the press and other friends and followers.</v>

263
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>By this time that Lennon was fully dedicated to his life with Ono and each of</v>

264
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles had started to move in their own directions.</v>

265
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I know his presence in the recording studio mentor in Bhutan,</v>

266
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.800
<v Speaker 1>the music,</v>

267
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 1>because of the other Beatles.</v>

269
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>And so they also had begun exploring different artistic worlds.</v>

270
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>The disintegration of the world's most famous bands.</v>

271
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

272
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.093
<v Speaker 1>it had begun.</v>

273
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was the first of the Beatles to tell them that he was leaving the group.</v>

274
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And he did this in September of 1969 but it was Paul Mccartney who broke the</v>

275
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>news to the world publicly that he was leaving.</v>

276
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.980
<v Speaker 1>And the beetle officially split on April the 10th 1970</v>

277
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.690
<v Speaker 1>though he had left the Beatles behind.</v>

278
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Lennon did not abandon music.</v>

279
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.020
<v Speaker 1>His first post Beatles album was released in 1970 with many of the songs</v>

280
00:11:47.021 --> 00:11:49.270
<v Speaker 1>inspired by the primal scream therapy.</v>

281
00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 1>He had began practicing as a method of dealing with the trauma he had</v>

282
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 1>experienced his childhood.</v>

283
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 1>The song that perhaps most demonstrates the influence of primal scream.</v>

284
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>There's mother,</v>

285
00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 1>which includes the lyrics.</v>

286
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Mother,</v>

287
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:00.881
<v Speaker 1>you had me,</v>

288
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but I never had you.</v>

289
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I wanted you.</v>

290
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want me,</v>

291
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>so I just got to tell you goodbye.</v>

292
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.</v>

293
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>By the time lending released his next solo album,</v>

294
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:09.911
<v Speaker 1>he ends,</v>

295
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:10.271
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

296
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 1>we're living in the United States settling into the luxurious Dakota or</v>

297
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>apartment building in New York City.</v>

298
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It was here that he wrote the most iconic of his solo works and that would be,</v>

299
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>imagine the song as the album.</v>

300
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 1>There were huge hits in nearly 40 years after Lennon's death.</v>

301
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>The song remains an international anthem of peace and love.</v>

302
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.941
<v Speaker 1>Now let her,</v>

303
00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:29.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

304
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:29.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

305
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:29.411
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

306
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>They enjoy living in New York City,</v>

307
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but the US government did not enjoy having the counter culture icons in the</v>

308
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>midst of the largest American metropolis in 1972 18 year olds would have the</v>

309
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 1>right to vote for the first time and 18 year olds.</v>

310
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.990
<v Speaker 1>They listened to John Lennon when they sang and spoke about the evils of war and</v>

311
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>the actions of the government that made him a threat to Richard Nixon's</v>

312
00:12:50.591 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>reelection and in 1972 the government revoked Lennon's visa based on these</v>

313
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>

314
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but they threatened his deportation and not wanting to be separated from owner.</v>

315
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Lennon essentially stopped his involvements with counter cultural activities,</v>

316
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 1>but as threats of deportation continued then and was forced to hire attorneys</v>

317
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 1>and continuously appeal to stay in the country.</v>

318
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>In 1976 only after the Nixon presidency fell apart under the pressure of</v>

319
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Watergate,</v>

320
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 1>did Lennon receive his green card and we're safe to stay in the United States</v>

321
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 1>during this struggle to obtain his green card.</v>

322
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was also struggling with his relationship with the team essentially</v>

323
00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 1>separated for over a year and it's Lennon even moved out to California to live</v>

324
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>with a former secretary may Pang with whom?</v>

325
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:31.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

326
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:32.111
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

327
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Had encouraged him to begin a relationship lender later referred to this period</v>

328
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:41.011
<v Speaker 1>of his life as the last weekend as it was fueled by alcohol and drugs and marked</v>

329
00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 1>by aggressive behavior from Lennon.</v>

330
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.520
<v Speaker 1>He wants even trying to strangle pang and it's got thrown out of a club fed</v>

331
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 1>drunkenly heckling the smothers brothers from Lennon's absence.</v>

332
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I know realized that she needed him in her life.</v>

333
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.340
<v Speaker 1>She ultimately came to blend society's pressures and not him telling playboy.</v>

334
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 1>John was a fine person.</v>

335
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It was society that has become too much.</v>

336
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm thankful to John's intelligence that he was intelligent enough to know this</v>

337
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:05.920
<v Speaker 1>was the only way that we could save our marriage.</v>

338
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Not because we didn't love each other better because it was getting too much for</v>

339
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:10.330
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

340
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 1>When the two reunited,</v>

341
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I knew quickly became pregnant.</v>

342
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth to you,</v>

343
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Sean Lennon on John's 35th birthday on October the ninth 1975 with the birth of</v>

344
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Sean came a sea change in Lennon's life where he had been an absent father to</v>

345
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Julian.</v>

346
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a doting father to Shawn giving up a music and instead spending his time</v>

347
00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>as a house husband.</v>

348
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Let an also began spending time with Julian again during the 1970s Julian</v>

349
00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>visited New York and then taught his first son guitar techniques for five years,</v>

350
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.040
<v Speaker 1>then focused on domestic life,</v>

351
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>but by 1980 he felt the tug of the artistic muse.</v>

352
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:42.934
<v Speaker 1>Once again.</v>

353
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>He began writing songs,</v>

354
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>recording an album,</v>

355
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 1>and officially reentering the music scene with the release of double fantasy in</v>

356
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the fall of 1980 John Lennon while he was back,</v>

357
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.983
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

358
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

359
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.470
<v Speaker 1>it was not to last two months after double fantasy was released then.</v>

360
00:15:07.471 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

361
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.691
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

362
00:15:07.691 --> 00:15:07.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

363
00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:08.131
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

364
00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Headed to the recording studio to work on new songs that they had written on</v>

365
00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:16.710
<v Speaker 1>their way to the studio and then stops to sign a copy of double fantasy for Mark</v>

366
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>David Chapman,</v>

367
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.890
<v Speaker 1>a fan who is waiting outside the Dakota on their return.</v>

368
00:15:19.891 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Shortly before 11:00 PM Chapman was still waiting outside the Dakota building as</v>

369
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:24.361
<v Speaker 1>the lender.</v>

370
00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:24.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

371
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:24.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

372
00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:24.841
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

373
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Walked by Chapman,</v>

374
00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>pulls a gun and fired five shots at Lennon and hysterical,</v>

375
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:29.341
<v Speaker 1>oh No.</v>

376
00:15:29.341 --> 00:15:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Called for help and the NYP d arrived.</v>

377
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Officers loaded the winded Lennon into the back of a cruiser and drove him to</v>

378
00:15:34.981 --> 00:15:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the Roosevelt Hospital.</v>

379
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

380
00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:37.170
<v Speaker 1>their efforts,</v>

381
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.003
<v Speaker 1>they were fruitless.</v>

382
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.180
<v Speaker 1>John Lennon was declared dead on arrival at 11:00 PM December the eighth 1980</v>

383
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the United States had the news viral Monday night football broadcast and the</v>

384
00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:49.410
<v Speaker 1>news quickly made it to the rest of the world's crowds began to show up at the</v>

385
00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Dakota singing Lennon songs and carrying signs in his memory.</v>

386
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.480
<v Speaker 1>No funeral was held instead.</v>

387
00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:54.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

388
00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:57.960
<v Speaker 1>How does body cremated and scattered his ashes in central park,</v>

389
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the location now called strawberry fields,</v>

390
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.290
<v Speaker 1>is a memorial dedicated to Lennon that is visited by legions of fans.</v>

391
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Every year.</v>

392
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.640
<v Speaker 1>John Lennon's public life was dedicated to art and the promotion of peace,</v>

393
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.210
<v Speaker 1>but his private life was quite a bit more complicated and dramatic.</v>

394
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.570
<v Speaker 1>What is certain is that there is no doubt that he holds a special place in the</v>

395
00:16:15.571 --> 00:16:17.790
<v Speaker 1>lives of those who grew up with him and his music,</v>

396
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.810
<v Speaker 1>as well as the children and grandchildren of those baby boomers who have come to</v>

397
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.670
<v Speaker 1>love his music and his legacy.</v>

398
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.440
<v Speaker 1>A groundbreaking musician and experimental artist then turned his private pain</v>

399
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.670
<v Speaker 1>into beauty for the world.</v>

400
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:34.110
<v Speaker 1>His legacy has lived on for decades after his death and surely will continue to</v>

401
00:16:34.111 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>live on long after we're all gone.</v>
