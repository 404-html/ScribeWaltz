And let's get into APP.
Actually,
before we get into it,

6
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.860
I just want to say that there are French pronunciations in this one.
Indeed,

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.370
the man's name himself shall Dougal.
Uh,
that's,

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:24.990
I believe how you pronounce it in French.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.350
I'm going to go with the accepted English pronunciation of Charles de goal

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.680
because it's easier for me unless like to describe it up.

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.800
There's also other French pronunciations.
If you don't like it,

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.920
deal with it all up.
Just have a go at me in the comments below.

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.090
I'm not going to read them.

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.730
Charles to go was the sort of man who turned heads at six foot five inches in

15
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.061
height.

16
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:55.400
He towered over his contemporaries and with his regal bearing and from gays,

17
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:59.970
he exuded an APP,
a fourth right self confidence throughout his life.

18
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:01.890
His unswerving love for France,

19
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:04.980
coupled with his determination to right the wrongs of the past,

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.090
turned him into a hero of the resistance movement and one of the fringe

21
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.480
republics.
Truly great statesman.
In today's biographics,

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.990
we examine the very full life of Charles to goal.

23
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.033
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.201
<v 0>Charles Andre.</v>

25
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:28.160
Joseph Murray to goal was born on November the 22nd 1819 he was the third of

26
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.860
five children to Henri and genre to goal.

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.820
Henri was a military man who had served in the Franco Prussian war by the time

28
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:35.870
his second son was born.

29
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:40.610
He was a teacher at a Catholic school in the French industrial region of Lille.

30
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.470
Shortly after the birth of trials,

31
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:47.471
the family moved to Paris on Rita got the position as the headmaster of the

32
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.100
Jesuit College of the Immaculate Conception.

33
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.010
Andre was a lover of history and the glory of France.

34
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.120
Nights in the goal home would often be spends with the children gathered around

35
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:57.590
to listen to their father,

36
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.310
regale them with stories of the country's history and the past of their

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.660
ancestors have played in it.

38
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.150
Charles would later recall the stories his father would tell them about their

39
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.490
most famous ancestor Sewell,
Johan to Google,

40
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.230
a knight who fought against the English at the battle of [inaudible],

41
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.680
the glorious history of his nation that Charles was learning at the feet of his

42
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:20.240
father,
came with a distrust of the country's natural enemy of the British.

43
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.690
Henri would not allow his children to learn the English language.
Charles,

44
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.910
his mother,
jome loved to a country more than a husband's Charlotte's,

45
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.100
which later to say that she had an uncompromising love for his country that was

46
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.370
equal to a rented just piety the defeat of France.

47
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.840
So the bachelor of Sedona in 1870 during the Franco Prussian war was a source of

48
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:42.200
humiliation for all fringe patriots,
including the goals.

49
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.520
They see that with the desire to avenge the shame that had folded upon their

50
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:47.540
once mighty nation,

51
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.440
they kept this ambition alive in their children with Henri irregularly taking

52
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:55.370
them to the cemetery at Liberal Shay and having them read aloud the inscription

53
00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.490
to the dead of 1870 the SORTA fronds broken their Valliant hands will once more

54
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.430
be reformed by their descendants.

55
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.640
Even though he wasn't the smartest of the five to gold children.

56
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.470
Charles was then natural leader.

57
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.460
He adds a mischievous dominant attitude and he was always organizing some sort

58
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.570
of practical joke on one of his siblings when he was about six he invented his

59
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.450
own language which involved speaking French backwards.

60
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.770
He forced his brothers and sisters to learn it naturally objectives because his

61
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.440
insistence paid off and they all became fluent at it.

62
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.760
This was an early sign of the determination and persistent force of character

63
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.150
that would come to be a trademark of Charles is an adult

64
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.960
like most French boys.
Charles Love to play soldiers.

65
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.500
Yet when he and his brothers lined up that model armies on the bedroom floor,

66
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.490
he would exhibit a seriousness and intensity than two went way beyond the

67
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:51.300
childhood game.

68
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.050
He always insisted on portraying the French army and would become cold and

69
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:58.950
dispassionate to during the war games as he put his total energies into

70
00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:01.920
defeating the enemy.
Charles attended the Jesuit College.

71
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.510
His father was the head Masdar.

72
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.110
He was a keen students who love to read and developed an early interest in

73
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:07.890
philosophy.

74
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.910
By the age of 10 though he had decided that he was going to pursue a life in the

75
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:13.530
military.
From that point onward,

76
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.970
Charles was single minded in his military focus at the age of 15 he wrote an

77
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:22.810
essay in which he projected himself forward to the year 1930 whereas general,

78
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:25.980
the goal,
he led the French army in defeating the Germans.

79
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.450
Finally inflicting vengeance for the defeat of 1870 Charles was determined to

80
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:34.380
win a place at the military academy.
Saul Sia has hard work at school.

81
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.770
It paid off and it was accepted into the academy in 1909 however,

82
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.550
prospective offices were required to serve a year in the ranks before entering

83
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:42.750
officer training school.

84
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.100
And so in October of 1909 he was enlisted into the 33rd Infantry Regiment

85
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.330
stationed at harass.
Four months later,
he won his first promotion to corporal.

86
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.050
It was usual for an aspiring officer to reach the rank of sergeant during the

87
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:58.030
first year,
but the goal was company commander,
captain to,

88
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.330
I refuse to bestow this rank upon him.

89
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.000
When asked why he had not been promoted to guy commented,

90
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.610
where do you have to be nominated to sergeants,

91
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:09.570
a boy who would only be at his ease as the grand constable in reflecting upon

92
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:13.920
this time with a 33rd infantry to go later made the rye remark that the most

93
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:17.730
valuable lesson he had gotten from his first year in the ranks was that if you

94
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.960
did the exact opposite of what you were told to do by the noncommissioned

95
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.580
officers,
you would get on fairly well.

96
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.310
And to the Military Academy of Saul Sia in autumn of 1910 he quickly and

97
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.890
reputation as an arrogant dandy with an air of superiority.

98
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.780
Two nicknames quickly became attached to him.
No shall Angela gras or Spi Edge.

99
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.530
This last title translates as the great asparagus and wizards.

100
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:50.970
I'm hardly a reference to his stature.
That's six foot five inches in height.

101
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:53.370
He towered over virtually everyone that he met.

102
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.340
One of his classmates was the future's general Belvoir commander,

103
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.360
a French troops,
the 1940s battle of Norway.

104
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.200
He remembered the goal as a mediocre students.
He had few friends.

105
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.470
The fact that he graduated 13,000 of his class of 211 in 1912 seems to indicate

106
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.960
that he was somewhat more than mediocre.

107
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.900
It was expected that a young man with the ambition of the goal would be chosen

108
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:18.980
to join a cavalry regiment is that was traditionally the fastest route to

109
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:20.780
promotion through the ranks.
How are that?

110
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.290
Charles had already come to the conclusion that the days of the horse soldiers

111
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.153
they were over.

112
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.600
He believes that future wars would be won by the infantry as a resulting made

113
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:33.500
the decisions you've returned to the 33rd infantry at harass to gold spent the

114
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:36.140
next two years learning the craft of an army officer.

115
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.980
It didn't take long for that lengthy officer to make an impression,

116
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.830
and the town of her Ross heads turned when he passed by with people being

117
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:46.610
captivated by both his extraordinary heit and his regal bearing.

118
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.110
Yet his rather caustic,

119
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.030
cold nature repelled more than his impressive appearance attracted not long

120
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:57.050
after de Gaulle's arrival at harass the 33rd received a new commanding officer,

121
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.040
Colonel Phillip Popol.
Charles develops a great deal of respect for baton.

122
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.990
In his memoirs,
he wrote my first kernel.
Patar taught me the art of command,

123
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.360
but home was also impressed with the goal.

124
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.800
In October of 1913 he recommended his first promotion,
so first lieutenant

125
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.830
when war broke out in August of 1914 the 33rd infantry regimen does part of the

126
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.500
French fifth army was deployed to dinner in order to host the tram in advance

127
00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:32.380
throughout that region to goal was immediately into the action with his first

128
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:34.840
engagements.
On August the 15th being the battle of denial,

129
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.080
he was wounded in the knee and sent to the hospital to recover.

130
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.190
When he returned to the regimens in October,
many of his men and hello officers,

131
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.060
they were dead.
Two months later,
he was promoted to regimental advertisements.

132
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.470
The 33rd inventory regimen became famous for that ability to crawl out into no

133
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.360
man's lands in order to spy on the enemy.

134
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.410
The intelligence gathered from this work at one to gold,
the quad,
a good metal.

135
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.380
In February,
1915 he was promoted to captain the following month.

136
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.100
Then inconsequential hand wound would become infected.

137
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:05.710
Leaving him out of action for the next four months.

138
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.430
During the battle of [inaudible] in March of 1916 the goal was winded in the

139
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.270
left thigh by a bear,
nat,

140
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.220
and subsequently captured after passing out from the effects of poison gas.

141
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.750
The goal spent the remainder of the war in a German prisoner of war camp the

142
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:20.650
attempted to escape five times.

143
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.020
He attempted escape by hiding in a laundry basket,

144
00:08:23.021 --> 00:08:27.040
digging a tunnel of digging a hole through a wall and even posing as a nurse in

145
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:30.100
order to fool the gods and letters that he wrote to his parents during his

146
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:30.561
captivity.

147
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:34.120
He expressed his great frustration that he was unable to participate in the war

148
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:34.960
at any longer.

149
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.580
He referred to himself as being cuckolded and fell into a state of depression

150
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.660
following the armistice in 1918 he was released and returned to his parents'

151
00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:46.150
home and door doin in the south of France

152
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.220
and only 1920 the goal was posted to Poland,

153
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.460
part of the French military mission deponents that he served as an instructor to

154
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:02.140
the Polish infantry.
He served with distinction,

155
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.090
I think the rank of major in the Polish army and being awarded the distinguished

156
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.800
two team military parlance,
highest military decoration here.

157
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.770
It sounds of France in 1921 and spent a year as a military history lecturer at

158
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:14.880
the South Sierra Academy.

159
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.260
He then spent two years studying at the Ecole Minute Tya in Paris.

160
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.790
He graduated with a grade of Sabr or good enough and was then posted to the

161
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:28.380
Rhineland area of Germany which was under French occupation during the mid 1920s

162
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:32.910
to go worked as a ghostwriter for his old commander at Eros the now Marshall

163
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:34.620
Bhutan in 1926 however,

164
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:37.860
the two had a falling out over a book on the history of the French soldier that

165
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.940
the goal had ghost written called Lasalle da.
In October of that year,

166
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:46.530
he returned to the brine to commence his military duties that in 1927 after a

167
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:50.010
dozen years in the army,
the goal was promoted to come on dot.

168
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.940
He was then posted to the occupying forces at Tria in Germany at the heads of

169
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:57.930
the 19th Shasta Rpa,
which was a light infantry battalion.

170
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.900
Co was a hard task master on his soldiers,

171
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.600
often pushing them beyond what was reasonable.
On one occasion,

172
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.780
he goes into hot water for throwing a soldier into prison for exercising his

173
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:10.410
right to appeal to as member of parliament for a transfer to a less demanding

174
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.810
units.
Even though he had had a falling out with patrol.

175
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.830
He called in his old commander to help get him out of the mess with the ends of

176
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:21.150
the allied occupation in the Rhineland in 1929 to goal was posted to Lebanon and

177
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:21.750
Syria.

178
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.140
He served with distinction with his commanding officer providing him with an

179
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:29.820
impressive recommendation when he returned to France in 1931 he then received a

180
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:34.260
posting to the general secretary out of the Supreme War Council based in Paris.

181
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.520
His job description was as a drafting officer for the next six years to gold

182
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:41.850
gained valuable experience in military bureaucracy.
Over that time,

183
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:45.390
he worked with government officials in drafting bills ready to do the military.

184
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.750
He worked on a bill for the Organization of France during the event of war,

185
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.840
but it did not pass the Senate throughout this period.

186
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:56.430
The goal was not shy about voicing his opinion on the military preparations that

187
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:59.040
France was making and the events of another European war.

188
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.850
He considered the line of fortifications known as the Maginot Line on which

189
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:07.020
billions of dollars were being spent to be a wasted effort rather than focusing

190
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:08.190
on a defensive footing.

191
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:12.720
He contended that the French needed to be proactive through mechanized warfare.

192
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.700
That was fast moving.
In 1934 he wrote a book called toward a professional army,

193
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.481
and it's the outline,

194
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:23.481
just plans for the future French army with 100,000 men and 3000 tanks in 1937 to

195
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:28.410
goal came a step closer to realizing this ambition when he was giving commands

196
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.910
of the 507th tank regimens with his promotion of the tank as the key to French

197
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:34.020
infantry success.

198
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.820
He became a nationally known figure with people calling him Colonel Motors.

199
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.520
Now,
just before we get into his later military career,

200
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.430
I do want to tell you about today's sponsor of war thunder.

201
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.640
They're fantastic because they sponsor longer videos like this and we can really

202
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:52.020
dive deep into a subject.
So war thunder is a realistic free to play combat game.

203
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.320
And if you're fancy your own kernel motors,
then why not give it a try?

204
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.410
It always amazes me when I hear that there are millions of players on these

205
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:00.640
online games,
but then again,

206
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.940
I see why it's amazing what games are like these days.

207
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.360
You can look at it right now.
I mean,
it looks incredible and it's free.

208
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:12.130
So why not?
In this game,
there are over 1,200 historically accurate vehicles.

209
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.080
There are tanks,
aircraft ships,

210
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:17.320
and just incredible vehicles from the 1930s onwards.
Indeed,

211
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.300
I'm just about to talk about a French tank,

212
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:23.080

217

and let's get back to it

218
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.660
with the French Declaration of war upon Germany in September of 1939 the goal

219
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.630
was put in command of the fifth army's five tank battalions,

220
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.970
mostly equipped with our 35 light tanks.

221
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:14.110
In early 1940 he lobbied for the position of Secretary General of the war

222
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:16.810
council,
the government's top military advisor,

223
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.010
but he was passed over towards the end of March,

224
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.590
1940 the gold was given command of the newly created Fourth Armored Division

225
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.740
with the German attack on May the 10th the fourth armored.

226
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.460
They went into action on May the 17th they encountered the Germans atom encore

227
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.840
ne.
It was a disaster,

228
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.841
but to goal with 23 of his 90 tanks being destroyed by mine's anti tank weapons

229
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:40.240
dive bomber and ground attack aircraft.
Two days later,

230
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.650
his reinforced division was decimated for a second time just by being ordered to

231
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:48.070
withdraw.
He fought on demanding even more reinforcements.

232
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.780
Even through this request was denied.

233
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.820
He managed to push the Germans back to call mark,

234
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.960
but this was only a temporary respite on May the 20th to gold began to referees

235
00:13:55.961 --> 00:14:00.070
in the face of the unstoppable German advance on May the 21st he was promoted to

236
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:01.060
brigadier general.

237
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.770
On May the 28th the led an attack on a German bridge headed Advil which captured

238
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:09.670
some 400 prisoners by the beginning of June to gold had been recalled to Paris

239
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.940
where he was offered until you accepted the position of undersecretary of state

240
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:16.630
for national defense of walk on June the eighth that's where the army commander

241
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:20.530
in chief wagons who was about to announce the French surrender when to gold,

242
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:22.650
tried to convince him to fight on vegans.

243
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.640
Laughs despairingly the following day to golf flew to London where he matched

244
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.050
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time.

245
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.990
His attempts to convince Churchill to put more RF fighters into the battle for

246
00:14:32.991 --> 00:14:35.980
France fell on deaf ears.
Upon his return to Paris,

247
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:40.120
he wanted to defend the city to the last man,
but Wagan had other ideas.

248
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.840
The government was relocated to tour where a series of meetings with British

249
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:47.580
officials were held during these meetings.
Gold's fighting resolve in press.

250
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:51.710
The Brits standing in stark contrast with other French leaders on during the SEC

251
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:55.160
for the goal was back in London discussing the logistics of a troop withdrawal

252
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:58.160
to French north Africa.
When he returned to France,
later that day,

253
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:02.120
you discover the Prime Minister Renzi had resigned to be replaced by Marshall

254
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.030
Patah,
who was intent on signing an artist is with the Germans.

255
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.450
The goal now it fled France for London,
the head of the jam and takeover.

256
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.500
On June the 18th Churchill offered him ads.

257
00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:14.600
I'm on BBC radio to address the French people in the speech,
the golden courage,

258
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:16.820
this country men to be brave during the occupation,

259
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.570
resisting it as best they could.
The next day he gave another broadcast.

260
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.230
This time he was more critical of the Bhutan government denouncing it as

261
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.093
illegitimate.

262
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.610
On during the 20 seconds following the signing of the armistice to gold took to

263
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:29.480
the BBC again.

264
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.020
He denounced the surrender and again declared the French government's

265
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:33.800
illegitimates.

266
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.160
On June the 28th the British government recognized the goal as the leader of

267
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:41.000
free France has governments in exile,
consisted of three Connell's,

268
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:45.010
12 captains and three battalions of legionnaires over the following months.

269
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.240
The goals main weapon was BBC radio.

270
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.690
He would give broadcasts and average of three times per month denouncing the

271
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:54.470
occupation government based in Vishaan's urging Frenchmen to resist the

272
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:55.160
occupation,

273
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.790
the Bhutan government sentence to gold to death in absentia on the warriors.

274
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.850
The goal was able to slowly build up the free French army.

275
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.170
On April the 21st 1943 he boarded a plane en route to Scotland to inspectors

276
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:06.740
navy.

277
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.190
The plane almost crashed on take off and it was later found that it had been

278
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:11.720
sabotaged using acid.

279
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.490
In May of 1943 the gold moved his headquarters to fringe Algiers where he became

280
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:18.950
the head of the French Committee of national liberation.

281
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.770
He became involved in the planning for the d day invasion.

282
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.190
Although the Americans and British became increasingly frustrated with his

283
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:27.980
insistence that he was the rightful leader of France.

284
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.130
He was hounded prison on June the fourth of 1944 whereupon trach.

285
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:33.050
I lost him to address the French people.

286
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:36.680
They have a BBC radio in anticipation of the allied invasion.
However,

287
00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:40.070
the script he was given did not acknowledge him as the legitimate interim ruler

288
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:42.590
of France and so he refused to deliver it.

289
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.040
In the wake of the d day invasion of June the sixth 1944 the free French army

290
00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.320
under the leadership of general delondra tasks,

291
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.850
gear lenses in southern France and were instrumental in pushing back the
Germans.

292
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.960
On June the 14th the goal returns to France traveling through newly liberated

293
00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:06.810
Norman towns.
He was well received by the townspeople.

294
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.210
He established the capital of the free France and bay,

295
00:17:09.211 --> 00:17:13.320
you and then set off to room where he met the newly installed Italian
government.

296
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.040
From there,
he flew to Washington for his first meeting with President Roosevelt.

297
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.240
The visit was a strange one with Roosevelt not providing the usual privileges of

298
00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:22.500
a visiting head of state.

299
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.180
The gold pushed for the allies to prioritize the liberation of Paris fearing a

300
00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:28.230
communist takeover,

301
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.010
but that was no strategic priority for the allies to focus on Paris.

302
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.780
Still through the goals insistence,

303
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.320
Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower agreed that Paris would be

304
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.200
prioritized out of humanitarian and symbolic need.

305
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.440
He also permitted the free French army to be the first to enter the French

306
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:44.640
capitol on Saturday,

307
00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:49.290
August the 26th the goal ends in Paris in a triumphant march down the shops you

308
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:52.370
say,
as the procession made its way towards Notradame cathedral,

309
00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:56.550
it came under machine gun fire from Vichy government militia I BBC reporter who

310
00:17:56.551 --> 00:17:59.350
was present noted the goals,
demeanor as a confident,

311
00:17:59.351 --> 00:18:01.290
destroyed forward stating general.

312
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:05.130
The goal walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hell of fire,

313
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.350
but he went straight ahead without hesitation.

314
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.790
His shoulders flung back and walk right down the center aisle even while the

315
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.320
bullets were pouring about him.

316
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.590
It was the most extraordinary example of courage I have ever seen.

317
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.070
Upon reaching the Great Hall of the Hotel De Ville.

318
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.760
De Gaulle spoke before an ecstatic crowd has inspiring message included these

319
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:27.720
words.
Paris,
Paris outraged Paris,
broken Paris martyred,

320
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:30.660
but Paris liberated,
liberated by itself,

321
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.830
liberated by its people with the assistance of the armies of France with a sport

322
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:38.100
and assistance of the whole of France.
The enemy is faltering,

323
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.670
but he has not yet beaten.
He was still on our soil.

324
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.320
It will not suffice that we,

325
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:46.110
with the assistance of our deer and admirable allies,

326
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:50.700
would have chased him from our home in order to be satisfied after what has

327
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:54.570
happened,
we wanted to enter his territory as is fitting has conquerors.

328
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.550
It is for this revenge,
this vengeance,

329
00:18:56.551 --> 00:19:01.290
and there's justice that we will continue to fight until the last day until the

330
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:06.290
day of total and complete victory with his bowls and triumphant entry into Paris

331
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:09.270
to gold won the respect of the world in the days that followed.

332
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.960
The allied leaders made statements recognizing his government is the legitimate

333
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:13.860
ruler of France.

334
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.070
The provisional government's of the French Republic was established on September

335
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:22.070
the 10th 1944 to gold then set out on a tour of the country and each city he

336
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.710
freely mixed with the crowds with no regard for his own safety.

337
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.490
Towards the ends of 1944 legal purge was established.

338
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:33.630
He punished traders during the occupation and remove the last vestiges of the

339
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.730
fishy governments.
Over the course of the purge,

340
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.460
around 2000 people were sentenced to death.

341
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:43.050
The goal commute it around a thousand of those sentences.
In May,

342
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.100
1945 the Germans surrendered signing an armistice with France in Berlin.
However,

343
00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:49.320
on the very day that victory in Europe was proclaimed,

344
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.160
may the eighth riots broke out in French juniors.
Yeah.
12 days later,

345
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:57.210
the French artillery fired on demonstrators and Damascus leaving hundreds debt.

346
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.840
This event events caused the advert testy relationship between gold and

347
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:05.841
Churchill to reach a low add trach or commented that the goal was a great danger

348
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:07.580
for peace and to Great Britain.

349
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.590
The French constituent assembly unanimously elected to goal is head of the

350
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:22.030
French government's on November the 13th 1945 after two months of struggles with

351
00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:26.200
communists within his government,
he abruptly resigned and forms the right wing,

352
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.670
a rally of the French people.

353
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.450
He believed that his popularity as a war hero would propel him back to power,

354
00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:35.260
but this gamble,
it didn't pay off.
After three years in the political wilderness,

355
00:20:35.261 --> 00:20:37.930
he left the party and politics behind

356
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.140
the golden retired from public life to write his memoirs.

357
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.740
In 1958 a crisis in Algeria.
It brought him back to politics,

358
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.710
the Algerian National Liberation Front.

359
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.500
It was waging a war for independence and the goal was seen as the kind of strong

360
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.330
national leader who could quash it.

361
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.620
He returned to the presidency and preceded to use brutal force to put down the

362
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:05.920
rentals.
Both these harsh methods,
they backfired.

363
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.790
The Algerian people were driven father towards independence while around the

364
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:10.181
welds.

365
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:13.870
There was condemnation against the French government under intense pressure from

366
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:17.650
within his own country and abroad to go finally grounds at independence to all

367
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:22.360
13 French African colonies in 1962 as the cold war develops,

368
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.420
the goal advocated the developments of a French nuclear arsenal.

369
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.310
The country became the world's fourth nuclear power in February of 1963 is later

370
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:32.860
to go refuse to sign the partial test ban treaty.

371
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.970
In 1965 he was reelected for a second.
70 a tem is French presidents.

372
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.140
He ran his government and just country with a heavy handed dogmatic style that

373
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.490
often drew criticism.

374
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.900
In early 1969 he called for a nationwide referendum on the reform of the Senate

375
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.230
when his proposal was rejected by the people he offered his resignation

376
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.740
following through on a televised promise make two days before the referendum

377
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.520
at the age of 78 having lived an extraordinarily full public life to go retire

378
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.520
to rise and updated version of his memoirs,

379
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.480
he died suddenly on November the ninth 1970 or watching TV.

380
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.810
He complained to his wife that he was feeling pain in his neck and then

381
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.540
collapsed to the ground.
He died within minutes.

382
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.690
The autopsy revealed that he had suffered from a ruptured blood vessel.

383
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.980
The funeral of Charles de Gaulle on November the 12th 1970 it was the largest

384
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.450
and French history.
Today,

385
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:30.100
he ranks alongside Napoleon as among the greatest of French leaders.

386
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.220
