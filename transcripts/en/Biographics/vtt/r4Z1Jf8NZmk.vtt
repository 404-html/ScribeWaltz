6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.880
While you may have seen his name on the cover of a comic book or in the movie

7
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:21.360
credits,

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.620
few people know the story of how Frank Miller went from being a comic book fan

9
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:27.690
growing up in a small town in Vermont.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.230
Just someone who has gained international fame and fortune and in the

11
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.170
biographics video today.
Well,
we're going to tell you all about him.

12
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.880
<v 0>Frank Miller was born in Olney,</v>

14
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.881
Maryland on January the 27th 1957 into a large Irish Catholic family.

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.670
His mother was a nurse and just father ran his own business as an electrician

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.250
and carpenter,
Frank's family moved to Montpellier,

17
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.940
Vermont where he grew up with his six siblings when he was six years old.

18
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:06.600
Frank Miller bought his first a Batman Comic Book and after reading the comics

19
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.810
so much so they began drawing Batman on pieces of scrap paper.

20
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.410
He took some of his parents' typewriter papers so the d could fold and staple

21
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.450
the pages together into a small comic book.

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.470
He then drew his first comic and presented it to his mother saying that this was

23
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:21.600
what he was going to do when he grew up,

24
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.230
his father became a traveling salesman and he would drive back and forth between

25
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.520
Vermont and New York City.

26
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.790
Frankie would go with him on these road trips just so he could look through the

27
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.840
big comic book stores in New York and by all of the different titles that he

28
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.840
could engage in a small town if a month for the rest of his young life.

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
He would read comics and practice drawing in the hopes that he could make his

30
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.120
dreams come true.

31
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
Growing up his favorite movies to watch where film noir movies like a touch of

32
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.360
evil and Chinatown.
These stories,

33
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:52.480
they always had a lot of action with corrupt detectives and beautiful famine for

34
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.220
towels.

35
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.970
He especially loved the movies that were in black and white because of the drama

36
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:57.620
that fell,
make,

37
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.770
were able to achieve with all of the dark shadows on the screen over the years.

38
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.600
He read every comic he could get his hands on.

39
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.880
It wasn't just enjoying the stories as a fan.

40
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.530
He was analyzing both the writing and as the artwork absorbing every little

41
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.860
detail he would read.
Every new character published by marvel comics,

42
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.650
including one called of a cat claws of the cats,

43
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.970
which premiered in November of 1972 when he was 16 years old.

44
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.660
He wrote a fan letter to marvel comics.
Soon after reading this new comic,

45
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.030
this letter was published in issue number three.

46
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.080
In the letter he wrote wonderful at last,
a woman character with character.

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.660
I for 1:00 AM sick of the helpless female types,

48
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:35.850
which of cluttered up comics for so long.

49
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.890
This woman that Frank Miller was talking about,

50
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.470
which ends up being renamed tiger and what many people have not heard of the

51
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:42.410
superhero today.

52
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.650
She would be an inspiration for how he portrayed his female characters in the

53
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.260
future.
Even though they'd only responded to his fan lesser.

54
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.930
It was still exhilarating to see his name in print still.

55
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:55.560
He always knew he wanted to draw comics for the rest of his life and he felt

56
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.410
ready to leave his parents home.
On one of these long road trips with father,

57
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.950
he packed a few extra bags with the intention of moving to New York City when he

58
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.720
was only 17 all his life.

59
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.350
Frank Miller dreams of permanently getting out of the countryside and he was

60
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.340
exhilarated to be surrounded by the city that he was so in love with.

61
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.950
One of the first things that he did was visit the empire state building.

62
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.671
At the time,

63
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:18.640
there were no screens up to prevent people from pulling over the ledge if they

64
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:20.320
went to the very top.
Therefore,

65
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.040
Miller was able to sit up on the ledge with a sketch book and he was drawing the

66
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:24.820
skyline.

67
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.360
He kept on sitting on rooftops to get a sense of the city from those angles.

68
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.120
These drawings would eventually ends up in his later comics.

69
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.260
Miller lived in a tiny studio apartments and he was able to use the carpentry

70
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:35.651
skills.

71
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.010
It learns by working at his father's business to find gigs that would help him

72
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:39.844
pay his rent.

73
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.410
The apartment was very small and old and there were cockroaches and water bugs

74
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.670
crawling all over the place.

75
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.620
He was motivated to work for a better life and to try and start his career.

76
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.191
Therefore,

77
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:54.940
he started making appointments since taking his drawing portfolio to various

78
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.900
comic book publishers around New York.
He matched with Joe Orlando at DC comics.

79
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.010
You've told Miller this,

80
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.070
he was not good enough to work for them and he might have a B.

81
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.450
His portfolio was held together with strings and bugs that crawl inside it at

82
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.010
some point.
As we were talking,

83
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.430
one of these past screwed out of my portfolio into my lap and so I could do

84
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.330
nothing but compromise or friends during the interview as it squirmed and

85
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.080
desperately fought for its life.
It was not the brightest day of my life.

86
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.120
Needless to say,
he did not get to that job.
That level of constant humiliation.

87
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.800
It would have been enough for some people to pack that bags and move back home

88
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
and for awhile it fruity did seem as if Mila's dream would never become a

89
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:34.984
reality,

90
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.280
but he never gave up with every rejection he kept trying to improve and see.

91
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.200
Went to more and more interviews.

92
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.620
Frank Miller's favorite artist by far was Neal Adams,

93
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.650
who's Batman and green lands and comics that made him a big superstar.
Hey,

94
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:49.960
the background's in advertising,

95
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.130
so his pictures at an elements of photo realism with accurate and [inaudible].

96
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.300
He was looking for more of Adams as work and trying to aspire to be like him.

97
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.250
When you went on an interview at marvel comics,

98
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:03.190
he actually got to meet and Neil Adams and he blessed him,

99
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.930
know how much he admired his work.

100
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.280
Adam's credits his daughter with his decision to give her a chance.
He stated,

101
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.010
obviously she felt sorry for him because he was a skinny kid who looks like a to

102
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:18.160
crane.
He went on to say that middle of the portfolio was awful.

103
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.090
It was so bad.
My heart sunk and I was like,
oh my God.

104
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.540
One of these guys,
even though he harshly criticized his work,

105
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.500
so he graciously calls up one of his friends to help Frank Mir.

106
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.390
I get a job as a storyboard artist,
as an advertising firm.

107
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.840
The artwork that was required for these kind of jobs did not need to be as

108
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.660
realistic as a marvel comic.
Birkins this way,

109
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.920
Miller was able to get professional experience and get tips from coworkers on a

110
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.560
daily basis.
Now,
the Frank Miller was a working artist.

111
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.860
He no longer had to struggle to find carpentry work to pay the bills.

112
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.000
He was drawing for a living and he was getting better during the process,

113
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.420
but he still wants it to do comics.
Every time.

114
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.270
Miller thought that maybe it improved aunt and off he would go to Neil Adams and

115
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.590
apply to work at marvel again.

116
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.910
It took a very long time to truly understand how to improve.

117
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.140
Adams would take middle drawings and place a piece of tracing paper over the top

118
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:10.820
so that he could draw his own version,

119
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.490
showing how to properly redraw the same image.

120
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.480
He then pushed the copy paper towards Miller as if to say,
try again.

121
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.340
Often watching Neil Adams so many times he began to study anatomy textbooks to

122
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.540
get a good feeling for drawing the human body.

123
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.500
You realize that his biggest problem was creating accurate proportions and

124
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.530
understanding how muscles and bones move together.

125
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.850
It would practice these tips that Adams gave him and came back again and again.

126
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.571
Finally,

127
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:38.900
one day Neal Adams looked at the drawings and picks up the phone and call one of

128
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:43.070
his connections and to get him a job with gold key comics.
Adam said,

129
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.520
whatever you do,
don't say that.
I'm responsible for Frank Miller.

130
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.210
I've done the same thing for a hundred guys and nobody responded the way.

131
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.230
Frank did.
Nobody advanced that quickly and I made it hard for him.

132
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.930
If you're already gone through it,
you'd have gone home crying.

133
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.020
They were publishing the comic book version of the twilight zone.

134
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.860
There were very few copies made because it wasn't an incredibly popular comic,

135
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:04.760
but Frank Miller,

136
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.630
we're still over the moon because this was his chance to get his foot in the

137
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:09.650
door of the industry.

138
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.860
He was so nervous about doing a good job with his first paid gig.

139
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.920
Did it took him three weeks to complete just three pages,

140
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.470
but this was just the beginning of his career as a comic book artist.
After this,

141
00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:23.870
he started getting small gigs at both DC and marvel and to truly begun his

142
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.370
journey to success.

143
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.290
As time went on,

144
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.800
Frank Miller had enough professional experience under his belt to be hired as a

145
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:40.340
full time artist and writer marvel comics for the series daredevil Stanley and

146
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:42.610
artist and Bill Everett who'd created daredevil.

147
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:46.690
But Frank Miller is responsible for the dark and gritty hard edge that defined

148
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:50.620
the character.
He was able to explore New York's hell's kitchen firsthand,

149
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.650
accurately capture the essence of this area.

150
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.510
Since Miller was raised Irish Catholic,

151
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:59.280
he was also able to bring a lot of the internal struggles felts by daredevil

152
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.060
secret identity.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.170
who's religious beliefs stopped him from killing bad guys.
At that time.

154
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.560
Frank Miller had no aspirations to make original characters.

155
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.280
He was just thrilled to finally have a steady job working in the comic book

156
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:17.170
industry,
but it was clear that he had a unique artistic style and point of view.

157
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.950
He was constantly researching by reading comics from all over the world as he

158
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:24.250
thought a lot about how he could draw a seems to make the reader slow down and

159
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.840
really take their time on each page by giving them a visually interesting world.

160
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.620
He eventually created the character,
a lecturer during an interview.

161
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.140
He explains his motivations for creating the character,

162
00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:37.720
stating daredevil had a lot of girlfriends,

163
00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:40.270
but what about one who can kick his butt?

164
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.800
She became the first female character who was like the femme fatale of the old

165
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:46.930
film noir movies that he loved so much.

166
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.230
She was beautiful and she couldn't be trusted.
She was an assassin,

167
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:53.590
but I love Matthew mode or created a feeling of guilt.

168
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.890
Sorry to spoil it for those of who don't know,

169
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.620
but we do need to mention that Frank Miller made the decision.

170
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.050
This electra had to die for her crimes,

171
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.130
which he did at the hands of the villain bullseye.
Nothing like this.

172
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:07.140
Had ever been done in comics before,

173
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.720
especially with such a popular character before this,

174
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.620
most characters continued to live on forever,
even if they were villains.

175
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.910
It was dark and he showed that he was gearing the series towards adult readers.

176
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.660
This also really showed that frank had more about the storytelling.

177
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.240
Then he did the popularity Tangier fans.

178
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:28.350
They were upset by the death of a lecturer,
but Frank Miller put the story first.

179
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:30.540
Without worrying too much about the public opinion,

180
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.500
he was writing the story in a way that makes sense for the life and growth of

181
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.220
the characters.

182
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.790
He knew that Matt Murdock would never be able to settle down and have a happily

183
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:40.290
ever after life with a lecturer,

184
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.900
but they were too in love to ever leave each other,

185
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.490
so the only way for him to move on and be with someone else would be if a

186
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:48.324
lecturer died.

187
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.140
In 1983 he left marvel comics to work for DC.
He published a series called Ronin,

188
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:00.700
which was about a Samurai warrior.

189
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.590
Frank Miller had been inspired by French comics and Japanese and Nangeroni

190
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.960
borrowed from the styles that he discovered from both of these countries.

191
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.850
Specifically he credits lone wolf and cub by Kazuo we cars being his biggest

192
00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:16.840
influence as well as the work of John Gorod who goes by the pen name Mobius.

193
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.050
Frank Miller began working together with an artist DC comics named Lynn Varley.

194
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.780
[inaudible] colored the drawings of Ronan.
They worked incredibly well together,

195
00:10:25.781 --> 00:10:28.120
bouncing ideas off one another constantly.

196
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.910
She continued to do the inking on all of his future work.

197
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.970
They also fell in love and eventually he got married.
Sadly,

198
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.800
they divorced in 2005 d c loved his work so much so that they asked him to write

199
00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:40.720
and draw a new Batman series.

200
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.400
At first he actually said no because he respected Batman as a character too much

201
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.000
after all.

202
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.690
It was the very first comic that had ever read since he knew that the character

203
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.380
meant just as much to millions of people around the world as it meant to him,

204
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.740
even though he was working full time in the comic book industry.

205
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.770
Those feelings of self doubt.
They were still there.

206
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.060
He was afraid that he wasn't good enough and that he might ruin Batman.
However,

207
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.180
he did keep the thought in the back of his mind.
For years,

208
00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:09.220
the character of Batman had never aged.

209
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.720
He was permanently 29 years old and Robin was always his teenage sidekick.

210
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.470
He thought to himself,
I'll be damned if I'm older than Batman,

211
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.280
and it was at this point that he had a light bulb moments he imagined Batman in

212
00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:24.490
his fifties he's older,
disillusions and Grizzles,

213
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.190
and for a man who's been dressing as a bat for so many years,

214
00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:29.560
he's certainly going to have some psychological issues.

215
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.670
His story of Batman is far darker than any other version that did it ever come

216
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.340
before it.
And this comic was of course Batman,
the dark knight returns.

217
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.620
This became a huge success and did a specialty,

218
00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:44.560
resonated with fans who had grown up with the character.

219
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.760
The movie adaptation of the dark night in 2008 became one of the most successful

220
00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:53.761
superhero stories of all time and it's arguably the best board trial of that has

221
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:56.410
ever been made.
During an interview at the Cuban School of media,

222
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.590
Frank Miller was asked if he preferred daredevil or Batman.

223
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.670
He very quickly said Batman will always be number one in his heart because his

224
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:05.350
motivations behind his character,

225
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.940
a beautifully simple by man is trying to restore order to a world where there is

226
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:13.510
none.
While the joker is trying to create chaos because of that,

227
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.970
the story will stand the test of time

228
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.810
off to seeing success in the comic book industry,
Frank Mila,

229
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:28.320
to sign it that he wants it to move to a warmer climate.
So he left New York.

230
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.890
I moved to Los Angeles.
They had no intention of getting into the movie business,

231
00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:35.490
but one day he got a phone call from a movie producer who wanted to work with

232
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:38.910
him on robocop two and three since he loved the first movie,

233
00:12:38.911 --> 00:12:41.040
he agreed to work on the projects.
However,

234
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:45.000
the director was constantly changing Frank Miller's script during robocop two he

235
00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:48.630
was on set every day one thing to be involved.
What about by robocop three?

236
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:50.520
He got so angry at the movie making process.

237
00:12:50.521 --> 00:12:54.480
He decided to leave and never come back during an interview.
He said,

238
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.180
don't be the writer.
The director has got power,

239
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.560
the screenplay as a fire hydrants with a row of dogs waiting around the block

240
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:02.100
for it.

241
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.090
Miller played small cameo roles in Robocop two and three and z dies in both

242
00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:08.330
films.
After getting these small screen credits,

243
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:10.590
he made cameos and some other movies too.

244
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.670
In 1994 both the Frank Miller and Stanley played themselves in a movie called

245
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.910
Juggler,
Weiner,
Vampire Odyssey.
There is even a scene.

246
00:13:17.911 --> 00:13:19.800
West Stanley gets to kill Frank Miller,

247
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.560
so while they got to enjoy having fun and it can be horror film,

248
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.100
he's still begins to feel jaded and he didn't feel the same passion for his

249
00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:28.350
career that he had back in New York.

250
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.420
He really wasn't doing what he actually loved.

251
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.180
He began to feel a lot of anx towards Los Angeles.

252
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.040
This is what inspired him to write sin city.

253
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:39.270
In 1991 he was inspired to make the story by a black and white comic called

254
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.620
Johnny Hazard by Frank Robbins and all of the film and Wa had watched as a kid.

255
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.570
He sold the idea to dark horse comics.

256
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.260
He decided to not hold back and just pour everything that he wanted into the

257
00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.630
comic.
He's Eddie wanted it to have a tough guys,

258
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.910
beautiful women and vintage cars.

259
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.540
Since city was released in a series of graphic novels that are standalone

260
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:00.000
stories,
but they all exist in the same universe.

261
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.690
He continue to work on Sin City over the next few years because it was what he

262
00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:08.250
truly enjoyed doing and he was totally satisfied with it being his one and only

263
00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:12.420
project.
In 2003 a dead of all movie was released starring Ben Affleck.

264
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.200
Since the character rights belong to marvel,

265
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.530
frank mellow didn't have any creative input on the film.

266
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.340
Many fans felt that this movie did not capture the true essence of the dad of or

267
00:14:20.341 --> 00:14:24.090
comics and they wouldn't get what they were looking for until Netflix created

268
00:14:24.091 --> 00:14:28.170
the original series in 2015 starring Charlie Cox.
However,

269
00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:31.890
in an interview in 2017 Miller said that he have not even bothered to watch the

270
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:35.790
Netflix series so he doesn't give any comments about what he personally thinks

271
00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.890
about those adaptations.
Ironically,

272
00:14:37.891 --> 00:14:40.600
even though he created the sin city comic after avenging,

273
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.890
his frustrations with Hollywood's and z really did not enjoy watching

274
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:45.270
adaptations of his work.

275
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:49.110
All of that would circle back in 2009 to five when he got the opportunity to

276
00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:52.820
write and direct the sins that he with Robert Rodriguez.

277
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.760
At first Mila said no to the project because it sin city.

278
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.390
It was like his baby and he had seen what Hollywood had done to his work in the

279
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:00.860
past.
But Rodriguez,

280
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.060
he was a fan and he understood how important it was to portray the stories

281
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.870
accurately.

282
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.680
Rodriguez also gave Frank Mir like complete creative control so that he could

283
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:13.010
recreate his comics panel by panel and frame by frame.

284
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.960
They will act on showing the screen tests,

285
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:19.340
do several different actors and they were surprised and impressed by the work he

286
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:21.970
was able to attract a star studded Carstens.

287
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.210
Even Quentin Tarantino helps to direct the fight scenes in the movie during an

288
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:27.530
interview about Sin City,

289
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:31.340
he said that he was shocked at how much he enjoyed working together with the

290
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:32.390
actors.
He said,

291
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.500
I expected the worst and they got the best in the behind the scenes clips.

292
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:38.060
They're feeling seems to be mutual.

293
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.630
All of the actors were really happy that they could ask Frank Miller questions

294
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:45.230
is about the character's motivations as well as getting more depth about the

295
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:46.670
overall story.
Since then,

296
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.570
more or Frank Miller stories have been adapted to both the small and big
screens.

297
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.170
He continues to publish a new comics on a regular basis at 62 years old.

298
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:58.320
He is far from retiring anytime soon.
In 2018 Netflix audit,

299
00:15:58.321 --> 00:16:02.780
a series called cast,
which is a dark reimagining of the King Arthur legend,

300
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.850
even though he's still making new material,

301
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.320
he has already reached legendary status and a lot of ways is images to find a

302
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.490
generation today.

303
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:14.630
His work has been on display in a number of art museums including the Norman

304
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.580
Rockwell museum and even the loof in Paris.

305
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.510
The work of the young man who was told that he wasn't good enough is now next to

306
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:23.180
some of the greatest artists in the world.

307
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.540
The Cherry on top of all of this success is that Frank Miller has made quite a

308
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:30.800
lot of money too.
He has an estimated net worth of $45 million.

309
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.540
He owns his fortune doing what he loved and doing it extremely well.
