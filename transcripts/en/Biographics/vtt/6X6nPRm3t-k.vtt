00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>There have been many brilliant minds who have lent their talents,</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>the committing and the solving of crime,</v>

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:10.341
<v Speaker 1>but none stands as supremely as that of Sherlock Holmes with is unequaled.</v>

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Powers of reasoning deduction and scientific application homes was able to solve</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the cases that are baffled the best of Scotland Yard with his tweed suit cloth</v>

6
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>cap and his black clay pipe.</v>

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>The world's greatest sleuth has become familiar to a new generation through</v>

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>television and movie adaptations of his many adventures in this week's by</v>

9
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>graphics.</v>

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>We have dug deep to uncover the private world of the notoriously secretive Mr</v>

11
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock Holmes may well have been the greatest detective living or dead is to</v>

12
00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>investigate the criminal minds,</v>

13
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>but he was an extremely private genius as a result of the study of his early</v>

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>years as an exercise in frustration for biographies.</v>

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.000
<v Speaker 1>On one of the few occasions that he did open up about his family origins.</v>

16
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>He mentioned to his ever loyal sidekick,</v>

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.113
<v Speaker 1>James Watson,</v>

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>that his ancestors were country squires who up here to have that much the same</v>

19
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>life as it's natural to people of that class.</v>

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>He also revealed that his grandmother was the sister of Mlg,</v>

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Horace Vernay,</v>

22
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>the renowned French artist who specialized in the military paintings.</v>

23
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>His final familiar revelation was that he had an older brother,</v>

24
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Mycroft,</v>

25
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>who according to show lock in self possessed even greater powers of deduction</v>

26
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.233
<v Speaker 1>than he did.</v>

27
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Apart from those few tidbits,</v>

28
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>we are left to work out the details of homes,</v>

29
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>his early life from circumstantial evidence and deduction.</v>

30
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Something of a coincidence I might think.</v>

31
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Holmes was born and raised in the county of Sussex on the south coast of</v>

32
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

33
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>The homeless family seat was that Linford,</v>

34
00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>a few miles from portion sherlock's.</v>

35
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Father,</v>

36
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>a gentleman named roderick homes was born around 18,</v>

37
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

38
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Roderick was a man's man who delighted in such outdoor pursuits as fox hunting,</v>

39
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 1>trout fishing and pheasant shooting in sharp contrast to his two sons.</v>

40
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He didn't put much credence in book learning and affairs of the minds.</v>

41
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Shallock's mother was 13 years younger than her husband's Charlotte.</v>

42
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Aircraft came from Lancashire,</v>

43
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>but origins were French from her mother's to see all their names.</v>

44
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>She inherited not only artistic leanings,</v>

45
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 1>but a flighty self-absorbed personality.</v>

46
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.451
<v Speaker 1>The marriage,</v>

47
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>it was not a happy one,</v>

48
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>and with such disparate personalities,</v>

49
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it could be said that it was doomed from the start.</v>

50
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Their first child was born in 18,</v>

51
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 1>46 and given the name of John Microsoft homes,</v>

52
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>the name gives us an insight into the state of the parent's mental processes.</v>

53
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Roderick hated his own name and wanted to give his firstborn son a plane on</v>

54
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.340
<v Speaker 1>complicated name,</v>

55
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 1>but Charlotte has quite the opposite view.</v>

56
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to name that was different,</v>

57
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>striking and memorable.</v>

58
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

59
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Roderick one,</v>

60
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte managed to squeeze her choice and Amalgam of possessive nature,</v>

61
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>my with the last syllable of her maiden name cropped in as a middle name.</v>

62
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It was only because he spends more of his formative years around his possessive</v>

63
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>mother that the boy came to be known as Mycroft a name which grated on his</v>

64
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

65
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Every time he heard it,</v>

66
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>it took Roderick and Charlotte seven years to produce another child's no</v>

67
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>surprise considering the deteriorating state of their union.</v>

68
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.611
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

69
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>roderick has given up entirely on trying to control his wife's autistic or as he</v>

70
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>sort irrational site.</v>

71
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>He left anything up to her and she even out did a creativity the first time</v>

72
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

73
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>she named a second son,</v>

74
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock.</v>

75
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>The name wasn't entirely her own invention in order to escape from the</v>

76
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>increasing abuse of our husbands who had taken more and more to the bottle,</v>

77
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>she began making trips to London where she would visit art galleries and theater</v>

78
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.143
<v Speaker 1>performances.</v>

79
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>She became enamored with a father and son,</v>

80
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>pair of English artists,</v>

81
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>both who were named William Sherlock in the hopes that our seconds would prove</v>

82
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>to be a great artist.</v>

83
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>She gave him the Monica Sherlock</v>

84
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>was the customer of the day to send sons away to boarding school.</v>

85
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Roderick didn't believe in higher education,</v>

86
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>and so the two brothers endured a succession of tutors,</v>

87
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>some of whom were good,</v>

88
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>while others were terrible,</v>

89
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>even when they did have a good teacher.</v>

90
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

91
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>volatile environments cost by the parents losing for one another did not make</v>

92
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>for conductive learning.</v>

93
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

94
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft and sherlock educated themselves,</v>

95
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>despite their environments,</v>

96
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it seemed became apparent that both boys were brilliant.</v>

97
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock instantly fell in love with books later referring to himself as an</v>

98
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>omnivorous reader.</v>

99
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 1>His brother,</v>

100
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile,</v>

101
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>was obsessed with numbers even though there was a seven year gap in age,</v>

102
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>the two boys were extraordinarily close.</v>

103
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>They drew up on each other for mutual support and mental stimulation,</v>

104
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.761
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft periods,</v>

105
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>or an overweight child.</v>

106
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>You avoided any type of exercise or physical exertion.</v>

107
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Instead in his early teens,</v>

108
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>he became fascinated with electricity and chemistry.</v>

109
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>This soon caught the attention of his younger brother.</v>

110
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>He began saving as pocket money to buy scientific Kratos shut look,</v>

111
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>escapes the unpleasant environments at home.</v>

112
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>By finding interests outside the house,</v>

113
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>he developed a friendship with a man who was in charge of his father's hunting</v>

114
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

115
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>This man named Sherman was a taxidermist and shell expense many hours watching</v>

116
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.170
<v Speaker 1>him at work.</v>

117
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>The boy also spends a lot of time in his father's stables.</v>

118
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Rate.</v>

119
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Develops a great acquiring knowledge.</v>

120
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.483
<v Speaker 1>Unlike his brother,</v>

121
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock,</v>

122
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed sports.</v>

123
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>He became a talented young boxer winning a number of matches against local boys.</v>

124
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.761
<v Speaker 1>Roderick,</v>

125
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.020
<v Speaker 1>during his sober periods,</v>

126
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>tried his best,</v>

127
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 1>send the boys into country.</v>

128
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Squire's,</v>

129
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>though they both became possible shots with fouling pieces.</v>

130
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Neither of them had any stomach for fox hunting.</v>

131
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

132
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Mycroft was a poor horse rider.</v>

133
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>One Constellation for Roderick though was that they both took to fishing.</v>

134
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>What they really relished was the consultative nature of the activity,</v>

135
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>which provided plenty of time for planning overall.</v>

136
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

137
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Roderick was disappointed in how his sons were turning out,</v>

138
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>unsurprisingly then he very rarely showed them any affection,</v>

139
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>preferring to cast aspirations on their manhood and their physical prowess.</v>

140
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>This lack of physical display was more than compensated for by Charlotte who</v>

141
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:57.310
<v Speaker 1>would shower the boys with hugs and kisses at every opportunity.</v>

142
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>This only served to further strengthen roderick's conviction that he had raised</v>

143
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>a couple of cities when our sons were old enough.</v>

144
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte took them to London where she introduced them to concerts and opera</v>

145
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>and guided them through the picture galleries of the metropolis.</v>

146
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>The brothers found out chatter,</v>

147
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>tiresome and their behavior sometimes embarrassing,</v>

148
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but they were grateful to get away from their father.</v>

149
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>As a result of these London visits,</v>

150
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>shallow developed a strong love of music.</v>

151
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>This inspired Charlotte to hire a violin teacher for the boy,</v>

152
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>but the lessons they didn't last long.</v>

153
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>When Roderick found out about it,</v>

154
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>he put an immediate stop to the lessons Mycroft and Charlotte Gossett and spends</v>

155
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time with other boys in the community.</v>

156
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>They found them not to be up to their intellectual level,</v>

157
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>and so I've spent most of their time together.</v>

158
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

159
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 1>they did make one great friends and that would be Charles Edward Howard.</v>

160
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Vincent Charles was the son of Sir Frederick Vincent Rector of the parish of</v>

161
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>slim fit.</v>

162
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>This boy was just as brilliant as the homes boys.</v>

163
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>He was sent off to boarding school at age 12 that spends most of his time during</v>

164
00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:00.140
<v Speaker 1>the school vacations in the company of Mycroft and Sherlock Charles Howard.</v>

165
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Vincent winds onto four j distinguished multifaceted Korea,</v>

166
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>which fills two pages in Britain's dictionary of national biography.</v>

167
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Roderick refused to send his oldest son to university when Microsoft reached the</v>

168
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.014
<v Speaker 1>age of 20,</v>

169
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>but by now the older brother had enough of his father's abusive ways and team</v>

170
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>moved to London where he secured a position as an assistant to a member of</v>

171
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:19.784
<v Speaker 1>parliaments.</v>

172
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>When his brother moved away.</v>

173
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock was 13 years of age.</v>

174
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>He spent an unhappy few years as a loner in an unhappy household,</v>

175
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>is only bright spots being the regular letters that he received from his brother</v>

176
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>in London and surprisingly at age 18,</v>

177
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Sharla convinced his father to send them to Cambridge University.</v>

178
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>During his first semester,</v>

179
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.350
<v Speaker 1>he was invited by a fellow students by the name of Victor Trevor to spends the</v>

180
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 1>vacation with him that his family's estate and Norfolk not jeans.</v>

181
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You returned to his fueling parents.</v>

182
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>He gladly accepted the invitation following this visit.</v>

183
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock did not return home for future holidays,</v>

184
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>but took rooms in London where he buried himself in chemical research.</v>

185
00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>He had his mind set on becoming a chemical analyst while the university homes</v>

186
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 1>played no part in team sports which would have required cooperation with others.</v>

187
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

188
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 1>he focused on boxing.</v>

189
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 1>The only friends he had at college was Victor,</v>

190
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 1>trevor,</v>

191
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>just as the only friends he had as an adult was Dr Watson</v>

192
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.210
<v Speaker 1>in the autumn of 18,</v>

193
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>74 shallow to be on his third year of study at Cambridge,</v>

194
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>but he left before the year was out.</v>

195
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.603
<v Speaker 1>With no degree.</v>

196
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>The details have never been revealed,</v>

197
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>but it is clear that some sort of trauma afflicted,</v>

198
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>both sherlock and Mycroft during these months and left psychological wounds on</v>

199
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

200
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Biographers have speculated that the situation may have involved members of the</v>

201
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>opposite sex.</v>

202
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Dr Watson later shed some light on the homes mindset.</v>

203
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 1>His aversion to women and is disinclination to form new friendships were very</v>

204
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>typical of his unemotional character,</v>

205
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own</v>

206
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

207
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Homes himself once said,</v>

208
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I am not a whole sold admirer of womankind.</v>

209
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Women are never to be entirely trusted,</v>

210
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>not the best of them.</v>

211
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Despite this homes was always courteous and considerate to women,</v>

212
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>is hostility to the other.</v>

213
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Sex was confined to the areas of love and marriage,</v>

214
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>so whatever the precise nature of this emotional blow,</v>

215
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>it resulted in sherlock being a lifelong user of narcotics.</v>

216
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>This addiction was in sharp contrast to his temperance and otherwise clean mode</v>

217
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>of living at the time the use of narcotics in Britain was neagle still have.</v>

218
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>It was alarming to Dr Watson.</v>

219
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>He wanted more than one occasion,</v>

220
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>tried to reason with the great detective,</v>

221
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but it was a mind of destroying completely wasteful and individual practice.</v>

222
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Homes usually brushed him off about it over the years,</v>

223
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 1>but with Watson's help,</v>

224
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>he was able to have limited success in shaking off the habits whether the tragic</v>

225
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 1>events was separate to the death of homes.</v>

226
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>As parents is not clear,</v>

227
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>those passings surely would have been horrific in themselves.</v>

228
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>They have in the autumn of 18,</v>

229
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 1>74 when Microsoft was in London and Shallow Cambridge.</v>

230
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.283
<v Speaker 1>On hearing the news,</v>

231
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>both boys returned immediately to Sussex.</v>

232
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 1>That father had been killed by a pistol,</v>

233
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 1>shot to the head of their mother,</v>

234
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 1>had been strangled.</v>

235
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>The police immediately ruled out murder suicide,</v>

236
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>but Microsoft in sherlock knew better.</v>

237
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>A lonely and depressed Charlotte,</v>

238
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>but found release in the arms of another man.</v>

239
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm discovering the affair.</v>

240
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.781
<v Speaker 1>Roger.</v>

241
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 1>He had strangled his wife in a frenzy and then stagger to the stables where you</v>

242
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>attend the pistol on himself.</v>

243
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:15.931
<v Speaker 1>The two sons.</v>

244
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Did you still have this room,</v>

245
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 1>a capital examination of the scene coupled with that inside knowledge of the</v>

246
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:22.380
<v Speaker 1>state of their parents' marriage,</v>

247
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.800
<v Speaker 1>the man who had been the subject of Charlotte's affection,</v>

248
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the indirect cause of the tragedy was a man of privilege by the</v>

249
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 1>name of Lord Tap Clinton.</v>

250
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>He discretes the left the area after the deaths,</v>

251
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>but his actions left a deep seated resentments of titles,</v>

252
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>men in the heart of Sherlock,</v>

253
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 1>this family tragedy,</v>

254
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>his homes at the age of 20.</v>

255
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I left him with a deep seated business against his mother,</v>

256
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>apart from his brother.</v>

257
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 1>She was the only person who had ever shown him love and affection and from all</v>

258
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>

259
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 1>what he decided he needed was a complete change of scenery</v>

260
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>from earliest boyhood.</v>

261
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 1>SHELLAC had been fascinated with the American west.</v>

262
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to travel to America and payers way for some time,</v>

263
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>so mycroft advanced him some money from his father's estate.</v>

264
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 1>He left for the new world in early 18,</v>

265
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>75.</v>

266
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>When he arrived in New York.</v>

267
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>He became fascinated by the theater scene in Manhattan.</v>

268
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It provided the escape that he needed.</v>

269
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:15.811
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

270
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>he loved the scene so much that he drifted into a theatrical troupe in the</v>

271
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:22.230
<v Speaker 1>autumn of [inaudible] 75 because Victorian society in America,</v>

272
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:23.110
<v Speaker 1>as well as in England,</v>

273
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>considered acting less than reputable occupation homes,</v>

274
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 1>chose not to tarnish his family,</v>

275
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>named by calling himself Mr Sherlock.</v>

276
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 1>After a brief running in Manhattan,</v>

277
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>the three went on tour that took them as far as Chicago.</v>

278
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Those Korea on the American stage lasted for less than a year.</v>

279
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Homes found the work absorbing and soon became adept at the professional skills</v>

280
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>of makeup and disguise.</v>

281
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Disability benefited him greatly and later cases where he recreated himself into</v>

282
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>everything from an Italian priest to an old woman</v>

283
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>to obtain realistic details for the working class and criminal roles.</v>

284
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>He played on stage homes ventured into dangerous neighborhoods in New York and</v>

285
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:02.711
<v Speaker 1>other cities.</v>

286
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>That is true visitors.</v>

287
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>There's often proved hazardous,</v>

288
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 1>requiring the cooperation of the local police.</v>

289
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>These excursions also gave homes,</v>

290
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:10.331
<v Speaker 1>contacts,</v>

291
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and information that he was able to draw on during his later professional</v>

292
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

293
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>As he followed police investigations in the cities he was touring.</v>

294
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>He began to realize the practical value of the scientific knowledge.</v>

295
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>You had gains from his boyhood experiments and his cambridge education,</v>

296
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 1>bloodstains poisons mud caked on shoes,</v>

297
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 1>liquid left in glasses,</v>

298
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>his scientific way of looking at such as revealed forensic evidence,</v>

299
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 1>which he was able to pass on to the police for the first time.</v>

300
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>He began to seriously consider taking up detective work professionally.</v>

301
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.230
<v Speaker 1>He imagined himself something entirely new to the Victorian era,</v>

302
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>a scientific detective.</v>

303
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 1>This motive was to power him through the rest of his life.</v>

304
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>After 18 months of traveling around,</v>

305
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>the United States almost decided it was time to return to the country of his</v>

306
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>birth on resends in London.</v>

307
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.900
<v Speaker 1>He founds lodging just around the corner from the British Museum.</v>

308
00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 1>He began running errands for private detectives carrying out such distasteful</v>

309
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 1>duties as gathering evidence for divorce cases,</v>

310
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 1>but all the while he was picking up the basics of detective work to further this</v>

311
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

312
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>He revived his study of science with a focus on chemistry,</v>

313
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 1>botany,</v>

314
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.490
<v Speaker 1>and anatomy</v>

315
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.820
<v Speaker 1>offer a year also,</v>

316
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Hamza was ready to branch off and start his own detective agency.</v>

317
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>His first cases were domestic and routine revolving around minus civil disputes.</v>

318
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 1>He walked onto cultivate his relationship with the police,</v>

319
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 1>passing on information that would help them crack a case in return.</v>

320
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>The police past clients onto him the year 18,</v>

321
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 1>88 was a fortunate one for Sherlock Holmes.</v>

322
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Scans will have left the London police in a situation that then they were open</v>

323
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 1>to the up and coming to tax if the case which has become known as the musgrave</v>

324
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:48.900
<v Speaker 1>ritual was his first high profile case establishing his superior powers of</v>

325
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>deduction ends for us to investigation to a fascinated public case.</v>

326
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Got underway when Holmes was cooled by a university,</v>

327
00:13:55.931 --> 00:14:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Acquaintance Reginald Musgrave to have musgraves domestic staff had disappeared</v>

328
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.340
<v Speaker 1>following their dismissal for reading a secret family documents,</v>

329
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>calls of the musgrave ritual items not only solve the case,</v>

330
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 1>but uncovered the crown of Kenny Charles the fest which had been missing for 200</v>

331
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>years as a result of the fame garnered from the musgrave ritual homes was</v>

332
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>invited to give a series of lectures to instruct the newly formed criminal</v>

333
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.590
<v Speaker 1>investigation department.</v>

334
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Won't cid the brilliance.</v>

335
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four year old now found himself in lightening hard bitten Korea cops on</v>

336
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>anatomy,</v>

337
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.080
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and botany.</v>

338
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.591
<v Speaker 1>He also,</v>

339
00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:30.020
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

340
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.340
<v Speaker 1>knew enough about geology to identify soil on clothing and shoes</v>

341
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.070
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

342
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 1>more and more detectives now goes into the habits of consulting with homes when</v>

343
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>they reached an impasse in their investigations,</v>

344
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.560
<v Speaker 1>even though they hated to admit this,</v>

345
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.390
<v Speaker 1>the young Pii would invariably provide them with the breakthrough that they</v>

346
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 1>needed in order to crack a case.</v>

347
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.621
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

348
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>81 homes began lodging with a man who would become inextricably tied to himself.</v>

349
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Dr John Watson.</v>

350
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>The address was two t one b Baker Street Watson was a young medic who had just</v>

351
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>returned from Afghanistan and was looking for a cheap place to live on the first</v>

352
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:05.511
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>

353
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Once it was fascinated that homes deduced that he had recently been in</v>

354
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan without him having profit.</v>

355
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:13.880
<v Speaker 1>That information from that moment on Watson was perks,</v>

356
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 1>fares part home seemed delighted to share his home with the affable Dr Watson,</v>

357
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>the two men would go onto for the partnership that has been an equals in the</v>

358
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 1>annals of criminal investigation as same as his reputation grew.</v>

359
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 1>He attracted more and more affluent clients and was able to charge higher fees.</v>

360
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 1>These hyphae cases subsidized others in which he helps people who could only pay</v>

361
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 1>a small fee or no fee at all.</v>

362
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.641
<v Speaker 1>He wants,</v>

363
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 1>says that the status of my clients is of less interest to me than the interest</v>

364
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.680
<v Speaker 1>of his case.</v>

365
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>What he was after,</v>

366
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>what cases that challenged him.</v>

367
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.140
<v Speaker 1>His greatest challenge came and his ongoing hunt for London's master criminal</v>

368
00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Professor Moriarty.</v>

369
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.250
<v Speaker 1>In order to avoid Moriarty's criminal organization.</v>

370
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Holmes was forced to flee Europe in late 18,</v>

371
00:15:56.801 --> 00:15:57.634
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>

372
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but the criminal masterminds pursued the great detective and it's a climactic</v>

373
00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:01.714
<v Speaker 1>struggle occurred.</v>

374
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Top Theater Reichenbach falls in Switzerland.</v>

375
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.660
<v Speaker 1>It appears that both men fall to their death and the funeral is held for the</v>

376
00:16:07.661 --> 00:16:09.010
<v Speaker 1>world's greatest detective.</v>

377
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:09.660
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

378
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:09.970
<v Speaker 1>homes,</v>

379
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>his body was never recovered and indeed he was not.</v>

380
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Debt for three years,</v>

381
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:15.370
<v Speaker 1>though he allowed the world,</v>

382
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Speaker 1>including Dr Watson to believe that he was dead.</v>

383
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.900
<v Speaker 1>This period is known by biographers as the great hiatus in 18,</v>

384
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:23.560
<v Speaker 1>94.</v>

385
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>He was suddenly back on the scene explaining to a bewildered Dr Watson that he</v>

386
00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:30.640
<v Speaker 1>had faked his death to get moriarty's henchmen off his back.</v>

387
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.733
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later,</v>

388
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.820
<v Speaker 1>homes retard to a small farm in Sussex downs where he took up beekeeping in</v>

389
00:16:39.821 --> 00:16:40.391
<v Speaker 1>1908.</v>

390
00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:44.170
<v Speaker 1>He came out of retirement in order to aid his governments working as a double</v>

391
00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 1>agents.</v>

392
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.840
<v Speaker 1>He masterminded the capture of a German spike.</v>

393
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It is believed he kept busy with intelligence work during the first world war.</v>

394
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.200
<v Speaker 1>There is no record of homes is activities after the war.</v>

395
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.360
<v Speaker 1>So when did Sherlock Holmes die?</v>

396
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.740
<v Speaker 1>The answer is obvious.</v>

397
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Just consider the Plethora of TV shows,</v>

398
00:16:58.841 --> 00:16:59.381
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

399
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:03.520
<v Speaker 1>and books on the man and he will surely agree that Sherlock Holmes had never</v>

400
00:17:03.521 --> 00:17:04.210
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

401
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 1>just as he had never lived.</v>

402
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock Holmes.</v>

403
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.870
<v Speaker 1>He's a complete work of fiction,</v>

404
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the creation of a writer by the name of Arthur Conan doyle.</v>

405
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.870
<v Speaker 1>That's if you've spent the last 20 minutes believing that you are learning the</v>

406
00:17:13.871 --> 00:17:15.370
<v Speaker 1>history of a real life human being,</v>

407
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not alone.</v>

408
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.250
<v Speaker 1>In a recent poll,</v>

409
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.060
<v Speaker 1>21 percent of respondents thought that the greatest sleuth of Baker Street</v>

410
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.500
<v Speaker 1>really did exist,</v>

411
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.460
<v Speaker 1>which just goes to show that sometimes fiction is stranger than truth.</v>

412
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.530
<v Speaker 1>That's you might notice that this video is published on April first April fools</v>

413
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:33.364
<v Speaker 1>to everybody,</v>

414
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.130
<v Speaker 1>so I really hope you enjoyed that episode of biographics.</v>

415
