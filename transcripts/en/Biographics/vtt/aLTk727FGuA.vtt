1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Honest hemingway was a man's man.</v>

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.290
<v Speaker 1>He was a war hero,</v>

3
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>a big game hunter from an adventure and bands,</v>

4
00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:05.941
<v Speaker 1>a bubble.</v>

5
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Laos a storyteller,</v>

6
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>yet his was a leaf.</v>

7
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It fills with contrasts.</v>

8
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>During his early years,</v>

9
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.224
<v Speaker 1>the future match.</v>

10
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Mom's mother dressed and treated him as a girl,</v>

11
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>met his own son.</v>

12
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Gregory would become made transvestite.</v>

13
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>He was also known as Papa Hemingway,</v>

14
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but he had a distant relationship with his own three sons.</v>

15
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>In the midst of the glowing tributes that the world heaped upon him,</v>

16
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>he sunk two terrible lows causing turmoil as he racked up awards.</v>

17
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>

18
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>in an act of desperation,</v>

19
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>he took his own life.</v>

20
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Does say that Hemingway,</v>

21
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>it was a complex individual,</v>

22
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>is perhaps the ultimate understatement.</v>

23
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>And in today's biographics video,</v>

24
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:47.201
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do our best to discover the real man behind the veneer of Papa</v>

25
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.253
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway.</v>

26
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

27
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Honest Miller Hemingway was born on July 1st,</v>

28
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>1899 at two eds and grace.</v>

29
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway.</v>

30
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Ed was a doctor in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park.</v>

31
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Grace was he talented opera singer who had been forced to give up a province in</v>

32
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

33
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you deport her eyesight?</v>

34
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>She was to replace the adulation she could have received by being a star with an</v>

35
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>abnormal obsession with her children.</v>

36
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>For the first six years of his life,</v>

37
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>young Ernie was dressed and treated as a girl by his mother.</v>

38
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>She had always wanted twin girls and made her son play that role to his older</v>

39
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:46.701
<v Speaker 1>sister Masalin as if FTU counter the feminizing influences of his wife Ed.</v>

40
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>He was a keen outdoorsman,</v>

41
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 1>would take his son camping alongside Lake Michigan for two months every year.</v>

42
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>The honest was allowed to dress as a boy.</v>

43
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Ends was introduced to do the manly arts of hunting and fishing.</v>

44
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Having where he though he remembered his father is a cruel man edge.</v>

45
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>It was often harsh to as children.</v>

46
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>If they misbehaved after whipping them with a razor strap,</v>

47
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>he would make them pray to God for forgiveness.</v>

48
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.490
<v Speaker 1>The Sun that developed a deep hatred for his father or eating that he would</v>

49
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>sometimes go into the shed shoulder,</v>

50
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>his father's hunting rifle and line up the old man in his sights.</v>

51
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

52
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 1>he was able to restrain himself from pulling that trigger.</v>

53
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Now in high school and his strive to be the center of attention.</v>

54
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>He was popular with his classmates throwing himself into every game,</v>

55
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 1>activity or prank.</v>

56
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

57
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>despite his enthusiasm,</v>

58
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.490
<v Speaker 1>he was not a very good sportsman,</v>

59
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>still wanting to impress.</v>

60
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:38.440
<v Speaker 1>He would make up stories about his prowess on the football fields and took these</v>

61
00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>friends and family.</v>

62
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It was in the creation of these tall tales that Ernest Hemingway was to discover</v>

63
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.640
<v Speaker 1>his true gift as a writer.</v>

64
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>It was Hemingway's English teacher that noticed his talents with the pen and</v>

65
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>encouraged the boys to try out for the school newspaper.</v>

66
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>He wanted a place on the writing team and we seem to publish his first story.</v>

67
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>The theme of that story would resonate with Hemingway for the rest of his life.</v>

68
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Coming to a tragic conclusion,</v>

69
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>45 years later,</v>

70
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the short story,</v>

71
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>it was cool to a judgement at [inaudible] and it was about a hunter who ends his</v>

72
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>life in a suicide.</v>

73
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>The story it was well received and Hemingway was spurred on to pursue a career</v>

74
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>in journalism against the wishes of his father who fully intended to become a</v>

75
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>

76
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>The boy's uncle.</v>

77
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>He was the friends of a tennis shoe at the Kansas City.</v>

78
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Star arranged an apprenticeship as a cub reporter.</v>

79
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>This 17 year old wants to handle the crime beat.</v>

80
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway absolutely threw himself into this job.</v>

81
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.430
<v Speaker 1>The first task was to devour the stars style book,</v>

82
00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>which was based upon their unique abbreviated pro style.</v>

83
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>It demands it the use of short sentences and introductory paragraphs along with</v>

84
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>simple language with an emphasis on vigorous English.</v>

85
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I think we would recall that this was the best writing advice that did it ever</v>

86
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.894
<v Speaker 1>received.</v>

87
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.670
<v Speaker 1>The entry of the United States into the first world war in 1917 was a major</v>

88
00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:12.350
<v Speaker 1>turning point in Hemingway's life.</v>

89
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 1>The patriotic fervor that was sweeping the nation's youth coupled with his in</v>

90
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.810
<v Speaker 1>his enthusiasm for adventure,</v>

91
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.860
<v Speaker 1>swept him up as he tried to join the army rejected because he had defective</v>

92
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

93
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.270
<v Speaker 1>He tried it again this time applying to the Red Cross ambulance division in SLE</v>

94
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>before in us.</v>

95
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>he was on a ship to Europe.</v>

97
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.463
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

98
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Who is it easily?</v>

99
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.490
<v Speaker 1>There's Hemingway was to get his first experience of the madly comradery and</v>

100
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:41.030
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

101
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 1>That was to mean so much to him.</v>

102
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.150
<v Speaker 1>He was able to drink,</v>

103
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>gambled Ben's corrals into the early hours with absolute impunity.</v>

104
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

105
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>What do you really longs for?</v>

106
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.300
<v Speaker 1>That was combat far away from the front lines.</v>

107
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:55.580
<v Speaker 1>His days were mainly spends in monotonous,</v>

108
00:04:55.581 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 1>dreary tasks.</v>

109
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.280
<v Speaker 1>He confided to her friends.</v>

110
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm fed up,</v>

111
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.270
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing here that scenery and too damn much of us.</v>

112
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get out of this ambulance section and see if I can't find out where</v>

113
00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:07.280
<v Speaker 1>this war is.</v>

114
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Pretty soon the wall,</v>

115
00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

116
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 1>it came to him on July the eighth 1918 he was delivering chocolate rations and</v>

117
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes to Italian soldiers on the PA river.</v>

118
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 1>He got caught in the middle of a German offensive from the other side of the</v>

119
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

120
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>A bomb exploded,</v>

121
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.670
<v Speaker 1>throwing Hemingway to the ground.</v>

122
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.500
<v Speaker 1>The soldier alongside him was killed,</v>

123
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but honest escaped with shrapnel wounds to his leg.</v>

124
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.041
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>

125
00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:31.490
<v Speaker 1>he managed to carry a wounded soldier to safety before collapsing into</v>

126
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness the way.</v>

127
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 1>he now became a patient at the Red Cross hospital in Milan and it was in this</v>

129
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:40.250
<v Speaker 1>hospital where he found his first glove lying in bed.</v>

130
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He became captivated with an American volunteer nurse by the name of agonist,</v>

131
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.920
<v Speaker 1>savant neuroscape during his month recuperation and it's an agonist explored the</v>

132
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 1>sites of Milan together,</v>

133
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I think weight.</v>

134
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 1>He became a numbered with a dark haired beauty who was seven years his senior</v>

135
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.891
<v Speaker 1>huffy things.</v>

136
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:55.341
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

137
00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>they were not so strong despite to marry him.</v>

138
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>At the war's end on New Year's Eve,</v>

139
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>1918 having way it was discharged from the Red Cross and returned to the family</v>

140
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>home in Oak Park.</v>

141
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>He took on the persona of a returning war hero telling the local paper that he</v>

142
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>was a soldier in the Italian army and relating how we had been personally</v>

143
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>decorated by the Italian king for bravery.</v>

144
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Something that totally never happens.</v>

145
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.413
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway's postwar high,</v>

147
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:28.680
<v Speaker 1>it was shattered by a breakup letter from agonists in it.</v>

148
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.603
<v Speaker 1>She wrote,</v>

149
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I am now and always will be too old,</v>

150
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.460
<v Speaker 1>and that's the truth as I can't get away from the facts that you're just a boy.</v>

151
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.593
<v Speaker 1>A kid.</v>

152
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.580
<v Speaker 1>This through earnest into a tailspin,</v>

153
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 1>he spends months loafing around the house until it's fed up.</v>

154
00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Mother finally tired of just moping around,</v>

155
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:44.520
<v Speaker 1>threw him out,</v>

156
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 1>grace while she gave him some sounds and sobering advice.</v>

157
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Unless you my son,</v>

158
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.320
<v Speaker 1>earnest CCR,</v>

159
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.250
<v Speaker 1>lazy loafing or trading on your handsome face to food,</v>

160
00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:57.000
<v Speaker 1>gullible little girls and neglecting your duty to God and your savior,</v>

161
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

162
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Unless you come into your manhood,</v>

163
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.490
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing before you but bankruptcy.</v>

164
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Whether this jolt of reality woke him up or not is still uncertain,</v>

165
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:10.860
<v Speaker 1>but what we do know is that it was enough to get earnest out of his funk and on</v>

166
00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:15.810
<v Speaker 1>his way to Chicago there he wrote articles for the Toronto Star and worked odd</v>

167
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 1>jobs to support himself as a party.</v>

168
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>One night,</v>

169
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>honest Matt,</v>

170

171
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>oddly was on a visit to the big city from Saint Louis.</v>

172
00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Having led a sheltered life under the influence of a domineering mother?</v>

173
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

174

<v Speaker 1>years older than him seems young army.</v>

176
00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:35.340
<v Speaker 1>How do you think for older women,</v>

177
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.500
<v Speaker 1>the relationship blossomed?</v>

178
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.553
<v Speaker 1>Nine months later,</v>

179
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.450
<v Speaker 1>earnest and Hadley,</v>

180

<v Speaker 1>they were married,</v>

181
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess down to the wedding was show would Anderson and up and coming writer who</v>

182
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.020
<v Speaker 1>a friend it Anderson encouraged the newlyweds to move to Paris.</v>

183
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 1>He gave out us.</v>

184
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>That is an introduction,</v>

185
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 1>so you literary friends,</v>

186
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 1>he resided on the left bank managing it to secure a position as a foreign</v>

187
00:07:56.461 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 1>correspondent for the Toronto Star.</v>

188
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Having weight took his bride and departed for a new life in Europe.</v>

189
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.673
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

190
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

191
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

192
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>He quickly inserted itself into the litter recess on Paris's left bank.</v>

193
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>The couple moved into a small flat,</v>

194
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>which sat next to a poppy that dance Saul Bass drawing on Hadley's trust funds</v>

195
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 1>adding.</v>

196
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.370
<v Speaker 1>We also rented a room on the top floor or they shatty hotel.</v>

197
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>He spent his mornings perfecting the craft of writing.</v>

199
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He told himself that all he needed to do was write one true sentence bars for</v>

200
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:37.424
<v Speaker 1>understanding way.</v>

201
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Being a writer meant seeing,</v>

202
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.711
<v Speaker 1>tasting,</v>

203
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:40.544
<v Speaker 1>and doing.</v>

204
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>He spent hours observing people in Paris.</v>

205
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Cafes chatted freely with strangers and spent long hours drinking with this</v>

206
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>writing buddies in Paris.</v>

207
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway,</v>

208
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>he was to come under the guidance of celebrated author and playwright Gertrude</v>

209
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Stein.</v>

210
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>She helped him to Paris words down to the essence of the idea and to perfect the</v>

211
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>style for which he would ultimately become famous in 1923 they're having ways</v>

212
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>that they took a trip to Spain that sparking a lifelong love affair with the</v>

213
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:06.444
<v Speaker 1>Spanish culture.</v>

214
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Then people honest also fell in love with the national obsession of bullfighting</v>

215
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.750
<v Speaker 1>in Pamplona.</v>

216
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.860
<v Speaker 1>The took his six month pregnant wife to watch the running of the Bulls while she</v>

217
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>hit her eyes from the spectacle of a husband was spousal bounds by the power and</v>

218
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>the passion of the events.</v>

219
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I think we would return to the running of the Bulls in Pamplona in the coming</v>

220
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

221
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 1>bringing a succession of literary friends with him.</v>

222
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.013
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

223
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.190
<v Speaker 1>These excursions.</v>

224
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.680
<v Speaker 1>They forms the backdrop to his first novel.</v>

225
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.180
<v Speaker 1>The Sun also rises through his association with F Scott Fitzgerald having boys</v>

226
00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:49.780
<v Speaker 1>work came to the notice of Charles Scribner publishers who published the Sun</v>

227
00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>also rises in 1926 this was Hemingway's real breakthrough.</v>

228
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>You're proving to be both a commercial bands.</v>

229
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.890
<v Speaker 1>The critical success.</v>

230
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a day in a new minimalistic writing style for which the world was</v>

231
00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:01.270
<v Speaker 1>more than ready.</v>

232
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.080
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

233
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.780
<v Speaker 1>not everyone was so impressed by this book.</v>

234
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>His mother sent him this scathing notes.</v>

235
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Surely you have other words in your vocabulary besides dam and bitch as having</v>

236
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:12.850
<v Speaker 1>ways to start elevators.</v>

237
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.220
<v Speaker 1>His private life began to disintegrate.</v>

238
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.690
<v Speaker 1>He had frequent fallings out with his or pals as he assumed the role of master</v>

239
00:10:19.691 --> 00:10:20.890
<v Speaker 1>to their apprenticeships.</v>

240
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.903
<v Speaker 1>His temper,</v>

241
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it was volcanic,</v>

242
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.660
<v Speaker 1>sometimes lead to fist fights and things.</v>

243
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

244
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 1>they are no better at home and threw himself into a passionate affair with a</v>

245
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:33.070
<v Speaker 1>friend of his wife by the name of Pauline Pfeiffer.</v>

246
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Hadley feeling deeply betrayed by both sides.</v>

247
00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Gave her first 100 days to decide who you wanted to be with.</v>

248
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.280
<v Speaker 1>He chose the more cosmopolitan Pfeiffer walked out.</v>

249
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

250
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.383
<v Speaker 1>it's wifey son.</v>

251
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

252
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway the also walked out on Paris in Pauline,</v>

253
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.590
<v Speaker 1>who had made a second wife,</v>

254
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 1>moved to the island of Key West Florida here,</v>

255
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:56.801
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

256
00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:58.960
<v Speaker 1>reinvented himself as a deep sea fishermen,</v>

257
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:03.430
<v Speaker 1>integrating himself with a group of hard working and hard drinking seafarers who</v>

258
00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:07.330
<v Speaker 1>were a world away from the gentle intellectuals that had left behind in Paris.</v>

259
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.643
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

260
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Fishermen Hemingway reveled in the machismo of his new lifestyle.</v>

261
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.500
<v Speaker 1>During the day he fished along the Cuban coast and at night he smuggled rum for</v>

262
00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:28.610
<v Speaker 1>his local hangout with the proceeds rolling in from the sun also rises and does</v>

263
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.241
<v Speaker 1>next novel,</v>

264
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:30.290
<v Speaker 1>a farewell to arms.</v>

265
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.670
<v Speaker 1>He built his own boat,</v>

266
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:35.210
<v Speaker 1>calls the pillar and set about to becoming the world's greatest deep sea</v>

267
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:35.990
<v Speaker 1>fishermen.</v>

268
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.170
<v Speaker 1>He proceeded to win every fishing contest on the Atlantic.</v>

269
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 1>When the locals became upset,</v>

270
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.070
<v Speaker 1>he told them that they could win their trophy back,</v>

271
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but first they have to last three rounds in a boxing ring with m and s.</v>

272
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.593
<v Speaker 1>nobody could,</v>

274
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>but still during all of this time,</v>

275
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway's love it was writing.</v>

276
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.770
<v Speaker 1>He rose at 5:00 AM each day and it's worked at his typewriter until midday.</v>

277
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

278
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.240
<v Speaker 1>he would give his total focus to the rest and worse.</v>

279
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Then after lunch,</v>

280
00:12:00.331 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>he would throw himself into his other life that have the hard living,</v>

281
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.120
<v Speaker 1>heavy drinking man of action.</v>

282
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.463
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

283
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 1>During the key west is instant.</v>

284
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Pauline has two children of their own.</v>

285
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Both of them putting Pauline through marathon myriads of labor tabs.</v>

286
00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:20.491
<v Speaker 1>Then well,</v>

287
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>she proved to be a pretty terrible mother,</v>

288
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.100
<v Speaker 1>a woman who clearly did not like the inconvenience of having children.</v>

289
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway himself.</v>

290
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:27.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

291
00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:28.920
<v Speaker 1>he was also a lousy father.</v>

292
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.400
<v Speaker 1>He would have periods of intense interest in his boys and then completely ignore</v>

293
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:33.510
<v Speaker 1>them for months at a time.</v>

294
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.040
<v Speaker 1>In 1933 having weight discovered a whole new world of adventure when he set out</v>

295
00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:39.750
<v Speaker 1>on a hunting safari in Africa,</v>

296
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.280
<v Speaker 1>he was mesmerized by the natural beauty of the Serengeti plain justice.</v>

297
00:12:44.281 --> 00:12:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He was getting into the hunt.</v>

298
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.060
<v Speaker 1>He was struck with a terrible bout of dysentery.</v>

299
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.530
<v Speaker 1>He was flown to a hospital then Nairobi to recover the plane that flew over the</v>

300
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:53.430
<v Speaker 1>majestic mountains.</v>

301
00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Kilimanjaro providing the inspiration for his most celebrated short story of the</v>

302
00:12:58.261 --> 00:13:02.640
<v Speaker 1>it snows of Kilimanjaro after his recovery having returned to the hunts where he</v>

303
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:06.270
<v Speaker 1>managed to bag buffalo out to low pans and lions during all this time,</v>

304
00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:10.080
<v Speaker 1>he was soaking up the atmosphere for inclusion in the later works of fiction</v>

305
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.190
<v Speaker 1>back in key west.</v>

306
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway continued his heart living lifestyle.</v>

307
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.220
<v Speaker 1>During the early thirties he began an affair with an American woman who lived in</v>

308
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Havana honest,</v>

309
00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:20.730
<v Speaker 1>would spend increasing amounts of time with her in Cuba.</v>

310
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.220
<v Speaker 1>While this frustrated why I've struggled to cope with the children.</v>

311
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1936 he began an affair with Martha Gellhorn need journalist and writer</v>

312
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Gellhorn that had the same sense of journalistic adventurous Hemingway.</v>

313
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And in 1937 they made the decision that to cover the Spanish civil war together,</v>

314
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I think we arrived in Spain as a reporter for the American newspaper Alliance.</v>

315
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

316
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.130
<v Speaker 1>he seemed became involved in a Dutch film production goals,</v>

317
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>at least Spanish earth when the screenwriter quit need took on the duties for</v>

318
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:48.300
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

319
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.021
<v Speaker 1>After a few months,</v>

320
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:50.130
<v Speaker 1>seat returned to America,</v>

321
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>showing the film in Hollywood and to raising at $20,000 for the Spanish</v>

322
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Republicans.</v>

323
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.250
<v Speaker 1>His month in Spain provided the basis for Hemingway's best selling novel about</v>

324
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the civil war for whom the bell tolls those months while they also fueled the</v>

325
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>flames of passion with Martha Gellhorn.</v>

326
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.860
<v Speaker 1>A short time after returning to key west,</v>

327
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.491
<v Speaker 1>he divorced.</v>

328
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Pauline said that tea.</v>

329
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Good Mary Martha.</v>

330
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.050
<v Speaker 1>In 1939 the newlyweds Steve moved to Cuba.</v>

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They settle into a beautiful villa on the outskirts of Havana and he has a</v>

333
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Havana had to offer.</v>

334
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Cuba was also a sportsman's paradise,</v>

335
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:24.401
<v Speaker 1>allowing Hemingway,</v>

336
00:14:24.401 --> 00:14:27.330
<v Speaker 1>do you indulge his great passion for deep sea fishing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a prominent Gregorio during the hurricane season to Cuba that you Hemingway's,</v>

343
00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 1>they decided to live in Sun Valley,</v>

344
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Idaho.</v>

345
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

346
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Honesty was able to partake in the hunting and fresh water fishing that he'd</v>

347
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:50.640
<v Speaker 1>done with his father as a boy.</v>

348
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.090
<v Speaker 1>During this time he became close friends with stars.</v>

349
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Gary Cooper runs Marlene Dietrich.</v>

350
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>He took on the life of something of a celebrity himself.</v>

351
00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.371
<v Speaker 1>Errol Flynn,</v>

352
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.001
<v Speaker 1>Jane Russell,</v>

353
00:14:59.001 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>and Ingrid Bergman,</v>

354
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>regular visitors to Sun Valley back in Cuba.</v>

355
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>He would in stain the likes of Spencer Tracy and the Duchess of Windsor at the</v>

356
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Floridita bar in Havana.</v>

357
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It was Hemingway himself,</v>

358
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>who was the acknowledged star of Havana.</v>

359
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>The locals think we're always delighted to have it in their midst.</v>

360
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 1>They were just as impressed with his ability to drink anyone under the table</v>

361
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Bosley where with this literary fame.</v>

362
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:20.511
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

363
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Even as his wild nights on the town in Nevada became more decadent and then</v>

364
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.331
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

365
00:15:24.331 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It never strayed from his disciplined writing regimen.</v>

366
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 1>He continued to produce quality work with religious zeal.</v>

367
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 1>One true sentence at a time,</v>

368
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>and it was during this time that international accolades began at showering</v>

369
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway in response to for whom the bells toll this was widely regarded as a</v>

370
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:41.840
<v Speaker 1>literary masterpiece.</v>

371
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.681
<v Speaker 1>Ernest Hemingway,</v>

372
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 1>the writer was transforming himself into Papa Hemingway,</v>

373
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>the white whisker literary genius,</v>

374
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 1>who was also the big,</v>

375
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.810
<v Speaker 1>loud and burly Alpha male.</v>

376
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.230
<v Speaker 1>When World War Two they organize it has also created tensions in far off Havana.</v>

377
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Martha Gellhorn Hemingway protect career ahead of her family and set off to</v>

378
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:12.221
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

379
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a war correspondent novel Hemingway.</v>

380
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It was furious telling everyone within earshot or that he had a good mind to</v>

381
00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:19.600
<v Speaker 1>follow after her and kick her ass.</v>

382
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

383
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Tell her she should either come home or go to military school.</v>

384
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

385
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Martha was becoming politically active in support of the allies.</v>

386
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.280
<v Speaker 1>She encouraged Hemingway to use his influence to rally support.</v>

387
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.390
<v Speaker 1>He ignored her pleas,</v>

388
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but finally I left for London as a correspondence for Colliers magazine.</v>

389
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 1>He joins the ref on bombing missions and Holly,</v>

390
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the fourth infantry across Normandy in the week of the d day.</v>

391
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Invasion on returning from the water to form that having where greatly</v>

392
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:48.220
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated the party played in defeating the Germans just as he had done at the</v>

393
00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:49.480
<v Speaker 1>end of World War One.</v>

394
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 1>The military got word of his claims and again,</v>

395
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:53.410
<v Speaker 1>looking further into them,</v>

396
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>they discovered that Hemingway had violated his status as a noncombatant</v>

397
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.110
<v Speaker 1>reporter bond many occasions,</v>

398
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.240
<v Speaker 1>and he was charged with numerous rule violations when it came to his defense of</v>

399
00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 1>number of high ranking officer's testified with one stating that Hemingway was</v>

400
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.260
<v Speaker 1>without question.</v>

401
00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.540
<v Speaker 1>One of the most courageous men I've ever known.</v>

402
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Fear is a stranger to him having weight.</v>

403
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.440
<v Speaker 1>He was cleared of all charges and later awarded a Bronze Star for bravery as a</v>

404
00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:18.490
<v Speaker 1>war correspondent.</v>

405
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.873
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

406
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

407
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.460
<v Speaker 1>was ends.</v>

408
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Martha left the marriage,</v>

409
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.090
<v Speaker 1>fed up with our husbands shamanistic tendencies,</v>

410
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.931
<v Speaker 1>but Hemingway,</v>

411
00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:35.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

412
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:37.150
<v Speaker 1>he already had a replacement in the wings.</v>

413
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It was a fellow walker respondents by the name of the Mary Welsch.</v>

414
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Mary would be by his side,</v>

415
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.240
<v Speaker 1>right until the end.</v>

416
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.320
<v Speaker 1>In the late 1940s Hemingway's excessive drinking began taking a toll on his</v>

417
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>physical and mental health for the time the quality of his writing began to</v>

418
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 1>suffer,</v>

419
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 1>which was hugely frustrating for him.</v>

420
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Finally after a trip to where to lead during which he engaged in a passionate</v>

421
00:17:57.481 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 1>affair with a gal in our twenties they published across the river and into the</v>

422
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

423
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>The critics,</v>

424
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 1>they absolutely slammed it and for the first time having,</v>

425
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 1>we felt the sting of literary rejection,</v>

426
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.720
<v Speaker 1>the consensus as well as that the old man,</v>

427
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>he no longer had the gift for having well.</v>

428
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 1>This was like a red flag to a bull.</v>

429
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 1>He completed his next novel in just eight weeks.</v>

430
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That novel was the older man of the sea and to became the defining work of his</v>

431
00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

432
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the aging champ,</v>

433
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>he had regained his title and with a vengeance,</v>

434
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.940
<v Speaker 1>silencing the critics and claiming Veem 1953 Pulitzer Prize for literature.</v>

435
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1954 Hemingway,</v>

436
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>he was on safari in Africa.</v>

437
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>When his light plane went down in the jungle,</v>

438
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.560
<v Speaker 1>smashing his head against the door to a furnace.</v>

439
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 1>He saved the life of all onboard but suffered permanent head injuries in the</v>

440
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 1>wake of the Cuban revolution.</v>

441
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway's left Avanir in July of 1960 and to move to Idaho here,</v>

442
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.271
<v Speaker 1>his health,</v>

443
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 1>both mental and physical,</v>

444
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 1>rapidly deteriorated.</v>

445
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.900
<v Speaker 1>He was admitted to the Mayo Clinic and it's given electroshock therapy to treat</v>

446
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 1>his depression.</v>

447
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.281
<v Speaker 1>This rob,</v>

448
00:18:56.281 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 1>to the master wordsmith off his greatest rating tool is memory.</v>

449
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 1>And without that you have nothing understanding why he committed suicide with</v>

450
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 1>his favorite hunting rifle on July 2nd,</v>
