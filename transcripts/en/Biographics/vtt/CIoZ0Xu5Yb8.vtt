00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>So you might agree with this statement.</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>If you fancy yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He is mostly known for writing a book called the Prince.</v>

9
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>The handbook established him as the father of modern political theory through</v>

<v Speaker 1>not particularly affluent,</v>

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but they have means Machiavelli was born during a tumultuous time in history in</v>

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>aside from the fact that he was well versed in the ancient classics among these</v>

32
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli's first recorded involvement in the volatile Florentine political</v>

33
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 1>scene occurred in 1498 when he helps the political faction that depose gear</v>

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.391
<v Speaker 1>In the same year,</v>

39
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Macchia valley was appointed to the second chancery of the Republic as</v>

43
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>to foreign governments.</v>

44
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>These posts allowed him many opportunities over the next 14 years,</v>

45
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:27.310
<v Speaker 1>which allowed him to closely examine the inner workings of government,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was a well respected assistant to be Republican.</v>

51
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Head of state,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Piero Soderini in 1512 Spanish forces invaded Italy and the Florentine political</v>

53
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 1>climates changed abruptly.</v>

54
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.740
<v Speaker 1>The Medici family where the rulers of Florence for centuries,</v>

55
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but in 1494 and they were exiled,</v>

56
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>allowing for an autocratic regime to seize,</v>

<v Speaker 1>not here valley.</v>

58
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It was purged from office jails and then tortured for is well known Republican</v>

59
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>sentiments.</v>

60
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It was also finally banished to his country of residence in pack Kasina.</v>

61
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>You've already spent this time offering these small body of political writings</v>

62
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360
<v Speaker 1>that sealed his place in history completed between 1513 and 1517 discourses upon</v>

63
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>the first decade of t Livia and the prints were not published until after</v>

64
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli's death in 1531 and 1532 respectively.</v>

65
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Around 1518 he turned from pros to drama in La.</v>

66
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Mandra Gola likely offers other writings.</v>

67
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>It is firmly predicated on an astute and unsentimental awareness that human</v>

68
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>nature is flawed and given to self centeredness.</v>

69
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>The play was popular with audiences throughout much of Italy for several years.</v>

70
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that Steph say,</v>

71
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>military treatise published in 1521 and didn't title the Libero.</v>

72
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Della Rta dela Guerra.</v>

73
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>The Art of war was the only historical or political work published during the</v>

74
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>author's lifetime.</v>

75
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.471
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

76
00:03:56.471 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Macchia valley had made several attempts to gain favor with the Medici,</v>

77
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>including dedicating the Prince de Lorenzo in 1520 he was appointed official</v>

78
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>historian of Florence and was subsequently and trusted with minor governmental</v>

79
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>duties.</v>

80
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>His prodigious history of Florence carefully dilutes his Republican platform</v>

81
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>with the DC and bias expected of him.</v>

82
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>In 1525 pope Clement the seventh recognize his achievements with a monetary</v>

83
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>stipends two years later,</v>

84
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the Medici where again,</v>

85
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>ousted and Macchia valley's hopes for advancement under the revived republic.</v>

86
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>We're frustrated this was because the new governments were suspicious of his</v>

87
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.210
<v Speaker 1>ties to the Medici Dessau,</v>

88
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Austin's by his country's internal strife,</v>

89
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Macchia value fell gravely ill and died a disillusions man.</v>

90
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>His dream of an operational republic.</v>

91
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Unrealized critics have found it ironic that the fist and the Republican</v>

92
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli should have written a handbook advising an autocratic leader how</v>

93
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>best to acquire and maintain power and security.</v>

94
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli was acutely aware,</v>

95
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

96
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>foreign threats to Italian autonomy and is thus deemed necessary for a strong</v>

97
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.481
<v Speaker 1>prince.</v>

98
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Two fought French and Spanish hedger money.</v>

99
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Hence the Prince was addressed to the ruling MEDICI.</v>

100
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He believes there's a shrewd head of state exemplified by Boria was essential to</v>

101
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>sublimated self interest to Commonwealth,</v>

102
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>that since handbooks of conduct music monarchal needs had become immensely</v>

103
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>popular by the 14 hundreds the external form of the prince was neither startling</v>

104
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 1>nor particularly remarkable to Machiavelli's contemporaries.</v>

105
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yet from its initial appearance,</v>

106
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the prince proved no mere manual of protocol,</v>

107
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>nor for even that matter of even conventional strategy in its chapters,</v>

108
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli delineated a typology of sovereignties and the deployment of</v>

109
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>available forces,</v>

110
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.941
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>

111
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>political or psychological,</v>

112
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>to acquire and retain them.</v>

113
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>The prince is the first political treaters to divorce statecraft from ethics as</v>

114
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli wrote,</v>

115
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>how one lives is so far removed from how one ought to live,</v>

116
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that he who abandons what one does for what one ought to do,</v>

117
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>learns rather his own ruin than is preservation adding to his unflinching</v>

118
00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.170
<v Speaker 1>realism.</v>

119
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>The common renaissance belief in humanity has capacity for determining its same</v>

120
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>

121
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli evaluate,</v>

122
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>posited to fundamentals and necessary for effective political leadership,</v>

123
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Vertigo and for tuna virtually refers to the princess own abilities,</v>

124
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>ideally a combination of force and cunning four to now to the unpredictable</v>

125
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 1>influence of fortune and a significant departure from previous political</v>

126
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

127
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>The designs of providence play no part in Machiavelli's skim on issues of</v>

128
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:26.481
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

129
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Heather t masked by other political theorists in vague,</v>

130
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>diplomatic terms.</v>

131
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli presented his thesis in direct Kansas and often passionate speech.</v>

132
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>He employed easily grasped metaphors and structured the whole thing and an</v>

133
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>aphoristic vein,</v>

134
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>which lends it a compelling authority.</v>

135
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Reactions to the prince miss initially,</v>

136
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>but only briefly favorable.</v>

137
00:06:57.191 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 1>We've Catherine de Medici said to have enthusiastic included this among other of</v>

138
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli's writings in the educational curriculum of our children,</v>

139
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 1>but within a short time,</v>

140
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.200
<v Speaker 1>the book fell in z widespread disfavor becoming viewed as a handbook for</v>

141
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 1>atheistic tyranny.</v>

142
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.960
<v Speaker 1>The Prince Sends Akea Valleys,</v>

143

<v Speaker 1>other writings as well what placed in the people index if prohibited books.</v>

144
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And 1559 the prince was also held responsible for fringe political corruption</v>

145
00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and for widespread contribution to any number of political and moral vices.</v>

146
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Genzler lays interpretation of the prince as advocating stage craft by</v>

147
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.890
<v Speaker 1>ruthlessness and amoral.</v>

148
00:07:32.891 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Duplicity was disseminated throughout Britain through the works of such popular</v>

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:37.541
<v Speaker 1>rens,</v>

150
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>highly influential dramatists as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe in</v>

151
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>the prologue to Marlowe's the Jew of Malta from 50 99 Machiavelli addresses the</v>

152
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:50.800
<v Speaker 1>audience so length at one point encapsulating the Elizabethan perception of</v>

153
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli by saying I count religion.</v>

154
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a childish toy and holds.</v>

155
00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 1>There is no sin but ignorance here and in the works of malaise contemporaries,</v>

156
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli was depicted as an agents of all the Protestant England despised in</v>

157
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Catholic high renaissance Italy.</v>

158
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Hostile English interpreters so effectively typified Macchia valley as an</v>

159
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>amalgam of various evils.</v>

160
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 1>The term Machiavellian is still used today,</v>

161
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.060
<v Speaker 1>rally until the 19th century.</v>

162
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Did mention of the prince solicit anything other than unfounded as largely</v>

163
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Speaker 1>unexamined repugnance as Freddy Cheer.</v>

164
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Pally has absolutely summarized centuries,</v>

165
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:32.380
<v Speaker 1>have to elapse before the distinction between moral moments and political</v>

166
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:36.160
<v Speaker 1>moments between technical approach and moralistic generalities.</v>

167
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Even between the subject matter of the book and the authors person,</v>

168
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>we're finally achieved modern critics noting these crucial distinctions,</v>

169
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:48.970
<v Speaker 1>having engaged in a prolonged and animated discussion concerning Macchia values.</v>

170
00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:53.620
<v Speaker 1>True intent in the prince and anomalous 17th century commentator philosopher</v>

171
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Pierre Bayle found it strange that there are so many people who believe that</v>

172
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Machiavel teaches prince's dangerous politics.</v>

173
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.530
<v Speaker 1>For on the contrary,</v>

174
00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>it princess of taught Mackey ravel what he has risen since bales time.</v>

175
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Further analysis is prompted to the most prolonged animated discussion relating</v>

176
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>to the work.</v>

177
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>The true intents of its creator was the treatise as bail suggested,</v>

178
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 1>a faithful representation of principally contact,</v>

179
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>which might justify or the incriminated subjects,</v>

180
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>but not it's chronic Heller or had Macchia valley in his manner of presentation,</v>

181
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>devise the volume as a vehicle for his own commentary.</v>

182
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Still more calculatedly at the author superseded description in ably providing a</v>

183
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.380
<v Speaker 1>legacy for dead spots.</v>

184
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>A single conclusion concerning the author's motive has not been drawn.</v>

185
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>The patterns of conjecture of certainly appeared within Macchia valleys.</v>

186
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Critical heritage Lord Macaulay and emphasizing the writers Republican Zealand,</v>

187
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 1>those privation see suffered in its behalf,</v>

188
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.120
<v Speaker 1>has contended that it is inconceivable that the motto of freedom should have</v>

189
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>designed diddly acted as the apostle of tyranny.</v>

190
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>The peculiar immorality which is rendered the prince and popular belonged rather</v>

191
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 1>to the age than to the man.</v>

192
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Others have echoed this suggestion examining the work and its historical</v>

193
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

194
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>John Addington Simons has deemed it simply a handbook of prince crafts.</v>

195
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 1>As that art was commonly received,</v>

196
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Nestle,</v>

197
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 1>where the principles of public morality had been translated into terms of</v>

198
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>material aggrandizement,</v>

199
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>glory gain,</v>

200
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.083
<v Speaker 1>and greatness.</v>

201
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Many of Machiavelli intended the treatise as a veiled satiric attack on the</v>

202
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>methods of Italian tyranny or by a truce methods.</v>

203
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 1>It's confess according to Harold j Lasky,</v>

204
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the prince is a textbook for the house of Muddy.</v>

205
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:41.220
<v Speaker 1>See sit hounds in the tons that I mean history would make them appreciate it and</v>

206
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>set out that it's author might hope for their realization of his insights into</v>

207
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 1>the business of government while ultimately unable to agree on the underlying</v>

208
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 1>purpose of the prince.</v>

209
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Nearly all critics have nonetheless been persuaded of it's masterful</v>

210
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 1>composition,</v>

211
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>even when unwilling to endorse its principles.</v>

212
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Mccauley has a firms that's the judicious ends.</v>

213
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Ken's in minds of Macchia valley shows itself in his luminous manly and it's</v>

214
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>polished language and Francesco to sanctus has determined to this where he was</v>

215
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:09.990
<v Speaker 1>quite unconscious a form.</v>

216
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>He was a master a form without looking for Italian prose.</v>

217
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.373
<v Speaker 1>You found it.</v>

218
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>The sheer volume and intensity studies of the prince of far exceeded those</v>

219
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>directed a Mackie of how these discourses.</v>

220
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.271
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

221
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 1>the last work has been acknowledged as an essential companion piece.</v>

222
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Do the format,</v>

223

<v Speaker 1>all of the authors,</v>

224
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>subsequent studies treating history,</v>

225
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>political science and military theory stem from this dissertation that contains</v>

226
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the most original thought of Macchia valley,</v>

227
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>less flamboyant than the prints and narrow or in its margin for interpretation.</v>

228
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.650
<v Speaker 1>The discourses contains Macchia Valleys,</v>

229
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.420
<v Speaker 1>undisguised admiration for ancient governmental forms and is most elegant,</v>

230
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly explicated republicanism.</v>

231
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Commentators have noted the presence of gravity and Skillful Rick that at times</v>

232
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>punctuate prince but are in full evidence only in that works.</v>

233
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.753
<v Speaker 1>Final chapter,</v>

234
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>a memorable exhortation to the Medicis to resist foreign tyranny.</v>

235
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>The discourse is also presents that methodical extrapolation of political theory</v>

236
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 1>from historical documentation,</v>

237

<v Speaker 1>which is intimate and in the Prince Max.</v>

238
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Alina has observed this if the prince is great because it gives us the grammar</v>

239
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 1>of power for a government for discourse is a great because they give us the</v>

240
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:20.670
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of organic unity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Knots in the governments put in a state and the conditions under which a loan a</v>

242
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:26.410
<v Speaker 1>culture can survive.</v>

243
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.890
<v Speaker 1>It has been deemed not at all in Congress that an intellect in Merced in</v>

244
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>historical circumstance and political impetus should say naturally embrace</v>

245
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>comedy as well.</v>

246
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 1>For Machiavelli regarded comedy exactly as he conceived history and interplay of</v>

247
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 1>forces leading unavoidably to a given results.</v>

248
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli's manager Gola is only work in the comedic genre,</v>

249
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 1>clearly reflected this parallel.</v>

250

<v Speaker 1>It's not practice has remarked this under the frivolous surface of Mandra Gola</v>

<v Speaker 1>spiritual forces as inevitable as fate.</v>

254
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 1>It is enough to know the characters to guests the ends,</v>

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 1>just blind to characterization that is rudimentary,</v>

279
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>haphazard,</v>

280
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 1>and inconsistent with even protagonists going through their motions like</v>

281
00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:01.460
<v Speaker 1>automata.</v>

282
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Mccauley,</v>

283
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.411
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

284
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>is applauded the players correct and vigorous delineation of human nature.</v>

285
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It decided influence on the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes and Sir Francis Bacon</v>

286
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 1>and eggs on the thoughts of such modern political theorists says,</v>

287
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Vilfredo Pareto.</v>

288
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli has been [inaudible] the founder of empirical political science,</v>

289
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>primarily on the strength of the discourses and the prints taken in historical</v>

290
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:22.571
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

291
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 1>It is understandable that the prince should have dwarfed Machiavelli's other</v>

292
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>works for with this slim treatise,</v>

293
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.910
<v Speaker 1>the author confronted the ramifications of power when it's procurement and</v>

294
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

295
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>when notably preemptory commentators have come to weigh the integrity of</v>

296
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli's controversial fought against the pressing political conditions</v>

297
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:41.704
<v Speaker 1>which formed us.</v>

298
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like Roberto Ridalfi have endeavored through their studies to dislodge</v>

299
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the longstanding perception of Machiavelli valley as a ruthless character</v>

300
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 1>stating in judging Macchia valley one to take accounts of his anguish,</v>

301
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 1>despair of virtue,</v>

302
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.360
<v Speaker 1>and just tragic sense of evil on the basis of sentences taken out of context and</v>

303
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 1>is of outward appearances.</v>

304
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>He was judged a cold and cynical man,</v>

305
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.210
<v Speaker 1>a snare,</v>

306
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 1>a to religion and virtue,</v>

307
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>but in fact there is hardly a page of his writing and certainly no action of</v>

308
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>life that does not show him to be passionate,</v>

309
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 1>generous audits and basically religious Peter Bonds and other has stated in</v>

310
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 1>European writers Makaveli.</v>

311
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:22.520
<v Speaker 1>It created a new religion out of politics with all its faithful implications for</v>

312
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 1>modern intellectual history.</v>

313
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.150
<v Speaker 1>In 59 to Machiavelli married Marietta Corps Sini.</v>

314
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.770
<v Speaker 1>The couple had six children together,</v>

315
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.150
<v Speaker 1>four sons and two daughters.</v>

316
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Niccolo Machiavelli's the prince is one of the most celebrated and notorious</v>

317
00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:47.110
<v Speaker 1>books in the history of Western political thought,</v>

318
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.120
<v Speaker 1>most celebrated and notorious books in the history of Western political thought.</v>

319
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It continues to influence discussions of war and peace,</v>

320
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>the nature of politics and the relation of private ethics to public duties.</v>

321
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Ostensibly a 16th century manual of instruction on certain aspects of Princeton.</v>

322
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.540
<v Speaker 1>He rule in behavior.</v>

323
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.710
<v Speaker 1>The prints anticipates and complicates modern political and philosophical</v>

324
00:16:08.711 --> 00:16:09.520
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

325
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.770
<v Speaker 1>What is the right order of society?</v>

326
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Can Western politics still be the model for progress toward peace and prosperity</v>

327
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.830
<v Speaker 1>or does our freedom to create our individual purposes and pursuits undermine our</v>

328
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:22.060
<v Speaker 1>public responsibilities?</v>

329
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Are the characters of our politics markedly different?</v>

330
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.600
<v Speaker 1>For better or for worse than the politics of the era's?</v>

331
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Machiavelli argues that there is no ideal transcending and daughter to which one</v>

332
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:38.080
<v Speaker 1>can conform and that the right order is merely the one that has the capacity to</v>

333
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.190
<v Speaker 1>persist over time.</v>

334
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.721
<v Speaker 1>The prince,</v>

335
00:16:39.721 --> 00:16:44.440
<v Speaker 1>his emphasis on the importance of an effective truth over any abstract ideal</v>

336
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Marxist as one of the first works of modern political philosophy.</v>
