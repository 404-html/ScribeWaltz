00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Christopher columbus has become a controversial historical figure.</v>

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I claims for centuries as the discovery of America.</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.663
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't.</v>

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>He has gains notoriety for the decimation of the native peoples that he</v>

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>encountered obsessed with obtaining goals,</v>

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>slaves in order to pay off debt and impress the king and queen of Spain.</v>

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>He ended up as an outcast on ones that in the place that he discovered and sent</v>

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>back to Spain in disgrace.</v>

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at the uncomfortable truth about Christopher Columbus.</v>

11
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>There is no agreed upon date as to when Christopher Columbus entered into the</v>

12
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:45.610
<v Speaker 1>weld.</v>

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Some historians put the date as early as 1436,</v>

14
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:51.820
<v Speaker 1>but others claim that it was as late as 1455.</v>

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>The majority agree though that he was born sometime between August the 25th and</v>

16
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>October 31st in 14,</v>

17
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.043
<v Speaker 1>51.</v>

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>The place of his birth,</v>

19
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

20
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>That's something we do know for certain.</v>

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>It's the Italian coastal city of genuine.</v>

22
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Christopher was the oldest of five children,</v>

23
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 1>born to Susanna Fontana,</v>

24
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Rossa and Dominica Colombo.</v>

25
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>The name Columbus is an English derivation of the Italian Colombo.</v>

26
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Dominica was a weaver and an innkeeper,</v>

27
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>but he was also a keen seafarer and his love of the ocean would soon transfer to</v>

28
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>his oldest son as early as age 10,</v>

29
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Christopher ranged up and down the genuine harbor in borrowed single man</v>

30
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:34.051
<v Speaker 1>sailboats and dreams of venturing out into the vast expanse beyond.</v>

31
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>We know very little about Christopher's early life,</v>

32
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that his father was able to provide a modest yet comfortable</v>

33
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>living for the family and that he was a kindly involved man who brought his sons</v>

34
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>up with strong biblical morals.</v>

35
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.600
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know if young Christopher went to school.</v>

36
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.640
<v Speaker 1>It was recorded that he was a great intellect,</v>

37
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>this listen education,</v>

38
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>and so he may have been illiterate when he left home at around the age of 20.</v>

39
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

40
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>he overcame his lack of formal education by teaching himself many valuable</v>

41
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>skills including matt making functional mathematics and the range of languages</v>

42
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.420
<v Speaker 1>including Spanish,</v>

43
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>

44
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>and Portuguese.</v>

45
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>By the time he sailed to the Americas,</v>

46
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>he had also learned to read and to write.</v>

47
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>It is generally agreed that Columbus first went to see at the age of 14,</v>

49
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>he began his Maritime Korea as a messenger and worked his way up to the position</v>

50
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 1>of common sailor for the next six years.</v>

51
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>He works in a variety of ships that plying the European oceans.</v>

52
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>A legend has emerged at the age of 21 columbus tried his hand at piracy.</v>

53
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>He was in the employee of Duke Renea.</v>

54
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I've owned Jew who had appointed the young man to capture a warship in the Tunis</v>

55
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 1>harbor in North Africa on roots of the men with Columbus,</v>

56
00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>got Tim Ids and persuaded him to send him back to France and gathered</v>

57
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>reinforcements.</v>

58
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>The story goes that during the night,</v>

59
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Columbus played a trick on his men by altering the ship's compass so that they</v>

60
00:02:57.071 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>sailed south instead of north.</v>

61
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.071
<v Speaker 1>When they broke,</v>

62
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>they were within sight of the target.</v>

63
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>Washington's Columbus managed to Ronnie as men for a successful attack.</v>

64
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Many scholars dismissed the accounts due to the fact that Columbus was only 21,</v>

65
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>which seems far too young to be given such a command.</v>

66
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>There's more certainty regarding a voyage that he took two years later.</v>

67
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>The destination was the Greek islands of kiosks in the Aegean Sea.</v>

68
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>He ends the rest of the crew.</v>

69
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Spent a year on the islands in 1476 at the age of 25 Columbus first ventured</v>

70
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>beyond the realms of the Mediterranean and into the wider oceans beyond.</v>

71
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>He was part of a fleet of five ships,</v>

72
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>bound for Lisbon in Portugal on route to the fleet was attacked by a Franco</v>

73
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese war fleet.</v>

74
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>In the ensuing battleships from both sides,</v>

75
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>went down with hundreds of men.</v>

76
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Drowning Columbus was on the big hello,</v>

77
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>which was struck and sunk by a French worship.</v>

78
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It was only a stroke of fortune that ended up saving Christopher's life diving</v>

79
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:52.901
<v Speaker 1>into the sea.</v>

80
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>He managed to clean to a floating or and used it as a boy.</v>

81
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>He's against the Portuguese shore at lag Os some six miles away.</v>

82
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Luckily the people of Lagos took him in and he's got him back to good health.</v>

83
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>He managed to make his way from the to Lisbon where he joins up with a large</v>

84
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:07.620
<v Speaker 1>colony of January.</v>

85
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>His ship builders,</v>

86
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>merchants,</v>

87
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>in 1477,</v>

88
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>he joined a voyage to Iceland,</v>

89
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>which he described as much beyond the limit of the West.</v>

90
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>We're to Lisbon.</v>

91
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>He learns much of the inner workings of the seafaring trait.</v>

92
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>This port city was the center of seafaring voyage and discovery.</v>

93
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>It was the place where stories of what lay beyond we're told and schemes of</v>

94
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

95
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:36.214
<v Speaker 1>Expound it.</v>

96
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.061
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

97
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Columbus undertook the study of astronomy,</v>

98
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.563
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>

99
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and celestial navigation.</v>

100
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>In 1478,</v>

101
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>he set off for the three key Atlantic Archipelagos.</v>

102
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>The first islands greet visitors were the Azores,</v>

103
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 1>800 miles west of Portugal.</v>

104
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>The other two were the Madeira archipelago and the Canary Islands.</v>

105
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>During these voyages,</v>

106
00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Columbus gained valuable experience on the open seat on his return to Lisbon,</v>

107
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Christopher mets,</v>

108
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and fell in love with a 25 year old woman by the name of Phillipa Munez.</v>

109
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Despite being of noble birth and with family connections to the Portuguese</v>

110
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

111
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Philipa does not come from a wealthy family.</v>

112
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>When the two were married just a few months after the courtship began,</v>

113
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>her father had no dowery to offer.</v>

114
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.970
<v Speaker 1>The newlyweds settled in the town of Porto Santo and the Madeira Islands where</v>

115
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.351
<v Speaker 1>Felipe,</v>

116
00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 1>his father had previously done the governor in 1480.</v>

117
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>A son was born and his name was diego.</v>

118
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Soon after giving birth though died.</v>

119
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>The details surrounding her demise are unclear,</v>

120
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>but most historians believe that the course was tuberculosis</v>

121
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>by the age of 30.</v>

122
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Columbus had developed a great deal of skill and experience as an</v>

123
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:46.584
<v Speaker 1>ocean voyage.</v>

124
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.070
<v Speaker 1>He had traveled as far as Iceland to the northern Ghana to the west still.</v>

125
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>He was fascinated with what lay further out the area beyond the horizon was</v>

126
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.120
<v Speaker 1>known as the Green Sea of darkness,</v>

127
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and that was much speculation about what could be found that Columbus was</v>

128
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>convinced the by sailing west,</v>

129
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>he would eventually end up in Asia.</v>

130
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>This was a novel idea and before you could test it out,</v>

131
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>he needed to gain academic support for his belief along with his brother bottle,</v>

132
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:13.311
<v Speaker 1>a mayor.</v>

133
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>He spends months pouring over geographical maps,</v>

134
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>astronomical with books and other related works.</v>

135
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>When you found anything that supported his hypothesis,</v>

136
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>he underlined this and scribbled it into his notepad.</v>

137
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.121
<v Speaker 1>Columbus.</v>

138
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>This study led to three key assumptions upon which he funded his belief.</v>

139
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.321
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

140
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.870
<v Speaker 1>there was only one ocean,</v>

141
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.601
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic,</v>

142
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and he believed it to be narrowed.</v>

143
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>His second seconds belief was that the world was relatively small and that Asia</v>

144
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>was much closer to Europe than it actually ended up being.</v>

145
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>His final assumption was that there was no large landmass between Europe and</v>

146
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Asia.</v>

147
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight,</v>

148
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>we know that Columbus was guilty of selective research.</v>

149
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Anything that didn't support his hypothesis was rejected outright.</v>

150
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>He gains much support from the writings of Marco Polo and first century</v>

151
00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>cartographer Marianas of tie.</v>

152
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>This convinced him that if he sailed u,</v>

153
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>s t would reach Asia in less than 3000 miles</v>

154
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 1>with the scientific backing,</v>

155
00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>but he needed Columbus now set out to find a backup for his plans,</v>

156
00:07:15.031 --> 00:07:18.060
<v Speaker 1>voyage of discovery more than mere financial support.</v>

157
00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:22.680
<v Speaker 1>He was after a Royal Baca who could go under him the prestige and status that he</v>

158
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:25.770
<v Speaker 1>would earn by such a perilous journey in his own words.</v>

159
00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:29.710
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be in Zionsville to call myself dawn and should be high admiral of</v>

160
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:30.181
<v Speaker 1>the ocean,</v>

161
00:07:30.181 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>sea,</v>

162
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.320
<v Speaker 1>and device.</v>

163
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Ryan,</v>

164
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.180
<v Speaker 1>governor in perpetuity of all the islands and the mainland and I discover and</v>

165
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.110
<v Speaker 1>gain all the termites thereafter be discovered and gains in the ocean sea,</v>

166
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Speaker 1>and so that's my eldest son should succeed me and his as then forth from</v>

167
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>generation to generation forever and ever in return for such honors,</v>

168
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Columbus would bestow the riches of Asia.</v>

169
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Upon these sponsoring sovereign tobacco is course he quoted from the journals of</v>

170
00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Marco Polo about the riches of the orients having lived in Portugal for the past</v>

171
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 1>eight years.</v>

172
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It was only natural that his first request was made to that country's king,</v>

173
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.730
<v Speaker 1>but despite his persuasiveness,</v>

174
00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Columbus is proposal,</v>

175
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.883
<v Speaker 1>it was rejected.</v>

176
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Speaker 1>The king viewed this unproved.</v>

177
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Sander is being vain and conceited and rather parental bragging.</v>

178
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 1>The fact that in addition to the owners,</v>

179
00:08:15.751 --> 00:08:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Columbus also demanded one 10th of all income derived did not help his course.</v>

180
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Even beyond all that,</v>

181
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.710
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of the king's advisors believed that the plans are reached.</v>

182
00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:30.711
<v Speaker 1>The Orient by sailing west was nothing more than a fool's errands with a round</v>

183
00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:32.490
<v Speaker 1>rejection from his adopted country.</v>

184
00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Columbus set his sights on the king of Spain by now the would be adventure.</v>

185
00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I was 34 years of age,</v>

186
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 1>penniless,</v>

187
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 1>widowed,</v>

188
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.230
<v Speaker 1>and with a young son to care for arriving in these Spanish port town of</v>

189
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.000
<v Speaker 1>panelists with five-year-old Diego,</v>

190
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:49.590
<v Speaker 1>and so he first attempt to find food lodging and a place for the ato to stay as</v>

191
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:51.420
<v Speaker 1>his father made his approach to the king,</v>

192
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Columbus made his way to a Franciscan monastery overlooking the pleaded poverty</v>

193
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>for the next five months.</v>

194
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>This monastery would be as base then towards the end of 1945,</v>

195
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>he made his way to court data to seek an audience with King Ferdinand and Queen</v>

196
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Isabella.</v>

197
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>He had to wait for the to return from Madrid and during this time,</v>

198
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a young woman named Beatrice on request to Herana.</v>

199
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>She began his mistress giving birth to his second son,</v>

200
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand's on August the 15th,</v>

201
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

202
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>88.</v>

203
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>The audience before the King and Queen was granted on May the first 14,</v>

204
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.843
<v Speaker 1>86.</v>

205
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Columbus and Isabella develops and immediate bonds being of the same age and</v>

206
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>clearly they were like minded still.</v>

207
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>The monarchs turn the idea over to an investigator,</v>

208
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Columbus would have to wait for five and a half frustrating years to learn of</v>

209
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>their final decision during that time.</v>

210
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He had returned to Lisbon in an attempt to reopen negotiations with the king</v>

211
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:43.850
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

212
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 1>but all to no avail.</v>

213
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 1>In the end of the Spanish commission also rejected the plan,</v>

214
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>their main reasons for doing so whether the voyage to Asia would require an</v>

215
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>absence of three years.</v>

216
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 1>This was far too long with the available technology and it's the belief that if</v>

217
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.490
<v Speaker 1>a ship did manage to get to the other side of the world,</v>

218
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>there was no way that it would be able to get back the final decision.</v>

219
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:03.601
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

220
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it was left to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.</v>

221
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>The king was happy to go along with the commission's recommendation after all he</v>

222
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 1>disliked Columbus on the personal level.</v>

223
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 1>The queen,</v>

224
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

225
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>took pains to reassure Columbus that he would be able to resubmit his plan in</v>

226
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

227
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish struggle against the most at this point had been going on for 700</v>

228
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>years and it was nearly at a conclusion when this was decided the queen and told</v>

229
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>him he would get a better reception.</v>

230
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.280
<v Speaker 1>On January the second 14,</v>

231
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.741
<v Speaker 1>92,</v>

232
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 1>the Morrish city of Granada fell to the Spanish.</v>

233
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

234
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the Royal Minister of the budget,</v>

235
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>he was friendly with Columbus and trusted about mcqueen to show favor to the</v>

236
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 1>mariners scheme.</v>

237
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>She relented in Columbus,</v>

238
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>who was down on his way back to Cordova or on the back of a mule,</v>

239
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 1>was intercepted and rushed to the royal palace to receive the good news.</v>

240
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>After waiting for five years,</v>

241
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:02.180
<v Speaker 1>it took Columbus just 10 weeks to gather together the three ships crew and the</v>

242
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:03.260
<v Speaker 1>supplies that he needed.</v>

243
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.041
<v Speaker 1>His three ships,</v>

244
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:04.191
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

245
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Nina pins are in Santa Maria,</v>

246
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>were skillfully built and according to him were well suited for the task at</v>

247
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:09.950
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

248
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Columbus gathered a group of 19 men to be split between the three ships.</v>

249
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.920
<v Speaker 1>The fleet left early morning on August the third,</v>

250
00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

251
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 1>92.</v>

252
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.210
<v Speaker 1>The first stop was the Canary Islands thousand miles to the south.</v>

253
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Then the ships were refitted and resupplied before heading out into the Green</v>

254
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Sea of darkness.</v>

255
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.290
<v Speaker 1>The ship's made good progress,</v>

256
00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:29.930
<v Speaker 1>thanks to strong easterly winds off to some days.</v>

257
00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 1>They entered into an area known as the Saragossa Sea.</v>

258
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.750
<v Speaker 1>All around the waters were filled with Gulf.</v>

259
00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>We're to thick green plants that are floated on the surface at the same time as</v>

260
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:40.191
<v Speaker 1>this was happening,</v>

261
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:42.380
<v Speaker 1>the wind's died down to almost nothing.</v>

262
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.580
<v Speaker 1>After three weeks at sea,</v>

263
00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the cre begins aside,</v>

264
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 1>land nesting birds.</v>

265
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

266
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.960
<v Speaker 1>There was no citing of lands.</v>

267
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.010
<v Speaker 1>As the weeks passed,</v>

268
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:50.780
<v Speaker 1>with no indications of Terra Firma,</v>

269
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 1>the creek became increasingly agitated onboard the Santa Maria.</v>

270
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 1>They were using close to musiny.</v>

271
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>We things coming to a boiling point is Columbus made an ultimate declaration on</v>

272
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>October the 10th.</v>

273
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>If land was not cited in three days,</v>

274
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.740
<v Speaker 1>he promised that he would turn back two days later.</v>

275
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 1>The long awaited word came at 2:00 AM on the twelfth,</v>

276
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the cry of Tara,</v>

277
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Tara resounded from ship to ship.</v>

278
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Ninety pairs of eyes strained to see the islands that was six miles in the</v>

279
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:16.654
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

280
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Columbus promised that the first man to site land would receive a yearly</v>

281
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 1>pension,</v>

282
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>have a thousand married aviators for the rest of his life.</v>

283
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

284
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>That's and to say the name is Rodrigo ever received this reward.</v>

285
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Columbus claims do have seen a line to the evening before and gave himself the</v>

286
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>reward that come across in Ireland,</v>

287
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.090
<v Speaker 1>situated in the middle of the Caribbean.</v>

288
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Seed it was populated by are like Indians.</v>

289
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 1>These were a friendly people and some of them swung out to meet the new</v>

290
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

291
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>These people lived in village communes and to develops an agricultural economy.</v>

292
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 1>They have no iron implements,</v>

293
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 1>but Columbus was quick to notice that they wore tiny pieces of goals in memory</v>

294
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>is Columbus,</v>

295
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>was determined to get to the source of the Arawaks gold.</v>

296
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>He at some of the natives of borders ships and then took them as prisoners.</v>

297
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 1>He demanded that they guide into the place why the gold was located not having</v>

298
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 1>success in sales to modern day Cuba,</v>

299
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and then to Hispaniola it was that,</v>

300
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>that his visions of a vast gold empire.</v>

301
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:11.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

302
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:12.154
<v Speaker 1>rekindles,</v>

303
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>when a local chief presented him with a gold mask,</v>

304
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Columbus and his men build a force on the island of Hispaniola.</v>

305
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Naming is another dad.</v>

306
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.813
<v Speaker 1>Christmas.</v>

307
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.850
<v Speaker 1>He left 39 men that with strict orders to find the gold.</v>

308
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.420
<v Speaker 1>He then took more prisoners and began for the return journey to Spain before</v>

309
00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:36.470
<v Speaker 1>leaving his men killed two natives who refuse to trade as many bows and arrows</v>

310
00:13:36.471 --> 00:13:38.000
<v Speaker 1>as they demand is on the return.</v>

311
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.361
<v Speaker 1>Jenny,</v>

312
00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:41.030
<v Speaker 1>some of the prisoners died from exposure to cold weather.</v>

313
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.260
<v Speaker 1>What is the return to Spain?</v>

314
00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Columbus made extravagant claims about what he had encountered.</v>

315
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.280
<v Speaker 1>He stated that he had reached Asia when in fact he had landed on Cuba.</v>

316
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.690
<v Speaker 1>He also spoke of rivers flowing with golden's and abundance of spices.</v>

317
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.050
<v Speaker 1>He promised that with a little more financial help from the king and Queen,</v>

318
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.670
<v Speaker 1>you could go back and pick up as much gold as they needed and as many slaves as</v>

319
00:14:01.671 --> 00:14:02.504
<v Speaker 1>they need it to.</v>

320
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.850
<v Speaker 1>The king and queen were suitably and damage.</v>

321
00:14:04.851 --> 00:14:09.170
<v Speaker 1>The second voyage was made up of 17 ships in more than 1,200 men.</v>

322
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the first trip had been focused on reaching Asia.</v>

323
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Now the objective was twofold,</v>

324
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.730
<v Speaker 1>slaves and gold from islands,</v>

325
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.211
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

326
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:21.280
<v Speaker 1>They raged taking prisoners and demanding that they be led to the goals as word</v>

327
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.760
<v Speaker 1>spreads of the impending danger.</v>

328
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Villages were evacuated and the sailors who had been left at Nafa dabs were</v>

329
00:14:26.691 --> 00:14:28.550
<v Speaker 1>executed with no goal to be found.</v>

330
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Columbus embarked upon a massive slave drive,</v>

331
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.420
<v Speaker 1>$1,500,</v>

332
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.051
<v Speaker 1>proac men,</v>

333
00:14:33.051 --> 00:14:37.730
<v Speaker 1>women and children with thrown into pens and from them 500 of the best specimens</v>

334
00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 1>were chosen to be taken to Spain.</v>

335
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.420
<v Speaker 1>200 of these died on the way back with the remainder being sold at auction.</v>

336
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Still Columbus was desperate to get his hands on the goals in Haiti.</v>

337
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>He ordered that every person aged 14 or over was to collect a minimum quota of</v>

338
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Speaker 1>goals every three months.</v>

339
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Those that succeeded were given a capa necklace to app.</v>

340
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Anyone without the nexus would have to hand cut off.</v>

341
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 1>The reality was though there was hardly any gold to be hands apart from small</v>

342
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>amounts that can be found in streams.</v>

343
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 1>The results of Columbus as gold obsession was that in two years,</v>

344
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:14.441
<v Speaker 1>the black population was cut in half with a hundred and 25,000 people being</v>

345
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>

346
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>starve to death,</v>

347
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.380
<v Speaker 1>or committing suicide.</v>

348
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Columbus established his base on Hispaniola and named himself governor of the</v>

349
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>

350
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.950
<v Speaker 1>The situation quickly devolved into chaos,</v>

351
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 1>though most of the Europeans on the islands were seconds.</v>

352
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Many of them were ex convicts.</v>

353
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 1>They occupied themselves by raping the native women and terrorizing the men and</v>

354
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

355
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Looting was rampant and the quantity of goals gathered was pitiful compared to</v>

356
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>what Columbus promised.</v>

357
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 1>In October of $14,</v>

358
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:41.331
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>

359
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 1>a royal inspector arrived on Hispaniola in the wake of worrying reports that had</v>

360
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>reached the Spanish court.</v>

361
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 1>The inspector soon gathered plenty of evidence to indicate Columbus,</v>

362
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 1>giving him no choice but to return to Spain in order to defend himself before</v>

363
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the king and queen</v>

364
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 1>setting sail on the Nina,</v>

365
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 1>the 45 year old Columbus arrived back in Portugal.</v>

366
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 1>On June the 11th,</v>

367
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.920
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

368
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 1>46.</v>

369
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>He clothed himself in a fry's robe as a sign of Penitence and set out to meet</v>

370
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 1>the solver writtens that Vegas,</v>

371
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>which was some 500 miles from his landing port or meeting the King Queen.</v>

372
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.900
<v Speaker 1>He immediately reassured them there was still plenty of gold to be hats.</v>

373
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.680
<v Speaker 1>He also tried to convince them that he had reached the Malay Peninsula of</v>

374
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asia as a final enticements.</v>

375
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>He told them on x that he was convinced that there was a whole new continent</v>

376
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 1>lying just to the south of the islands that he had landed on.</v>

377
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 1>To his surprise and great pleasure.</v>

378
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.570
<v Speaker 1>The king and queen were willing to overlook the bad reports.</v>

379
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Dad received further.</v>

380
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to finance another voyage specifically to confirm the existence of</v>

381
00:16:44.331 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 1>this new continents.</v>

382
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.010
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

383
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Columbus would have to wait a further two years before adventuring again.</v>

384
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>This time the sufferns insisted that he take with him colonists rather than</v>

385
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

386
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 1>The third voyage therefore included 30 women,</v>

387
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.913
<v Speaker 1>50 farmers,</v>

388
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.880
<v Speaker 1>20 mechanics,</v>

389
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:01.850
<v Speaker 1>and 10 gardeners along with 30 sailors.</v>

390
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>The fleet consisted of six ships,</v>

391
00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 1>which Columbus splits into two separate commands.</v>

392
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.350
<v Speaker 1>The first three ships had to Hispaniola with suppliers for the colony that was</v>

393
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:09.801
<v Speaker 1>located,</v>

394
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:13.640
<v Speaker 1>that the reigning ships made onfi discovery fleet with Columbus at the helm.</v>

395
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>They took a southerly routes to the indies and such have any lands lying south</v>

396
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>of the Antilles.</v>

397
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Throughout this voyage,</v>

398
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Columbus suffered from terrible pains,</v>

399
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:21.651
<v Speaker 1>gout,</v>

400
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 1>as well as fever.</v>

401
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Land was first sighted on July the 31st 14,</v>

402
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:25.521
<v Speaker 1>98,</v>

403
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>and the fleet soon made in Trinidad for the next two weeks.</v>

404
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.860
<v Speaker 1>They explored the area between Trinidad and the South American mainland sailing</v>

405
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.501
<v Speaker 1>further west,</v>

406
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:34.580
<v Speaker 1>they sold lands again,</v>

407
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and it was at this point the Columbus declared they had found the new continent</v>

408
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.540
<v Speaker 1>having achieved his objective.</v>

409
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Columbus set the fleet North Hispaniola.</v>

410
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:48.720
<v Speaker 1>When he arrived,</v>

411
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:50.430
<v Speaker 1>he found place in the state of rebellion.</v>

412
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.061
<v Speaker 1>While he was gone,</v>

413
00:17:51.061 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 1>many of his men had died mainly from starvation.</v>

414
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 1>While those who survived were disgusted at the harsh treatments that had been</v>

415
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:59.690
<v Speaker 1>subjected to under the nominal rulership of Columbus's.</v>

416
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Brother Bartholomew Bartholomew was the acting governor while Columbus,</v>

417
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 1>who's away.</v>

418
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 1>The rebels were led by a man named Roden gathering both standards and natives to</v>

419
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:08.781
<v Speaker 1>his cause.</v>

420
00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:11.700
<v Speaker 1>He set about the process of overthrowing the franchise governments.</v>

421
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>This Columbus had established after a period of fierce fighting the exhausted</v>

422
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:16.321
<v Speaker 1>and physically ill,</v>

423
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 1>columbus and treated with Roldan for peace terms Columbus gave in to all of</v>

424
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Roland's demands,</v>

425
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>including appointing him as mayor in giving land grants to every standard who</v>

426
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:28.560
<v Speaker 1>wished to stay on the islands with this humiliating defeat.</v>

427
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Columbus is only designed now,</v>

428
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.643
<v Speaker 1>was to leave.</v>

429
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

430
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>news of the latest rebellion had made his way to Spain.</v>

431
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 1>The king had sent a man by the name of Francisco Dibaba dealer.</v>

432
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.200
<v Speaker 1>They seven of the crown and a night.</v>

433
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 1>His mission was to sort the entire situation out.</v>

434
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>He arrived in Hispaniola to discover that a mass execution of the rebels was</v>

435
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:48.990
<v Speaker 1>underway just playing his rod loaders.</v>

436
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 1>You put a halt to the proceedings in town,</v>

437
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.031
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>

438
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:53.550
<v Speaker 1>and just to your brothers thrown into ions.</v>

439
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.740
<v Speaker 1>The three brothers were shipped back to Spain.</v>

440
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.120
<v Speaker 1>When the people there saw the greater columbus in chains after the ship darker,</v>

441
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.300
<v Speaker 1>they became angry.</v>

442
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Hearing of this popular reaction,</v>

443
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.510
<v Speaker 1>the king ordered that they'd be freed.</v>

444
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Columbus has reunion with the king and Queen was an emotionally charged a fap.</v>

445
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.670
<v Speaker 1>He threw himself at the queen's feats and through solves Kista hands and feets.</v>

446
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.440
<v Speaker 1>He pleaded innocent saying this,</v>

447
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.790
<v Speaker 1>any wrongs he had committed,</v>

448
00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:22.670
<v Speaker 1>whether the result of ignorance and not wickedness.</v>

449
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.880
<v Speaker 1>This O'Brien's took pity on him and his promise to restore his wealth and</v>

450
00:19:25.881 --> 00:19:26.570
<v Speaker 1>titles.</v>

451
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.901
<v Speaker 1>The king,</v>

452
00:19:26.901 --> 00:19:27.300
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

453
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.420
<v Speaker 1>was convinced that while he may be superior at see,</v>

454
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Columbus was no governor of men on lance still his skills as a voyager where an</v>

455
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.420
<v Speaker 1>asset that could be further utilized and as a result,</v>

456
00:19:38.421 --> 00:19:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand authorized a fourth voyage to the West indies in the hopes of finding</v>

457
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.630
<v Speaker 1>a direct route to Asia.</v>

458
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.260
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

459
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 1>he was ordered to stay well away from Hispaniola.</v>

460
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>This time it was strictly a voyage of discovery.</v>

461
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Columbus set forth on this final voyage on May the nine slash 15 slash two is</v>

462
00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:56.480
<v Speaker 1>fleet reached the West indies.</v>

463
00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:57.440
<v Speaker 1>In 21 days,</v>

464
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.303
<v Speaker 1>two weeks later,</v>

465
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.730
<v Speaker 1>his three ships encountered a terrible storm which they managed to see through</v>

466
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.320
<v Speaker 1>with no loss of life.</v>

467
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 1>The fleet eventually reached the offshore islands of Banana,</v>

468
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.970
<v Speaker 1>a few miles from Honduras,</v>

469
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.461
<v Speaker 1>from them,</v>

470
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:11.690
<v Speaker 1>they encountered terrible see conditions for 38 straight days,</v>

471
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.840
<v Speaker 1>which tested the men to the absolute limits.</v>

472
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.321
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

473
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:17.450
<v Speaker 1>they found their way to the Panamanian coastline.</v>

474
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Here they were heartened to find goals in abundance.</v>

475
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 1>They spend the next several months traveling up and down the coast,</v>

476
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.103
<v Speaker 1>gathering gold,</v>

477
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.630
<v Speaker 1>and then they headed back for Hispaniola,</v>

478
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.850
<v Speaker 1>but the weather beaten and he's in ships.</v>

479
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.610
<v Speaker 1>They never reached Hispaniola with the ship's taking on water.</v>

480
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.770
<v Speaker 1>They barely limps into Jamaica.</v>

481
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 1>The ships went now,</v>

482
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.660
<v Speaker 1>useless in the party,</v>

483
00:20:35.661 --> 00:20:37.580
<v Speaker 1>remained stranded for only a year.</v>

484
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I need to be rescued.</v>

485
00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:40.820
<v Speaker 1>When two ships arrived from Santa Domingo,</v>

486
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Columbus and his men were taken to Hispaniola to recover from that ordeal,</v>

487
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 1>but the former governor knew that he was not there.</v>

488
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he could manage it,</v>

489
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 1>he found a passage on a ship bound for Spain and arrived back on November the</v>

490
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:53.430
<v Speaker 1>seventh,</v>

491
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

492
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

493
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.793
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

494
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Columbus returned to Spain,</v>

495
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:01.850
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>

496
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.420
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>

497
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.253
<v Speaker 1>and distance.</v>

498
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.410
<v Speaker 1>He was so ill that he could hardly stand on his own power.</v>

499
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.010
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

500
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.210
<v Speaker 1>he still had the stamina to demands an accounting of as accumulated possessions,</v>

501
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.540
<v Speaker 1>your agreements that he had made years ago with Ferdinand and Isabella for a</v>

502
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>10th of all bouncy.</v>

503
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd made him a rich man and now sort the claimants.</v>

504
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.161
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

505
00:21:19.161 --> 00:21:22.010
<v Speaker 1>gold was shipped to him and he was given land in Hispaniola.</v>

506
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.953
<v Speaker 1>Got The wealth.</v>

507
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 1>It came too late for Columbus to enjoy it in May of 15.</v>

508
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

509
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.931
<v Speaker 1>six is bad.</v>

510
00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Health deteriorated.</v>

511
00:21:27.981 --> 00:21:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Fatally.</v>

512
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.920
<v Speaker 1>He became bedridden and on May the 19th,</v>

513
00:21:30.921 --> 00:21:33.230
<v Speaker 1>the priest was called to administer the last rites.</v>

514
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 1>He died the next day.</v>

515
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Moments after whispering in your hands,</v>
