1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.900
<v Speaker 1>To some,</v>

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>he was the very embodiment of evil,</v>

3
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the psychopathic incarnation of the devil himself.</v>

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.051
<v Speaker 1>To others,</v>

5
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>he was a god fearing defender of the faith,</v>

6
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>courageously standing up to the feared Ottoman Empire in his time,</v>

7
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>he was known as Vlad the impaler thanks to his favorite method of executing</v>

8
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>people today,</v>

9
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>though we remember him as the real life inspiration for bram stoker's infamous</v>

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>prince of darkness.</v>

11
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

12
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>we discover the gruesome truth about the real flat Dracula,</v>

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Vlad Dracula future prints of where they here was born in either November or</v>

14
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>December of 14,</v>

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>31 in the northern Romanian state.</v>

16
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>If we lay here,</v>

17
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>his father flap.</v>

18
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>The second was to become ruler of flakier.</v>

19
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>In the year of his second son's birth,</v>

20
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Vlad senior joined in 90 society known as the order of the dragons.</v>

21
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Upon his induction,</v>

22
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>he was given the surname draggle,</v>

23
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>which is a derivative of Drac,</v>

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>meaning dragon in ancient Romanian.</v>

25
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.781
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

26
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>in the modern Romanian language,</v>

27
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>this means devil.</v>

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>His son was given the name for some of that being dracula,</v>

29
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>the world of land was born into.</v>

30
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>It was a violent one,</v>

31
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>consumed with disputes over territory and rulership,</v>

32
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>family name and Ana were the most important thing,</v>

33
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>something which was drummed into the boy from the start.</v>

34
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>He also understood that the goal was to push the boundaries of the empire</v>

35
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the cost,</v>

36
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>the order of the Dragon,</v>

37
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>which Vlad scene he became a part of,</v>

38
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>was committed to defending Christianity against the haters.</v>

39
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman Turks at the time of his son's birth,</v>

40
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.641
<v Speaker 1>Vad.</v>

41
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 1>The second served as a guard commander in the mountain passes and we're like</v>

42
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

43
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>we don't actually know who've lads,</v>

44
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>mother was when Vlad was born.</v>

45
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>His father was married to princess and nature,</v>

46
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>but he also had a string of mistresses and anyone could have given birth to the</v>

47
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

48
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Dracula lands formative years were spent in ct,</v>

49
00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>so IRA,</v>

50
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>when his father ascended to the throne of weather here in 1436,</v>

51
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>he brought Vlad and his younger brother Ragu to live in the royal court in the</v>

52
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

53
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.281
<v Speaker 1>The boys.</v>

54
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It would have been educated at home by Greek and Roman scholars who their father</v>

55
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>had brought in from Constantinople.</v>

56
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They would have busied themselves with learning the rudiments of mathematics,</v>

57
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>

58
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.521
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

59
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and languages including old church,</v>

60
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>slavonic,</v>

61
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>

62
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.073
<v Speaker 1>and Latin,</v>

63
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>that's their privileged upbringing,</v>

64
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>was rudely interrupted when their father was ousted as real of a rival group who</v>

65
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>were in league with the Hungarians.</v>

66
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Glad senior built an alliance with the Ottoman Sea,</v>

67
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>agreed to help him regain his throne on the proviso that he paid tribute to</v>

68
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Sultan macramed the seconds and so that he leave his two sons at the Ottoman</v>

69
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>court as a guarantee of his loyalty labs had no choice and the two boys were</v>

70
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>seized and made prisoners,</v>

71
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>although relatively well treated,</v>

72
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the boys were able to observe the Turkish use of Taran as an instrument in order</v>

73
00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>to achieve ends.</v>

74
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>This was something which Vlad would use to great effect nature in his own life</v>

75
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>while in the Ottoman court.</v>

76
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>So the boys were able to further their education being instructed in logic,</v>

77
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the Turkish language and the teachings of the Koran.</v>

78
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.000
<v Speaker 1>They were also given lessons in horsemanship and warfare.</v>

79
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>The two brothers differ markedly and their attitude towards their captivity.</v>

80
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.551
<v Speaker 1>Roger,</v>

81
00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>either younger brother,</v>

82
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>he accepted the situation and embraced his new life and the teachings that came</v>

83
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

84
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>it would eventually converted Islam and to service in the Ottoman court.</v>

85
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Vlad,</v>

86
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

87
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>resistant as every turn,</v>

88
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>despite constant punishments for is certainly attitudes with the assistance of</v>

89
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>the Turks.</v>

90
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Lads senior was able to regain his throne,</v>

91
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>but this wasn't something that lasted in 14.</v>

92
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 1>40 seven Hungarian backs,</v>

93
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>rebels attacked again,</v>

94
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>forcing Vlad and his oldest son Messier the second to fleet both were eventually</v>

95
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>captured and put to death.</v>

96
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>The next in line to the throne of winter here was vlad the third,</v>

97
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>his older brother,</v>

98
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>but he had become a monk and lived in a monastery.</v>

99
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>This left Vlad who is now 16 as the rightful heir to the throne.</v>

100
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Despite his obstinate and see the Turks had grown fond of the teenager.</v>

101
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>They vowed to help him regain his throne,</v>

102
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>which they did with an overthrow of the rebel ruler in 1448.</v>

103
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the Ottomans left,</v>

104
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

105
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.140
<v Speaker 1>the Hungarians were back and within two months flat was forced to flee to</v>

106
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Moldova for the next three years.</v>

107
00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:30.530
<v Speaker 1>He lived there under the protection and tutelage of his uncle Prince Bogdan the</v>

108
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>

109
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.650
<v Speaker 1>but when Bogdan was assassinated in 1450,</v>

110
00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:34.670
<v Speaker 1>one flat again,</v>

111
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 1>fled this time along with his cousin print steven,</v>

112
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>the two young men ended up in Transylvania where they came onto the mentorship</v>

113
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 1>of a Hungarian warrior named John,</v>

114
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.660
<v Speaker 1>who knew Yardi.</v>

115
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>He was a power broker who was fiercely opposed to the Ottoman Empire from Yardi,</v>

116
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>had originally supported the new ruler of a man by the name of gladys.</v>

117
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Love the seconds,</v>

118
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 1>but the relationship it quickly disintegrated.</v>

119
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 1>This was thanks largely to that slavs appeasement of the Turks when Vladislav</v>

120
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.190
<v Speaker 1>invaded in several villages in Transylvania.</v>

121
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 1>When yardies patients,</v>

122
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.890
<v Speaker 1>it's simply gave out,</v>

123
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>he looks young blast to take back the throne that rightfully belonged to him.</v>

124
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.070
<v Speaker 1>In the same year,</v>

125
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.461
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

126
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:14.001
<v Speaker 1>53,</v>

127
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>the holy Roman city of Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks.</v>

128
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 1>It's now appeared as if the whole of Europe was theirs for the taking.</v>

129
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>The securing of way here became more important than ever,</v>

130
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and in 14,</v>

131
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>56 land led an army into the area.</v>

132
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.760
<v Speaker 1>He meets the army of Lattice love on the field of battle,</v>

133
00:05:31.761 --> 00:05:36.761
<v Speaker 1>ended up killing the usurper in hand to hand combat with the death of gladys.</v>

134
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.171
<v Speaker 1>Slava.</v>

135
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Vlad was restored power as the ruler of Lakeea over the next six years,</v>

136
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.670
<v Speaker 1>he would rule with an unprecedented bloodlust that would cement his name forever</v>

137
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>in the annals of merciless monarchs,</v>

138
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>having secured the throne of Lakeea for himself,</v>

139
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>God sends a portion of his army over the border to help his cousin,</v>

140
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>steven,</v>

141
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>to secure the throne of Moldova.</v>

142
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>When this was accomplished,</v>

177
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.961

180
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.990

181
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>In 1460,</v>

182

<v Speaker 1>Pope Pius the second held a congress that man to her initially calling for a new</v>

183
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:52.190

184
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>The crusade was to last for three years and will be led by Mathias Covinas.</v>

185
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>He was the son of John in Yardi,</v>

186
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 1>who had been killed during an invasion of Serbia.</v>

187
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Martinez,</v>

188
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>made a tour of European kingdoms seeking support for the enterprise.</v>

189
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>The only ruler who gave a positive response was flat.</v>

190
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Dracula overlay here determines to hold his kingdom safe from the texts.</v>

191
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 1>He formed an alliance with Mathias veinous,</v>

192
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the Ottomans,</v>

193
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile,</v>

194
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 1>well aware of the lack of support for this new crusade.</v>

195
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Sultan Mac mid the second seized the advantage by capturing the last independent</v>

196
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Serbian city smatter Rovio.</v>

197
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>During this campaign,</v>

198
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the Hungarian general.</v>

199
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Now Holly says Lagi was taken captive.</v>

200
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.660
<v Speaker 1>This general was knowns of lads having helps put down a revolt in 15,</v>

201
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>48.</v>

202
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>When Vlad heard that he had been sought in half his blood boils and he became</v>

203
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>more committed than ever to teaching the Ottomans a lesson that they would never</v>

204
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>forget.</v>

205
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate empire extended degrees in 40 slash 61 when the we grew surrendered</v>

206
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>without putting up any defense.</v>

207
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:52.761
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

208
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>both Corinth and the capital of Mr were ruled by the Turks.</v>

209
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.270
<v Speaker 1>The sultan also had his sights on here.</v>

210
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.160
<v Speaker 1>He declared it to be part of the Ottoman Empire as song she sent envoys,</v>

211
00:09:03.161 --> 00:09:08.161
<v Speaker 1>Div Lance Castle in order to collect a tribute of 10,000 buckets along with 500</v>

212
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>men to be taken into.</v>

213
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>The TAC is Shami,</v>

214
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>but the sultan had underestimated the young ruler</v>

215
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.541
<v Speaker 1>when the sultans,</v>

216
00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:19.991
<v Speaker 1>envoys,</v>

217
00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:23.200
<v Speaker 1>refused to lift that Tibetans as a sign of respect to him.</v>

218
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Vlad became enraged and times is God's drive nails through their turbans and</v>

219
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 1>into their skulls the incredible assault and responded by sending his army</v>

220
00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Speaker 1>across the Danube in order to seize the men and bring them back to become a part</v>

221
00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:36.340
<v Speaker 1>of his army.</v>

222
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Lot centers forces to the area to grab any tax that could be found.</v>

223
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 1>They will soon impaled on red hot stakes towards the end of 14,</v>

224
00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Speaker 1>61 bladder wrote to the salt and informing him that he could not afford to pay a</v>

225
00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:49.360
<v Speaker 1>tribute,</v>

226
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.360
<v Speaker 1>but that he was coming to Constantinople and was ready to negotiate.</v>

227
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Macramed was aware of of laddered already aligned himself with the crusade,</v>

228
00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.700
<v Speaker 1>so we decided to take the way he and ruler who her dad to murder his invoice by</v>

229
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:01.510
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

230
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.750
<v Speaker 1>He sent one of his generals along with a thousand strong cavalry to meet with</v>

231
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.150
<v Speaker 1>land with the intention of ambushing him,</v>

232
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but Vlad got wind of the plan that's put into operation is I an ambush as the</v>

233
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:12.460
<v Speaker 1>approaching tax.</v>

234

<v Speaker 1>We're negotiating their way through a narrow traverse that and army they</v>

235
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.320

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.190
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been reported.</v>

237
00:10:18.191 --> 00:10:22.360
<v Speaker 1>That vlans attack was one of the first instances where gun powder was used.</v>

238
00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Apparently two deadly effects.</v>

239
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.820
<v Speaker 1>The dogs work ells with many of them suffering of lance favorite torture,</v>

240
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and that was of course impalements with his blood.</v>

241
00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:30.521

<v Speaker 1>The Turks were utterly defeated with only 8,000 of them surviving these quick</v>

280
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>The Sultan had already promised the rulership of relay here to of lands younger</v>

281
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>brother Randy with himself after the head,</v>

282
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the Salton set out to find and kill flat</v>

283
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.003
<v Speaker 2>payless</v>

284
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.160
<v Speaker 1>force of around 13,000.</v>

285
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying the hugely outnumbered.</v>

286
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>They were also hopelessly out classed as far as weaponry was concerned.</v>

287
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>They carried only launces and daggers,</v>

288
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>whereas the text had in their midst squadrons of deadly arches along with</v>

289
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 1>powerful siege and muscle weaponry.</v>

290
00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Despite this Vlad was able to inflict major casualties upon the sultans forces,</v>

291
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>he followed a scorched earth policy as he moved away from the approaching.</v>

292
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Tax Wells were poisoned with entire populations,</v>

293
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 1>including animals being evacuated,</v>

294
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.240
<v Speaker 1>also engaged in guerrilla fighting tactics.</v>

295
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:13.841
<v Speaker 1>Hit and run.</v>

296
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Raids were made on the sultan's army and as a primitive type of germ warfare was</v>

297
00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>also utilized were men who were afflicted with the bubonic plague,</v>

298
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>was sent in Turkish towns,</v>

299
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>do in fact as many people as possible.</v>

300
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>The tactic works with the plague spreading to the sultans.</v>

301
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Men in the end though,</v>

302
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.820
<v Speaker 1>the efforts of lads,</v>

303
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 1>men were no more than an irritant to the vastly superior Turkish army.</v>

304
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.011
<v Speaker 1>Steadily.</v>

305
00:13:36.011 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>They moved on getting ever closer to the castle when they arrived there and does</v>

306
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.490
<v Speaker 1>24,000 men,</v>

307
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 1>strong army were holed up in the mountain refuge just outside of the city of</v>

308
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 1>that who was now faced with an encircled by the Turks,</v>

309
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 1>which would eventually forces army into starvation did something quite</v>

310
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary even for him leaving his men behind in the mountains.</v>

311
00:13:55.841 --> 00:14:00.190
<v Speaker 1>He disguised himself and walked directly into the Turkish army encampments.</v>

312
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 1>He quickly determines the position of the sultans tent.</v>

313
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 1>He founds out that the sultan had given the order for his men to remain in their</v>

314
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>tents at night in order to prevent panic in the event of an attack even quietly</v>

315
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.200
<v Speaker 1>slipped out of the camp and returned back to his own men,</v>

316
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.821
<v Speaker 1>lads,</v>

317
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and help set about planning a surprise attack on the sultan's army.</v>

318
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It was his personal intention to enter.</v>

319
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.770
<v Speaker 1>The sultans tends to drive a knife through Mac meds heart on the night of June</v>

320
00:14:24.771 --> 00:14:25.331
<v Speaker 1>the 17,</v>

321
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:25.781
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

322
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 1>62,</v>

323
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>he divided his forces into two man's then attacked from both the north and the</v>

324
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

325
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:36.040
<v Speaker 1>The Turks were caught off guard allowing the attackers to inflect heavy losses</v>

326
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 1>within an hour of savage fighting.</v>

327
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.020
<v Speaker 1>More than 15,000 Turks were slaughtered at a cost of some five thousands of lads</v>

328
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

329
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 1>He himself succeeded in entering the tents that he had previously picked out.</v>

330
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>The only problem was that he had selected the wrong tense and founds no salt and</v>

331
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:52.870
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>

332
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>A daybreak flags cooled off the attack and his men melted back into the</v>

333
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

334
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>The sultan was so despondent that he pulled back and was prepared to retreat all</v>

335
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the way back across the Denewb.</v>

336
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.201
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

337
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:07.550
<v Speaker 1>he was convinced by his generals that success with still within their grasp and</v>

338
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.370
<v Speaker 1>so he led his men into the capital city.</v>

339
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.700
<v Speaker 1>When they arrived in [inaudible],</v>

340
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>the tilex founds an abandoned city.</v>

341
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>They also found the remains of 20,000 Turkish soldiers killed in previous</v>

342
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:20.930
<v Speaker 1>conflicts and impaled on steaks.</v>

343
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.973
<v Speaker 1>At this site,</v>

344
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>the sultan is said to have remarked,</v>

345
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 1>a man who has done such things is worth much with nothing to do in the empty</v>

346
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:30.000
<v Speaker 1>city the sultan installed,</v>

347
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 1>do as the new ruler of delay here,</v>

348
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>and then turned and began to retrace his steps back to the denewb rather than</v>

349
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>the younger brother of labs.</v>

350
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm talking as forces and circled vlads castle and located on a cliff just</v>

351
00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:44.830
<v Speaker 1>outside of the city lands.</v>

352
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 1>First wife within the castle legend has it that she found to feed herself to the</v>

353
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:51.440
<v Speaker 1>fishes rather than full to the tax.</v>

354
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Apparently she threw herself from the walls into the river below.</v>

355
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>

356
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you set about solidifying his position.</v>

357
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:03.631
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

358
00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:07.560
<v Speaker 1>the Sultan had taken his army airway to brayleigh where the town was destroyed</v>

359
00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and hundreds were killed.</v>

360
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Vlad knew that he had to regroup and gather a larger force if he was have any</v>

361
00:16:13.231 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 1>chance of regaining control of relay.</v>

362
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Here he made his way to Hungary where he sought the help of his ally.</v>

363
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Macias Cornice Matteo's appeared to give us support,</v>

364
00:16:21.841 --> 00:16:24.360
<v Speaker 1>even making battle plans with labs.</v>

365
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:24.931
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

366
00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:27.750
<v Speaker 1>covertness had secretly turned against his old ally.</v>

367
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 1>You organized the plans,</v>

368
00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you ambush vlad.</v>

369
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.830
<v Speaker 1>The impaler was taken as this prison prisoner.</v>

370
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.430
<v Speaker 1>The reason for Matty as this change of loyalty has been debated now for</v>

371
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:40.080
<v Speaker 1>centuries with the consensus being that he wanted to become holy Roman emperor</v>

372
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and knew that an end to hostilities with the tax was needed before they can</v>

373
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:49.770
<v Speaker 1>become a reality land spent the next four years as a prisoner and hungry.</v>

374
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.611
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

375
00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:52.110
<v Speaker 1>he converted to Catholicism.</v>

376
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.850
<v Speaker 1>He also met king metastasis,</v>

377
00:16:53.851 --> 00:16:56.850
<v Speaker 1>cousin having softened his attitude towards this prisoner.</v>

378
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Mateus allowed the to to marry.</v>

379
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he was released just prior to the ceremony land and his new wife were</v>

380
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.481
<v Speaker 1>given a house.</v>

381
00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.140
<v Speaker 1>It passed.</v>

382
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It was under strict instructions not to return to.</v>

383
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:06.890
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

384
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

385
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.581
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

386
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:07.800
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

387
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.420
<v Speaker 1>He had no intention of giving up on the crown that still rightly belongs to him.</v>

388
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.360
<v Speaker 1>He secretly collaborations with a former military commander.</v>

389
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>They managed to gather together and Ami consisting of a mixture of Hungarian</v>

390
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Transylvanian well Adrian and Moldavia and forces of land set out with his</v>

391
00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:27.420
<v Speaker 1>makeshift Ami in the middle of 1476 by now.</v>

392
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:31.100
<v Speaker 1>His younger brother Randy would died and they had been replaced by Prince busop.</v>

393
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:35.370
<v Speaker 1>The elder before flatted even God photography shared the Saab and his army had</v>

394
00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:35.910
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>

395
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Vlad was placed on the throne and the army largely dissolved.</v>

396
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Labs was back in power,</v>

397
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.600
<v Speaker 1>but he lacked a strong army.</v>

398
00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:42.991
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

399
00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:45.180
<v Speaker 1>he only had around 4,000 men to draw upon,</v>

400
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.960
<v Speaker 1>so when the tax returns two months after his retaking of the throne,</v>

401
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>he was soundly defeated.</v>

402
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>The exact details surrounding his death are a master of some debates.</v>

403
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Most scholars agree that he was killed while fighting the techs in early 14,</v>

404
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 1>77,</v>

405
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>a contemporary Turkish chronicle a recorded that the tax killed and decapitated</v>

406
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

407
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.870
<v Speaker 1>sending his head back to Constantinople.</v>

408
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:13.651
<v Speaker 1>There it is,</v>

409
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 1>said to have been presented in honey and to put on display so that everyone</v>

410
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 1>could see that the graduate impaler was really finally debt.</v>

411
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 1>It is estimated that Vlans,</v>

412
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>legacy of execution methods included more than 20,000 impalements,</v>

413
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 1>5,000 beheadings,</v>

414
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.710
<v Speaker 1>10,000 burnings at stake,</v>

415
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.501
<v Speaker 1>tend to x.</v>

416
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You had nails driven through that turbans and at least one who was boiled alive</v>

417
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.100
<v Speaker 1>and then cannibalized,</v>
