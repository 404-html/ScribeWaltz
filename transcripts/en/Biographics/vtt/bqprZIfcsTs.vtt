<v Speaker 1>Just before we get started with today's video,</v>

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank of brilliant for sponsoring it to support biographics and to</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's also a link in the description below.</v>

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of years ago,</v>

7
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>if you told someone that one's a human beings would fly through the air that</v>

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.230
<v Speaker 1>assume you were talking about witchcraft,</v>

9
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>and yet in 1904 the Wright brothers flew the first successful airplane.</v>

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>One decade later in 1914 Jack Parsons was born.</v>

11
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>While most boys of his generation was still fascinated by airplanes,</v>

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Parsons was already two steps ahead.</v>

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>He dreamed about building the first rocket ship that would take men to the moon.</v>

14
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

15
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.291
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

16
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:40.781
<v Speaker 1>this idea,</v>

17
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>it was considered a total fantasy and the 1920s and thirties characters like</v>

18
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>buck Rogers popularize the idea that humans could explore the expanses of space,</v>

19
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>but it was purely science fiction.</v>

20
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Flying an airplane is one thing,</v>

21
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but no man could truly go to the moon and less they had magic powers.</v>

22
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Scientists and engineers from around the world said that the math,</v>

23
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>it's simply didn't add up and that mankind would never make it out of the</v>

24
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.244
<v Speaker 1>stratosphere.</v>

25
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>For Jeremy Parsons and the opinions of all these experts didn't stop him from</v>

26
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>trying to make this dream a reality.</v>

27
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>He studied the chemistry necessary to create a liquid rocket fuel that was in</v>

28
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>fact strong enough to defy gravity and for good measure,</v>

29
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>he practiced a bit of magic.</v>

30
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

31
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Magic is work would become the basis of NASA as modern day space program,</v>

32
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but his legacy was tarnished by his involvement with the occult.</v>

33
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Instead of being in the limelight of history,</v>

34
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>the memory of his accomplishments was pushed aside for years.</v>

35
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of the original rocket man,</v>

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons,</v>

37
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons parents' roof,</v>

38
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Whiteside and Marvel Parsons were originally from wealthy families and</v>

39
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>

40
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 1>They moved to Los Angeles together in the early 19 hundreds in 1914 they gave</v>

41
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>birth to the subject of today's video,</v>

42
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>marvel Whiteside Parsons when he was very young,</v>

43
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>his parents got a divorce and Ruth Whiteside called her son Jack.</v>

44
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Instead.</v>

45
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.051
<v Speaker 1>Roof,</v>

46
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>purchased a house on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena,</v>

47
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:19.621
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

48
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>which has the nickname of millionaire male because the streets are lined with</v>

49
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>mansions.</v>

50
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Parsons was a bookworm and he enjoyed reading Psyfari and instead of playing</v>

51
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>outside and making friends,</v>

52
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>he was so fascinated by stories of magic that he wants trying to summon the</v>

53
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>devil in his own bedroom.</v>

54
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Parsons wanted to grow up to build a rocket ship so badly he was willing to do</v>

55
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>whatever it took even selling his soul to Satan.</v>

56
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens,</v>

57
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>of course in z later call this experience a magical fiasco and he never</v>

58
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>attempted to do it again in junior high.</v>

59
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>He did badly in school even though he had a bright minds growing up without a</v>

60
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>father Parsons,</v>

61
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>he was awkward around other boys and many people considered him to be a feminist</v>

62
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>and other boy in his class.</v>

63
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Edward Form in was also bullied for reading science fiction books.</v>

64
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>The two became close friends and shared the dream of one day going into space</v>

65
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>when they were in high school,</v>

66
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>they experimented with fireworks and homemade rockets in the Parsons is</v>

67
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>backyards.</v>

68
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>He was always trying to figure out methods to make the rockets go higher into</v>

69
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

70
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>The backyard was full of large craters made from all of these attempts.</v>

71
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

72
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>he was so hyper focused on this goal that is grades.</v>

73
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>They continued to plumbers Jack Parsons,</v>

74
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>his mother,</v>

75
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>she sent him to a boarding school called the Brown military academy and the</v>

76
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>hopes that this would straighten them out,</v>

77
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work.</v>

78
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>He was expelled for blowing up on if the dormitory toilets,</v>

79
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Ruth wide sites father,</v>

80
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>they'd been supporting that lavish lifestyle.</v>

81
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So when he passed away in 1931 the answer move to a much smaller house.</v>

82
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Parsons was attending college to study physics and chemistry at the time,</v>

83
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>but he had to drop out because his family,</v>

84
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>he could no longer afford the tuition.</v>

85
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>The chemistry classes he took in school were enough for him to find a job as a</v>

86
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>chemist at the Hercules powder company,</v>

87
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>which specialized in creating gunpowder.</v>

88
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>He owns $100 a month,</v>

89
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>which is more like $1,760 a month after modern inflation,</v>

90
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>and he was also learning much needed information about explosive chemicals.</v>

91
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>He married Alan Northrop in 1935 when he was 21 years old.</v>

92
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>He tried to save up money for tuition so that he could transfer his credits to</v>

93
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Stanford University and it was simply too expensive.</v>

94
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.771
<v Speaker 1>Jack Carlson,</v>

95
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.650
<v Speaker 1>and he was still really close with that childhood friend.</v>

96
00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:34.940
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned Edward Foreman.</v>

97
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.750
<v Speaker 1>He ends ads,</v>

98
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.870
<v Speaker 1>attended public lectures at local universities to learn from some of the</v>

99
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.210
<v Speaker 1>greatest minds in the aeronautics industry.</v>

100
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's a caltech students named Frank Molina,</v>

101
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 1>who introduced them to his thesis advisor,</v>

102
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Theodore von Karman.</v>

103
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>He allowed them to have access to the Guggenheim aeronautical,</v>

104
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.053
<v Speaker 1>the Barra tree,</v>

105
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.430
<v Speaker 1>which had been abandoned after the Great Depression.</v>

106
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Once they had access to the state of the art equipment,</v>

107
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 1>they gathered a team of other graduate students at Caltech to help them build</v>

108
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>our rocket engine.</v>

109
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.421
<v Speaker 1>As they,</v>

110
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>their experiments got bigger and bigger.</v>

111
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.410
<v Speaker 1>They had to move out into the desert to an area known as the devil's dam in</v>

112
00:05:09.411 --> 00:05:10.244
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena.</v>

113
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Their official name was,</v>

114
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:12.290
<v Speaker 1>the Gal said,</v>

115
00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 1>rocket research projects.</v>

116
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.080
<v Speaker 1>All the rounds campus,</v>

117
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.390
<v Speaker 1>they under the nickname the suicide squad.</v>

118
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>

119
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.860
<v Speaker 1>near death experiences experimenting with explosives.</v>

120
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>They succeeded in building a rocket fueled,</v>

121
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 1>assisted take off rockets called Jato.</v>

122
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.721
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

123
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:29.780
<v Speaker 1>the United States staff falls took notice in this rock attention.</v>

124
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.770
<v Speaker 1>The government hired Jack Parsons and does friends in order to create the jet</v>

125
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>propulsion laboratory or JPL.</v>

126
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.831
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>

127
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:39.680
<v Speaker 1>this same laboratory would become the foundation of NASA.</v>

128
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Possums made so much money at all of this that he was able to buy a mansion in</v>

129
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Pasadena,</v>

130
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.650
<v Speaker 1>which he named the parsonage.</v>

131
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.063
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

132
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>By Day Jack Parsons.</v>

133
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:58.890
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to be a man of science and logic that all did.</v>

134
00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>His friends and family know that he was leading a double life costing magic</v>

135
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:03.621
<v Speaker 1>spells at night,</v>

136
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and the hopes that the universe would help his dreams come true.</v>

137
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.693
<v Speaker 1>He met the magician,</v>

138
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Alistair Crowley,</v>

139
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and became deeply involved with the occult.</v>

140
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>They believed in a belief system called [inaudible] Lima.</v>

141
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>The mantra was do what thou wells,</v>

142
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 1>which was a way of manifesting their wants and desires into existence.</v>

143
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Unless Crowley had grown up in a strict Quaker household where his parents</v>

144
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>raised him to read the Bible on a daily basis.</v>

145
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.541
<v Speaker 1>Later in life,</v>

146
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>he was able to attend to Cambridge University where it became evidence that he</v>

147
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>had a genius level Iq.</v>

148
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.880
<v Speaker 1>He wholly rejected the teachings of the Bible and focused instead on secularism.</v>

149
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

150
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>anything against Christianity was interpreted as being demonic.</v>

151
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Crowley fully embraced this as part of his identity,</v>

152
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>calling himself the beast and attempting to summon powerful demons to come to</v>

153
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>his aid.</v>

154
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>From the time Jack Parsons was experimenting with rockets in his backyard as a</v>

155
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

156
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 1>the idea that man could actually go into space was still a fantasy.</v>

157
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Many people refuse to believe that it could one day be real and while it's hard</v>

158
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>for us to imagine now the mere suggestion that man could reach the moon was</v>

159
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>considered to be rather simple.</v>

160
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.731
<v Speaker 1>While fell.</v>

161
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Oma has plenty of spooky and paranormal elements to their religion.</v>

162
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Their core belief system was actually not too far away from many new age beliefs</v>

163
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>and modern day publications like the secret which calls the concept of the law</v>

164
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>of attraction practitioners of the Lima did they in fact believe in magic,</v>

165
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't just card tricks and parlor games.</v>

166
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>They practiced sex magic,</v>

167
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what it sounds like.</v>

168
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 1>They believe that the intense feeling people have while having an orgasm opens</v>

169
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>the gate to the universe.</v>

170
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>They believed that in that small window of opportunity,</v>

171
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it is possible for a human being to perform a magic spell.</v>

172
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>they really needed to do to perform.</v>

174
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>This spell was to focus on their intention while having sex and then wish would</v>

175
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>come true because it was put out into the universe.</v>

176
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons became the leader of his own group and they would have huge sex</v>

177
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>magic orgies and his mansion in Pasadena.</v>

178
00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly,</v>

179
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:00.291
<v Speaker 1>Parsons,</v>

180
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>his wife did not enjoy this sort of lifestyle,</v>

181
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>so she left him.</v>

182
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>He began to have an affair with his wife's sister,</v>

183
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Northrop Hollister.</v>

184
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>We believed very strongly in the occult,</v>

185
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>unlike her sister.</v>

186
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>She actually enjoyed participating in these orgies and Jack Parsons was just one</v>

187
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>of many men in the group that she would practice sex magic with.</v>

188
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>While it may not surprise anyone,</v>

189
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Alistair Crowley was addicted to Saxons,</v>

190
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 1>multiple orgasms in one day.</v>

191
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer enough to satisfy him.</v>

192
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>He experimented with drugs and he eventually became addicted to heroin,</v>

193
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 1>which was his downfall.</v>

194
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>As one of Jack Parsons meetings,</v>

195
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>he and Sarah Hollister mad say,</v>

196
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>science fiction writer named l Ron Hubbard.</v>

197
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 1>If that name sounds familiar to you,</v>

198
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>it's because Howard would go on to found the cult of Scientology,</v>

199
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.260
<v Speaker 1>but at this time he was one of the very few saifai writers who were writing in</v>

200
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 1>such detail about the possibility of sending humans into space.</v>

201
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>As a hardcore Scifi nerd,</v>

202
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons was thrilled to meet l Ron Hubbard and invited him to join in on</v>

203
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>their parties as much as he wants it.</v>

204
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Parsons believed that he could summon a goddess named Babylon.</v>

205
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>She has described as being the great mother of the earth and a symbol of</v>

206
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>sexually liberated women.</v>

207
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>He asked his followers do participate in a project called the Babylon working.</v>

208
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>He thought through all of these sex magic rituals,</v>

209
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the scarlet woman would come along to give birth to the moon child.</v>

210
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>They believed that this child could be raised to aspire to travel to space</v>

211
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>instead of holding onto the comforts of bath if they never actually gave birth</v>

212
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>to a real baby because they hoped that this would be more of a symbolic gesture</v>

213
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 1>for future generations of mankind's.</v>

214
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 1>A scarlet woman was a symbol of free love throughout the world so people could</v>

215
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>have sex outside of marriage more openly.</v>

216
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.111
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>

217
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>you could actually say that this spell actually worked just a few years later.</v>

218
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 1>The United States entered the space race in the entire world's turned on their</v>

219
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>televisions to watch the first steps onto the moon in the 1960s the hippies then</v>

220
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>spread the free love movement that Parsons had hoped for.</v>

221
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just maybe all of that sex magic actually ended up working</v>

222
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.610
<v Speaker 1>after discovering his ties to the occult in the late Forties Jack Parsons was</v>

223
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.890
<v Speaker 1>fired from his job at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</v>

224
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Since he was down on his luck.</v>

225
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>L Ron Hubbard asked Jack Parsons if he would be interested in partnering in a</v>

226
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Boot Business in Florida.</v>

227
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Parsons gave hobbits $20,000 to start the business and Sarah Lester asked if she</v>

228
00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>could go to after stealing his girlfriends and robbing him,</v>

229
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:31.550
<v Speaker 1>blind Parsons realized that he'd made a terrible mistake by trusting him.</v>

230
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.301
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

231
00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:35.180
<v Speaker 1>l Ron Hubbard did create a successful boating business,</v>

232
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 1>but he never paid the money back.</v>

233
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons out to go to court to get his $20,000.</v>

234
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.581
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>

235
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:40.731
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

236
00:10:40.731 --> 00:10:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Ron Hubbard would become the founder of his own religion called Scientology and</v>

237
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 1>he used this boat business to create a sea org.</v>

238
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.830
<v Speaker 1>He borrowed much of the same principles taught by Alistair Crowley and Jack</v>

239
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Parsons about setting intentions and being the best person you can be.</v>

240
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>He also mixed in his own fictional ideas made up in his science fiction novels,</v>

241
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>even though Sarah Hollister left Jack Parsons to Mary l Ron Hubbard,</v>

242
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.550
<v Speaker 1>there were plenty of other women in the group who practically worshiped him.</v>

243
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>He mass an actress and artists named Marjorie Cameron.</v>

244
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Just like all of his other intentions.</v>

245
00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:16.340
<v Speaker 1>He had put his ideas about an elements or woman out into the universe,</v>

246
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.040
<v Speaker 1>so when he met her he believed that they were soulmates.</v>

247
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.550
<v Speaker 1>They were so intensely attracted to one another when they first met that they</v>

248
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:25.280
<v Speaker 1>spent two weeks straight making love in his bedroom.</v>

249
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 1>He married Cameron in 1946 Marjorie Cameron was more than a tad bit eccentric.</v>

250
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 1>She claims that she had visions of the coming apocalypse and she created artwork</v>

251
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 1>about how a cults beliefs that would later become popular during the beat</v>

252
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:39.824
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

253
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.180
<v Speaker 1>The 1950s was the beginning of the McCarthy era where the FBI was investigating</v>

254
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.960
<v Speaker 1>anyone under suspicion of having ties to the communist party.</v>

255
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.860
<v Speaker 1>They began to investigate Jack Parsons due to the fact that he took documents</v>

256
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 1>saying from his new employer aircraft company,</v>

257
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>they suspected that he may be supplying the USS all with these documents about</v>

258
00:11:58.541 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>rocket engines.</v>

259
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.161
<v Speaker 1>After learning,</v>

260
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>he was under investigation.</v>

261
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons voluntarily showed up at the FBI offices in Los Angeles to explain</v>

262
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that he took the documents home because he wanted to give examples of his past</v>

263
00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 1>work to apply to a job in Israel.</v>

264
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>The FBI at this point thought that he could actually be a spy for the Israeli</v>

265
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

266
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>He was fired from the Hughes Aircraft Company and this was enough to blacklist</v>

267
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>him from ever guessing another aeronautical drop again.</v>

268
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Declassified documents reveal that the FBI had been following Jack Parsons</v>

269
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 1>movements since 1948 because it is a cult ties to us to Crowley.</v>

270
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>They believe that this was a subversive group and it's considered to be</v>

271
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

272
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>They were simply waiting for a moment where he might've slept up in 1951 in</v>

273
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Parsons career was over and his marriage to Marjorie Cameron was falling apart,</v>

274
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 1>so they separated.</v>

275
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons was no longer ranking in huge paychecks.</v>

276
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 1>He occasionally works as an explosives consultants on the sets of Hollywood</v>

277
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.394
<v Speaker 1>action films,</v>

278
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but these gigs were few and far between he and to work the night shift at a gas</v>

279
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>station and he rented out the spare rooms in his house for extra income.</v>

280
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1952 Parsons received an order from a film set to create several</v>

281
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>explosives for a movie.</v>

282
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.350
<v Speaker 1>They asked him to hurry because they were running on a tight schedule.</v>

283
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 1>One of his tenants jokes,</v>

284
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>be careful or your blow us all up.</v>

285
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Parsons responded with a chocolate and said that everything would be fine.</v>

286
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.053
<v Speaker 1>An hour later,</v>

287
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>the lab exploded.</v>

288
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He was still alive,</v>

289
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 1>but half of his face had been blown off from an explosion.</v>

290
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>It was rushed to the hospital,</v>

291
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>but he died from his injuries.</v>

292
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Just 37 years old.</v>

293
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.730
<v Speaker 1>His official cause of death had been ruled as an accidents,</v>

294
00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:31.350
<v Speaker 1>but many elements of the explosion ops around it,</v>

295
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 1>a mystery.</v>

296
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 1>He had so many years of mixing chemicals and creating bombs.</v>

297
00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 1>People find it hard to believe that Jack Parsons could have made such a careless</v>

298
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:40.110
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

299
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>something that maybe it was feeling so low that he wanted to kill himself,</v>

300
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 1>but if Parsons intention truly wants to commit suicide,</v>

301
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 1>he would have known how to build a bomb that would have killed himself instantly</v>

302
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 1>instead of suffering in the hospital.</v>

303
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Some people speculate that someone wanted him dead ends.</v>

304
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.810
<v Speaker 1>They snuck into his lab to tamper with this chemicals.</v>

305
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he was assassinated by the government is a conspiracy,</v>

306
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly does make a lot of sense.</v>

307
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It seems almost too convenient that Jack Parsons blew himself up at the start of</v>

308
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:09.274
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War.</v>

309
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 1>He knew plenty of government secrets about that fledgling space program and he</v>

310
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:16.720
<v Speaker 1>was already showing signs of wanting to flee the country.</v>

311
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Parsons truly was a genius capable of building a bigger and better Rawkus than</v>

312
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the ones created by the u s government,</v>

313
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>and they may have feared that he would sell his services to the USSR.</v>

314
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Jack Parsons credited his work with the occult for a success in</v>

315
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 1>rocket science was an embarrassment the rest of the aeronautical community.</v>

316
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.190
<v Speaker 1>If the public knew about this,</v>

317
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 1>it would completely ruin the credibility of the government's attempts to build a</v>

318
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:41.974
<v Speaker 1>space program,</v>

319
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but they were already having a hard time raising taxpayer dollars without some</v>

320
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>guy chatting about sex magic.</v>

321
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.191
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

322
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 1>the program and is a lot more credibility you want to see was out of the picture</v>

323
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.461
<v Speaker 1>after his death.</v>

324
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 1>NASA would name one if the craters on the moon after Jack Parsons only.</v>

325
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>It was on the dark side.</v>

326
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>This is very much how they felt about his contribution to rocket science,</v>

327
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted to give credit where credit is due,</v>

328
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 1>but many wanted to keep his memory out of the limelight while he was alive.</v>

329
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Jack Parsons,</v>

330
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>his ultimate goal was to have his rocket experiments succeed not just for</v>

331
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

332
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.850
<v Speaker 1>but for future generations.</v>

333
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 1>He wanted the whole world to look to the stars and know that it could be a</v>

334
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 1>reality and not just some fantasy written about in a Scifi novel,</v>

335
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 1>whether you believe in the supernatural Nazi in a way past and sex magic spell</v>

336
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 1>is actually worked because all of his intentions that he sat out into the</v>

337
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>universe eventually came true.</v>

338
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.741
<v Speaker 1>Tragically,</v>

339
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 1>he did not live long enough to see NASA send demand to the moon,</v>

340
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 1>but if he was watching from across the universe,</v>

341
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 1>it would surely be proud and if you want to learn a bit about the real stuff</v>

342
00:15:40.851 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>that Parsons was interested in,</v>

343
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 1>a great way to do that is through brilliance.</v>

344
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 1>We talked a lot about rocket science in today's video and while this is</v>

345
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:50.360
<v Speaker 1>certainly a complex subject,</v>

346
00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it is one that brilliant make really easy to get to grips with.</v>

347
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>The way brilliant works is through something called active learning and it's</v>

348
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 1>really super effective.</v>

349
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Basically what this means is that you're not spending time reading about how</v>

350
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>something works,</v>

351
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 1>looking at complex equations,</v>

352
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>etc. Basically going over it again and again and again until it gets in your</v>

353
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

354
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 1>For me often.</v>

355
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 1>That's something that gets just really frustrating.</v>

356
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people feel the same way.</v>

357
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Taking rocket physics as an example,</v>

358
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>rather than showing you something really complex and explaining it,</v>

359
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>it all starts with something super simple.</v>

360
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 1>You just have to solve a puzzle related to the topic.</v>

361
00:16:24.261 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 1>It's great to see how you do a few of these puzzles and just a few minutes later</v>

362
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you find yourself saying,</v>

363
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

364
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:31.100
<v Speaker 1>so that's what the side of the equation works.</v>

365
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool and as someone without a background in science,</v>

366
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much started off thinking,</v>

367
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

368
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 1>guys in not getting to be able to explain that equation to me,</v>

369
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but just a few interactive puzzles,</v>

370
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:39.970
<v Speaker 1>lace.</v>

371
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

372
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

373
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.421
<v Speaker 1>well now I get it.</v>

374
00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:42.254
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>

375
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.060
<v Speaker 1>It really is just like that.</v>

376
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a weird way to describe the process.</v>

377
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:46.581
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

378
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it works.</v>

379
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting how the information and has your head through this way</v>

380
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 1>of active learning.</v>

381
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to learn and to support biographics and learn more about</v>
