00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Just before we get started with video today,</v>

2
00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:02.510
<v Speaker 1>you've clicked on this one,</v>

3
00:00:02.511 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you already knows about a place rather than a pass and we're trying something</v>

4
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:05.301
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

5
00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>We're experimenting.</v>

6
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.741
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

7
00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:08.390
<v Speaker 1>This is super interesting.</v>

8
00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

9
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like a biography of Chernobyl,</v>

10
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>the place and what happened there.</v>

11
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I really think you'll enjoy it and let's get into it.</v>

12
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.821
<v Speaker 1>I exactly.</v>

13
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>One 23:00 AM on April the 26,</v>

14
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>1986.</v>

15
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>The weld suffered its worst ever.</v>

16
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear disaster outside of the town of preppers in Ukraine,</v>

17
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>reacting them before the local nuclear power plants quite literally blew its</v>

18
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>

19
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Speaker 1>It released more nuclear material into the atmosphere than the Hiroshima and</v>

20
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Nagasaki explosions combined.</v>

21
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>The resulting cloud of death blanketed half of Europe led to the total</v>

22
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>evacuation of parts of north Ukraine and southern Bela reuss and triggered a</v>

23
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:51.191
<v Speaker 1>process that would end up five years later with the complete collapse of the</v>

24
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>

25
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about disasters,</v>

26
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>there are certainly a scale of disasters in this one.</v>

27
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It rang someone near the top,</v>

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but how much do most of us really know about history's worst nuclear accidents?</v>

29
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>If you go on wikipedia right now,</v>

30
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>it will tell you the total number of deaths due to drug noble is a 31.</v>

31
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>The overall impression that you get is that it's a disaster that's noticeable,</v>

32
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but not really on the same league as something like nine slash 11,</v>

33
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but impressions,</v>

34
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>they can be misleading for those living in the USSR,</v>

35
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Chernobyl,</v>

36
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>it was there 9:11.</v>

37
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>It affected workers from each republic in the Soviet Union.</v>

38
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>It permanently damaged trust in the government and it left behind a deadly</v>

39
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>legacy that still being reckons with to this very day.</v>

40
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>In the biographics video today,</v>

41
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at the story of a town,</v>

42
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>the blue up at embark.</v>

43
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a chilly February day in 1970 when the first brick of the new city was</v>

44
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>laid some 90 kilometers north of Kiev.</v>

45
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Privets was officially under construction as the ninth of the Ussr,</v>

46
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>so called atomic towns.</v>

47
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Places built solely for the families of those people working at the nuclear</v>

48
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

49
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>In this case that demands the Vladimir Lenin blondes just three kilometers</v>

50
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>

51
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>The plants,</v>

52
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>you know today,</v>

53
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>it's true noble life in bread,</v>

54
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.101
<v Speaker 1>but it was fun.</v>

55
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll be on the standards common in the Soviet Union at that time.</v>

56
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>The automatic towns with Moscow,</v>

57
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>his pride and joy,</v>

58
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>those who lived in them could expect fully stocked shops,</v>

59
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>hospitals with actual equipment since apartments that were the envy of people</v>

60
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>from Vilnius to have a lot of all stock.</v>

61
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>Even by these high standards out there was something else.</v>

62
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Former residents still talk of.</v>

63
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Local forests replete with natural beauty and wax lyrical about visiting the</v>

64
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

65
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Beach runs on sweltering summer days,</v>

66
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>but from the get go it was a darker side to this new city over at the nuclear</v>

67
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>plants or 40 is were quietly installing.</v>

68
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Rbmk reaction is famous back then for that ability to be converted to nuclear</v>

69
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>weapon production at the drop of a hat.</v>

70
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.770
<v Speaker 1>This useful ability also made them incredibly unstable like driving a car</v>

71
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>without breaks in only a short time.</v>

72
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>The reactor to prep it was going to go screaming over a cliff edge,</v>

73
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>taking his passengers right along with it.</v>

74
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>On the eve of the disaster though,</v>

75
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>everything seems to be going well,</v>

76
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.843
<v Speaker 1>just fine.</v>

77
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Officially given city status in 1979,</v>

78
00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>prep has grown into a booming metropolis,</v>

79
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>a 43,000 people with an average age of only 26.</v>

80
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>The young population meant no shortage of weddings and celebrations,</v>

81
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>and the town had become a hugely desirable posting for Soviet scientists over</v>

82
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>the Vladimir Lenin nuclear ponds for as well already up and running with a fifth</v>

83
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>one on the way form of private residence later cooled those last days a kind of</v>

84
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.554
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>

85
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>If that was the case,</v>

86
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>it was about to be one that was lost forever.</v>

87
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the greatest ironies of the should enable disaster is that it was caused</v>

88
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>by of all things safety test.</v>

89
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>On the night of April the 25th,</v>

90
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:00.781
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

91
00:04:00.781 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>86 engineers,</v>

92
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 1>untrained in nuclear physics,</v>

93
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:06.960
<v Speaker 1>decided to find out if the newly built react to number four good.</v>

94
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Still operated some emergency water pumps in case of a power failure,</v>

95
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 1>so they disconnected it from all the fail safes,</v>

96
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.580
<v Speaker 1>removed the control rods and shut off the main power source.</v>

97
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There was always a edge that almost immediately ran out of control in a panic.</v>

98
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>The engineers tried to reinstate all 200 control rods back into the reactor at</v>

99
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

100
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 1>This turned out to be a really bad idea.</v>

101
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 1>The control Rod said graphite tips that facilitated the unstable reactions that</v>

102
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>were already taking place no sooner were they in the reactive and it was hit</v>

103
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>with the mother of all explosions.</v>

104
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>The 1,200 ton cover,</v>

105
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.360
<v Speaker 1>it was blasted into the APP.</v>

106
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Radioactive debris shot a kilometer into the night sky to workers in that</v>

107
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:50.551
<v Speaker 1>control room.</v>

108
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll just killed immediately.</v>

109
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.741
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly.</v>

110
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:56.900
<v Speaker 1>This survivors of the plans had no idea that just triggered a bonafide</v>

111
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.330
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe there.</v>

112
00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Geiger counters what good up to detect,</v>

113
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>low amounts of radiation exposure,</v>

114
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>the sort of thing you might normally expect from working at a nuclear plant.</v>

115
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>When the reactive spewed forth some of the highest radiation levels ever seen,</v>

116
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 1>the geiger counters just stopped working back in prep apps.</v>

117
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 1>The local fire brigade mobilized nearly 30 minutes,</v>

118
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>screamed up to the reactor in their trucks with no protective clothing on and</v>

119
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 1>pour water onto the fire.</v>

120
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That was raging,</v>

121
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.213
<v Speaker 1>but the flames,</v>

122
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't go out and not only that,</v>

123
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>the men complains of a metallic taste on their tongues and the feeling of pins</v>

124
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>and needles in that faces by the time they got home.</v>

125
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>At the end of that shifts,</v>

126
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:37.260
<v Speaker 1>a number of these first responders were already showing signs of acute radiation</v>

127
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:38.094
<v Speaker 1>sickness,</v>

128
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.440
<v Speaker 1>yet still no emergency was declared.</v>

129
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 1>When news reached Moscow at 5:00 AM Soviet leader,</v>

130
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Gorbachev was infamously told that the reaction was so safe,</v>

131
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.510
<v Speaker 1>it could be placed in the middle of Red Square,</v>

132
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>had Gorbachev taken them up on that offer would have been a heck of a site.</v>

133
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 1>The ruins of reactor number four,</v>

134
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>where at this point buried under 14 tons of highly rubble and burning it 3000</v>

135
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

136
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It was also spewing radiation over north Ukraine and southern better reuse,</v>

137
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>plenty of which was already finding its way to Pripyat.</v>

138
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Is it been a hot night that night and prevents many slept with that window's</v>

139
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.300
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

140
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>unaware the cancer causing particles when are blowing into their bedrooms and</v>

141
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>saturating on they're exhausted bodies.</v>

142
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Yet when we woke up,</v>

143
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.730
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't too warranted.</v>

144
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Mass panic to an ordinary day.</v>

145
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.511
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

146
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>most of these people were nuclear plants workers and most new something has</v>

147
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:27.681
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

148
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but no one knew the full extent of the disaster.</v>

149
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>As radiation fell and invisible deadly clouds.</v>

150
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Children played outside in the streets.</v>

151
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Mothers went shopping and men got ready for work.</v>

152
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>The one discordant note was the sudden appearance of mosque soldiers on the city</v>

153
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>streets.</v>

154
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>They stood in twos or threes,</v>

155
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>monitoring the crowds and not answering questions.</v>

156
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>It was the first sign the residents of prep outside of the nuclear tsunami that</v>

157
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>was about to engulf them all by the evening of April 26 radiation levels in prep</v>

158
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>out west 600,000 times the normal,</v>

159
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>the excellent documentary,</v>

160
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.370
<v Speaker 1>the basket which neighbor,</v>

161
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is one of the main sources for the section,</v>

162
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 1>estimated that anyone exposed to those levels would have received a lethal dose</v>

163
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>interest for days.</v>

164
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Clearly the Soviet authorities were going to have to react fast.</v>

165
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>A tpm on April the 27th with the deadly fire,</v>

166
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>still burning three kilometers away,</v>

167
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>a thousand school buses were driven into prep and parked on every street</v>

168
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 1>residence were gone outside and told they had two hours to pack their belongings</v>

169
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>and prepared to be evacuated.</v>

170
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>There's been an accident.</v>

171
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

172
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.881
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

173
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you'll be away for three days and we'll sort this all out,</v>

174
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>and then you can come right back.</v>

175
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

176
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>come on with the Soviet authorities,</v>

177
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>we lie to you so that's residents prepared to leave their paradise.</v>

178
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>They packed quickly,</v>

179
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>taking only what they could carry.</v>

180
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Then all 43,000 when loaded onto the buses and driven away in the vast flat</v>

181
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>emptiness of northern Ukraine.</v>

182
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>None of these people would ever see that homes again.</v>

183
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

184
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:05.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

185
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in Moscow while this nuclear apocalypse was unfolding?</v>

186
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>the answer is nothing.</v>

188
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 1>at least not much.</v>

190
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>The credit then did put a scientific delegation together to study the problem,</v>

191
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>but aside from that,</v>

192
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Soviet authorities basically sat on my hands like a kid who's faster,</v>

193
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>just a party and tried not to let the rest of the big countries see him</v>

194
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.743
<v Speaker 1>blushing.</v>

195
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.471
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

196
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the radioactive fought,</v>

197
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>or at least by Chernobyl,</v>

198
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>was just like a regular fat in one important respect,</v>

199
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>it stank and also in the eggs and then kind of way,</v>

200
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>but the stench of radiation which is capable of being picked up by even the most</v>

201
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>basic of equipment.</v>

202
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>On April the 28th Swedish scientists monitoring their own nuclear plants caught</v>

203
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>the first whiff of that silence and very,</v>

204
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>very deadly emission with only what we can imagine was a figurative.</v>

205
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>They all turns do the other countries and said,</v>

206
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:57.721
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

207
00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 1>guess what the US is lodges did.</v>

208
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.911
<v Speaker 1>Now will they?</v>

209
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Moscow would try the geopolitical equivalence of whoever smells at Delta for the</v>

210
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>next 24 hours.</v>

211
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.670
<v Speaker 1>The jig and it was up on April the 29th.</v>

212
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 1>The Kremlin came clean.</v>

213
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.983
<v Speaker 1>From this point on,</v>

214
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I became a global emergency.</v>

215
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.460
<v Speaker 1>It was around this point that the first responders arrived in Moscow,</v>

216
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>is hospital number six,</v>

217
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>the one place in the whole of the Soviet Union get up to treat acute radiation,</v>

218
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>sickness of the he also farm,</v>

219
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and he would responded that night,</v>

220
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>28 would die in agony,</v>

221
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.820
<v Speaker 1>fair skin bund from that boons by an invisible enemy in the aftermath of the</v>

222
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>first responders,</v>

223
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>deaths and additional a hundred 30,000 people were evacuated from the towns and</v>

224
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.750
<v Speaker 1>villages surrounding prep apps.</v>

225
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.631
<v Speaker 1>Yet even now,</v>

226
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:43.670
<v Speaker 1>these Soviet authorities response remains woefully lacks in Kiev.</v>

227
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.790
<v Speaker 1>A mayday parade was held with the blessing of the Communist Party despite a</v>

228
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>change in wind direction,</v>

229
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 1>meaning radioactive dust was now fooling on the Ukrainian capital like a deadly</v>

230
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>reign one week off to the initial blast,</v>

231
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>the meltdown.</v>

232
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It was still going on.</v>

233
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.810
<v Speaker 1>The fire itself had been put out with sends,</v>

234
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but the reacts to it continued to burn.</v>

235
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:02.731
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

236
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>dangerous readings were coming in from his phone away is Greece and France.</v>

237
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>It was against this worrying backdrop that the International Atomic Energy</v>

238
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Agency made is most worrying announcement default with the reactor melting</v>

239
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 1>downwards through the Pons trenoble.</v>

240
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>It was on the brink of a full blown nuclear explosion time,</v>

241
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.493
<v Speaker 1>real quick explainer,</v>

242
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.100
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

243
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>the first now dead firemen had dumped into the reactor,</v>

244
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 1>had pooled at the bottom with a top of the destroyed reactor,</v>

245
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>now plugged with sand to contain the fire.</v>

246
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Any molten radioactive goo that reached the water could trigger a chain</v>

247
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:34.531
<v Speaker 1>reaction,</v>

248
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>which in turn could trigger a nuclear explosion,</v>

249
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about something in the range of three megatons yeah,</v>

250
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 1>that's 200 times the size of the bomb that fattened Hiroshima according to the</v>

251
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:46.880
<v Speaker 1>utterly terrifying online tool,</v>

252
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 1>new comap.</v>

253
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the way the wind was blowing,</v>

254
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.440
<v Speaker 1>this could have doubts,</v>

255
00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:51.370
<v Speaker 1>not just Minsk,</v>

256
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>but also Vilnius,</v>

257
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>all the way in Lithuania with catastrophic levels of radiation where the wind's</v>

258
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.021
<v Speaker 1>blowing toward us.</v>

259
00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Kiev,</v>

260
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>95 kilometers to the south,</v>

261
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>it could have turned the Ukrainian capital into a silent tuner.</v>

262
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that the liquidators arrived in the last years of the USSR.</v>

263
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 1>The liquidators were the equivalent of nine slash 11 first responders,</v>

264
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the men and women who were marched into the jaws of death determined to do that</v>

265
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>duty.</v>

266
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 1>They comprised army reservists,</v>

267
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>firemen,</v>

268
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.021
<v Speaker 1>nurses,</v>

269
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:19.771
<v Speaker 1>police officers,</v>

270
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>miners and pilots,</v>

271
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 1>plus the scientists and workers who accompanied them.</v>

272
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 1>They came from every single one of the Soviet republics,</v>

273
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>from Estonia to Georgia,</v>

274
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 1>from Kazakhstan to as Pakistan old,</v>

275
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

276
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 1>half a million of them converged on Chernobyl during the dark days of mid 1986.</v>

277
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Very few of them escaped on Scott.</v>

278
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>To read this story is to read a tale of heroism and suffering,</v>

279
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.390
<v Speaker 1>not seen since the siege of Stalin Grad.</v>

280
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 1>There are the 600 pilots who flew over the burning reactive,</v>

281
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.440
<v Speaker 1>dropping lead on it to plug the broken top.</v>

282
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Latest suffered myriad health problems.</v>

283
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>There are 125 five and sent beneath the meltdowns and drain the water out and</v>

284
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 1>stop the second explosion,</v>

285
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 1>most of whom got sick and then there are the 10,000 miners who came from Russia</v>

286
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 1>to create a concrete chamber beneath the reactor to stop it poisoning the</v>

287
00:12:06.671 --> 00:12:07.504
<v Speaker 1>groundwater.</v>

288
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 500 of which would die before the age of 40 that were then ordered</v>

289
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.060
<v Speaker 1>to clear radioactive debris from the roof of the power plants were radiation</v>

290
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:18.600
<v Speaker 1>levels were so high they have to work in 40 seconds.</v>

291
00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Shifts or risk receiving a fatal dose.</v>

292
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Miners were forced to dig in 24 hours shifts without any protective clothing.</v>

293
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Then there are all the stories of the cleanup decontamination at the sign</v>

294
00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

295
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>The countryside surrounding Pripyat was so contaminated.</v>

296
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Entire forest tent to be bulldozed,</v>

297
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>buried villages were scrubbed from tip to toe,</v>

298
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>perhaps most shockingly special squads were given guns and sent out into the</v>

299
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 1>countryside to shoot all the dogs and cats less.</v>

300
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They're radioactive now prove a danger to humans all told.</v>

301
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the biggest clean operations in human history,</v>

302
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>rivaling even deepwater horizon.</v>

303
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 1>It lasted six months,</v>

304
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>whereupon a 30 mile exclusion zone was established around prep apps and it</v>

305
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.500
<v Speaker 1>remains there to this very day.</v>

306
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>The final capstone was the sarcophagus.</v>

307
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.950
<v Speaker 1>This was a concrete Bam off.</v>

308
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It was placed over the reactor at the very end of 1986,</v>

309
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:09.320
<v Speaker 1>just as the first snows began to fall.</v>

310
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It seals reacts number four off from the outside world completely ensuring that</v>

311
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 1>it would remain safe at least for a time you see the sarcophagus.</v>

312
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It was built in a hurry and there was designed to only last 30 years.</v>

313
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't seen as a problem is when 2016 finally rolled around.</v>

314
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet authorities would clearly still be in charge and Ukraine and that'd</v>

315
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 1>be able to replace it with another one.</v>

316
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

317
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the entire Ussr always gonna compete.</v>

318
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>You collapsed in the next half decade or so,</v>

319
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.703
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

320
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.281
<v Speaker 1>on November the ninth,</v>

321
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:42.580
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

322
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.031
<v Speaker 1>89.</v>

323
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>The world watched in horror as ordinary Germans toppled great chunks of the</v>

324
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Berlin Wall.</v>

325
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

326
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>God swatched on it was the start of the complete collapse of communism in</v>

327
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Eastern Europe and the final dissolution of the USSR in Ukraine,</v>

328
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 1>mass protests against Moscow didn't break out until 1991,</v>

329
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:00.610
<v Speaker 1>but when they did,</v>

330
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 1>they did so under trend nobles,</v>

331
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>deadly cloud in Kiev,</v>

332
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>protesters were photographed in gas masks.</v>

333
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And protective clothing waving signs referencing the disaster at a political</v>

334
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:10.931
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

335
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>The shutting out of Ukrainians from a disaster in their own backyard had immense</v>

336
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:16.414
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>

337
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>the most immediate of which was key ever declaring independence on August 24th</v>

338
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>that year,</v>

339
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.930
<v Speaker 1>but the fallout from Chernobyl had effects fall beyond Ukraine.</v>

340
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>The Economist has argued that the huge economic hits the USSR took from the</v>

341
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>disaster directly lead to its collapse,</v>

342
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but on the fringes of the Chernobyl exclusion zone,</v>

343
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>former residents of prep had watched these events with undoubtedly mixed</v>

344
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:41.560
<v Speaker 1>feelings while their homes had been lost,</v>

345
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>the authorities that built them a new city to recreate that paradise.</v>

346
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Many of them still worked at the old power powerplan's.</v>

347
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.431
<v Speaker 1>Remarkably,</v>

348
00:14:48.431 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the three other reactors had been restarted by the end of 1986.</v>

349
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.761
<v Speaker 1>Apparently,</v>

350
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 1>danger be damned yet new cities can't make up for the toll.</v>

351
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Trenoble took on its liquidators across the USSR.</v>

352
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals had spent the last five years flooded with those who worked in the</v>

353
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:05.000
<v Speaker 1>zone today.</v>

354
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's estimated that around a third of the surviving liquidators are disabled in</v>

355
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>some way in Bela Reuss,</v>

356
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 1>which got more radiation than Ukraine.</v>

357
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.180
<v Speaker 1>One study estimated that as many as 20 percent of the adolescent population</v>

358
00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:19.670
<v Speaker 1>suffered birth defects related to the accident,</v>

359
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.910
<v Speaker 1>as for the number of excess cancer deaths Chernobyl caused,</v>

360
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 1>we simply don't know the World Health Organization estimated on the 20th</v>

361
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 1>anniversary that it was around 4,000,</v>

362
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>but estimates vary wildly.</v>

363
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 1>One of you report,</v>

364
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but the number closer to $60,000,</v>

365
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.413
<v Speaker 1>whatever the truth,</v>

366
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.300
<v Speaker 1>the aftermath of Chernobyl has been a source of anger in Ukraine and better</v>

367
00:15:39.301 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 1>batteries ever since when the plants,</v>

368
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>other reactors were finally shut down and following international pressure in</v>

369
00:15:44.781 --> 00:15:49.781
<v Speaker 1>2001 few lamented that passing the drama when it wasn't over in the late 19</v>

370
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:51.471
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

371
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 1>it became clear that Ukraine was never going to be capable of rebuilding the</v>

372
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>sarcophagus.</v>

373
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 1>When it finally failed,</v>

374
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>it was at this point that it became abundantly clear that the sarcophagus was</v>

375
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>never going to make us until 2016,</v>

376
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.970
<v Speaker 1>despite being built to last 30 years.</v>

377
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>The Soviet sarcophagus was already on the brink of collapse.</v>

378
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 1>The next 10 years alone were spent shoring up the old structure to prevent</v>

379
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 1>another catastrophe.</v>

380
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Then in the mid two thousands and new song called Fergus had to be built that</v>

381
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>would completely contained the old one at a staggering 35,000 tons.</v>

382
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 1>The new sarcophagus,</v>

383
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.230
<v Speaker 1>it was a miracle of engineering,</v>

384
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 1>builds 300 meters away from react to number four to limit radiation exposure.</v>

385
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 1>It took 10 years to assemble.</v>

386
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 1>It then had to be rolled over the old sarcophagus and completely sealed.</v>

387
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 1>It was taller than the statue of liberty and bigger than an Olympic stadium when</v>

388
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.180
<v Speaker 1>it was finally sealed in November of 2016,</v>

389
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 1>and it cost one point $5,000,000,000.</v>

390
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.810
<v Speaker 1>This one though,</v>

391
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>it's expected to last the next one,</v>

392
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:47.144
<v Speaker 1>hundred years.</v>

393
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.980
<v Speaker 1>During that time,</v>

394
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.850
<v Speaker 1>robots inside.</v>

395
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 1>We'll deconstruct the old sarcophagus before finally dismantling and making the</v>

396
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:54.530
<v Speaker 1>reactor itself safe.</v>

397
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>When the new sarcophagus finally reaches his end in 2116,</v>

398
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it's hoped humanity,</v>

399
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 1>we need to build an even bigger one today.</v>

400
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 1>The glistening new structure,</v>

401
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it looks over a landscape that's very different from the one reacted.</v>

402
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.981
<v Speaker 1>Number four,</v>

403
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 1>changed forever.</v>

404
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:08.990
<v Speaker 1>In 1986,</v>

405
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 1>the x paradise of prep that is no longer just empty this crumbling away beneath</v>

406
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>and on sort of nature,</v>

407
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 1>the ones team forest,</v>

408
00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 1>so now so devoid of people that the exclusion zone has become an accidental</v>

409
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:21.170
<v Speaker 1>wildlife reserve.</v>

410
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Teaming with wolves,</v>

411
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 1>bears,</v>

412
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.370
<v Speaker 1>beavers,</v>

413
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.203
<v Speaker 1>and links,</v>

414
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.260
<v Speaker 1>not the people that have completely vanished though just a few short years ago,</v>

415
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:31.190
<v Speaker 1>the Ukrainian government agreed to let a small number of Chernobyl evacuees back</v>

416
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:32.630
<v Speaker 1>in around $200.</v>

417
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

418
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 1>if within the zone itself,</v>

419
00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>dicing with death on a daily basis,</v>

420
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you can even go to visit them tonight.</v>

421
00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 1>We'll receives tens of thousands of tourists a year drawn by the allure of</v>

422
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine's,</v>

423
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 1>very own pompei and I actually went to did this last year and it's well worth</v>

424
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 1>doing as for the disaster itself.</v>

425
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

426
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 1>thankfully it remains the worst nuclear accidents on record that as the</v>

427
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Fukushima meltdown in 2011 was,</v>

428
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it didn't even come close to 1986 eruption.</v>

429
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully neither accident will ever be exceeded.</v>

430
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:02.671
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

431
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:06.360
<v Speaker 1>normally this is the point where we wrap up a biography and say a few pithy</v>

432
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>things and just that those credits roll,</v>

433
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:11.320
<v Speaker 1>but Chernobyl story when it's still far from Ovid,</v>

434
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated that the zone will remain uninhabitable for humans for another</v>

435
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:16.650
<v Speaker 1>24,000 years,</v>

436
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 1>a stretch of time that's almost beyond comprehension.</v>

437
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It was only four and a half thousand years ago that the pyramids were first</v>

438
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.383
<v Speaker 1>built in Egypt.</v>

439
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Try to imagine for a moment just how different life was back then,</v>

440
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 1>how impossible it would have been for your average slave to close his eyes and</v>

441
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 1>imagine our orwell's to imagine spaceflight penicillin,</v>

442
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the outs now,</v>

443
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:39.600
<v Speaker 1>multiply that feeling by a factor of six.</v>

444
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.730
<v Speaker 1>You'd have some idea of the scale of time left until Chernobyl's affects.</v>

445
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Stop being felt.</v>

446
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll story today.</v>

447
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.451
<v Speaker 1>It might be over,</v>

448
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:51.840
<v Speaker 1>but the tale of Chernobyl is only just getting started,</v>

449
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 1>so I hope you found this video interesting and there's a little bit different to</v>

450
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>our normal stuff,</v>

451
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but we thought we'd try a biography of a place just for a change of pace.</v>

452
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I found this one personally super interesting and if you did like it,</v>
