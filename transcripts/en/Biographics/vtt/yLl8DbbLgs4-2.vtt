1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>He is the epitome of pure,</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>unadulterated evil,</v>

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the mastermind gallery with the swastika on his forehead and the wild crazed</v>

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>look in his eyes.</v>

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>He is responsible for one of the most heinous crimes of our time,</v>

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>controlling his minions like puppeteer.</v>

7
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>In this week's buying graphics.</v>

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>We're looking into the dark and disturbing story of Charles Manson.</v>

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Charles Mills Manson was born on November the twelfth and Nineteen 34 to 16 year</v>

10
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:41.221
<v Speaker 1>old Kathleen Maddox and the 24 year old tranzians labor known only as Colonel</v>

11
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Scott.</v>

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen was a promiscuous teenager who drank too much and earns money to fuel</v>

13
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>their habits by selling her body.</v>

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>The baby was known as new name Maddix for the first few weeks of life until his</v>

15
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>mother seemed to settle on Shawnee.</v>

16
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>He never knew his father.</v>

17
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>He cleared out as soon as he heard the Kathleen was pregnant.</v>

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen was too young,</v>

19
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>too immature,</v>

20
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and unpredictable to provide a stable environment for a young child.</v>

21
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 1>She appeared to have new maternal instincts and would leave the trial to fend</v>

22
00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>for himself while she went off on one of our vendors.</v>

23
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>As an adult.</v>

24
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Charlie often related to that his mother was once in a cafe with him on her knee</v>

25
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>when the waitress offered to buy the baby from her.</v>

26
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen's asking price was a pitcher of beer and having consumed as she simply</v>

27
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 1>walked out and left Charlie to the women.</v>

28
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.931
<v Speaker 1>According to Charlie,</v>

29
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>his uncle took four days to track him down and return him home.</v>

30
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>When Charlie was six years old,</v>

31
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>his mother and uncle decided to rob a gas station.</v>

32
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.383
<v Speaker 1>They were both caught,</v>

33
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>convicted and sent for five years to Moundsville state prison.</v>

34
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>The boy was putting into the have is strictly religious grandparents,</v>

35
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:44.140
<v Speaker 1>but after a few months he went to live with his aunt and uncle in West Virginia.</v>

36
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.930
<v Speaker 1>The environment was very different to anything.</v>

37
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Shawnee had previously known his aunt.</v>

38
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>His sister was regimens in disciplines.</v>

39
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.260
<v Speaker 1>She was also strictly religious.</v>

40
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Her husband's build was even more fervent in his faith and his wife,</v>

41
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>a strict disciplinarian.</v>

42
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>He considered jolly to be a sissy.</v>

43
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>On the first day of school,</v>

44
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>he said the boy to class and address in order to teach him how to fight.</v>

45
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Shawnee seemed adapt it to this very different kind of life and actually grew to</v>

46
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Speaker 1>enjoy his new regimented routine for two years,</v>

47
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>between six and eight would prove to be some of the most stable of his young</v>

48
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

49
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but then his mother was released from prison and immediately took him back.</v>

50
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Gasoline was more unstable than ever.</v>

51
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 1>She preferred a life of promiscuity and alcohol abuse to botanical,</v>

52
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>domesticity,</v>

53
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.480
<v Speaker 1>constantly in trouble with the law runs with no money for food and board.</v>

54
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 1>They constantly moved around.</v>

55
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>The Midwest or the age of nine.</v>

56
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Trolley dropped out of school.</v>

57
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>The transient life that he was forced to live shapes the type of boy that</v>

58
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Charlie would become.</v>

59
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>He kept to himself living his life through his imagination.</v>

60
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>He was constantly watching,</v>

61
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>taking things in and dreaming of a future free of is no hope.</v>

62
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Mother,</v>

63
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>he also learns how to become a very accomplished thief is age nine.</v>

64
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte was caught stealing and sent to reform school.</v>

65
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.431
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

66
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 1>he was caught again.</v>

67
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>This time he was off to the old school for boys in Indiana before he was taken</v>

68
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.101
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

69
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Kathleen promised to visit him often.</v>

70
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Of course they never did.</v>

71
00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just 10 months into his incarceration.</v>

72
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.983
<v Speaker 1>He escapes.</v>

73
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>He robbed a grocery store to get some money,</v>

74
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>and when that ran out,</v>

75
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>he stole other things including a bicycle.</v>

76
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>He got caught in the act of making off with the bike and soon found himself back</v>

77
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.654
<v Speaker 1>in confinements.</v>

78
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>This time he was sent to Indiana juvenile center.</v>

79
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>That's often just two days.</v>

80
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>He stole some cutters,</v>

81
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>freeze,</v>

82
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>and not any himself.</v>

83
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>That's 30 other boys.</v>

84
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.710
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

85
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>the you on Phelan installed motorbike,</v>

86
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>but rather a car,</v>

87
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but the 13 year old could hardly see over the steering wheel and was apprehended</v>

88
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>within hours of his escape.</v>

89
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>When he ended up in juvenile court,</v>

90
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>he was surprised to see his mother.</v>

91
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>His spirits were dashed.</v>

92
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:37.781
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

93
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>when she testified that she would not take him in the somewhat sympathetic judge</v>

94
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>sent Charlie to Father Flanagan's boys town,</v>

95
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>but the state hip,</v>

96
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it was almost too short is this last incarceration.</v>

97
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>After just four days,</v>

98
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>he ran off with another young offender,</v>

99
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Blackie Nelson.</v>

100
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>They stole a car which they subsequently crashed cell and they made their ways</v>

101
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:55.991
<v Speaker 1>in the hands of black,</v>

102
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:56.461
<v Speaker 1>his uncle,</v>

103
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>a world war two veteran and an underworld figure.</v>

104
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>You gave the young hoodlums,</v>

105
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>freeboard and food in exchange for the proceeds from armed robberies that he</v>

106
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>happened commit during that third robbery.</v>

107
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>The two boys were caught.</v>

108
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>This time at Shawnee was sent to the Indiana School for boys in Plainfield here.</v>

109
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>He stayed for three years.</v>

110
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Charlie would laser claim that his small statuette led him to be constantly</v>

111
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>raped and sodomized by other inmates as well as by the school employees.</v>

112
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>They also recalls that he was constantly picked on by the gods who would</v>

113
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.910
<v Speaker 1>continually find fault with him beating him with leather straps and wooden</v>

114
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.773
<v Speaker 1>clubs.</v>

115
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>One night after being gang raped by her group of older boys,</v>

116
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>he beat one of his attack as do just short of the point of death with an iron</v>

117
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:41.970
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>

118
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>As the boy lay sleeping,</v>

119
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Charlie then place the bar under the bed of one of the other attack is</v>

120
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.540
<v Speaker 1>successfully implicating him in the attack.</v>

121
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Johnny was exhibiting a trait that would characterize this personality as an</v>

122
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.010
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

123
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 1>This was that he would hold his hand,</v>

124
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 1>get in for a time only for it to explode later in an orgy of violence.</v>

125
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Over the three years he spent at Plainfield,</v>

126
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>shawnee escaped no less than 18 times.</v>

127
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>He was returned every time though,</v>

128
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and in March of 1951,</v>

129
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 1>his sentence was increased and he was sent to a minimum security institution.</v>

130
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.200
<v Speaker 1>This was the national training school for boys in Washington DC.</v>

131
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Things were very different to what Charlie had known at plainfield.</v>

133
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>The facility was well run.</v>

134
00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:22.950
<v Speaker 1>The boys were treated well and it's a genuine focus,</v>

135
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:24.840
<v Speaker 1>was placed on rehabilitation.</v>

136
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Scholly liked that,</v>

137
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>but he had no interest in being rehabilitated.</v>

138
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.603
<v Speaker 1>He'll do his time,</v>

139
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.570
<v Speaker 1>but then it get back out to the life of crime that he knew was waiting for him</v>

140
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.920
<v Speaker 1>at around the age of 15,</v>

141
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:37.290

<v Speaker 1>he was picked up and returned to Los Angeles to face a 10 year sentence for</v>

217
00:08:10.171 --> 00:08:12.090

225
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.030
<v Speaker 1>During his time at Mcneil Island.</v>

226
00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:25.740
<v Speaker 1>He also became obsessed with the Beatles.</v>

227
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Charlie has an inflated appreciation of his own musical talents,</v>

228
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:33.630
<v Speaker 1>claiming that he would with the right backing and training be even bigger than</v>

229
00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:34.380
<v Speaker 1>the Beatles.</v>

230

233
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.670
<v Speaker 1>He taught charlie how to play the steel guitar.</v>

234
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.210
<v Speaker 1>This further fueled his musical obsession and did in 1966.</v>

235
00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's prison record is that he spent most of his free time writing songs,</v>

236
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:57.351
<v Speaker 1>accumulating 80 or 90 of them in a single later commented on the Charlie that he</v>

237
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>knew at that time.</v>

238
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>He recalled that Manson was a master manipulator of other people.</v>

239
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Prison authorities also noted that he had a tremendous drive to call attention</v>

240
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:06.774
<v Speaker 1>to himself.</v>

241
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1966,</v>

242
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>charlie was sent once against terminal island.</v>

243
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>This time in preparation for early release when the day arrived on March the</v>

244
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>21st 1967,</v>

245
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>he had spent more than half of his 32 years behind bars.</v>

246
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>He requested that the authorities let him stay in jail,</v>

247
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but he was told that he had to leave</v>

248
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and so it was that the five foot,</v>

249
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>nothing drifted with the penetrating stare and gift of the Gab wonders into the</v>

250
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:40.191
<v Speaker 1>height Ashbury district of San Francisco with $35 in his pocket and no plans</v>

251
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 1>except for a desire to make it big in the music business.</v>

252
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Jolly moved into an apartment in Berkeley and made money by panhandling before</v>

253
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>long year your sins and every 23 year old assistant librarian at uc Berkeley</v>

254
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>named Mary Brunner,</v>

255
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 1>he quickly one to rover and moved into our apartments.</v>

256
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Bronto came into Charlie's spell and he convinced her to widen out the higher.</v>

257
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Within a few months they were 18 young women living with them.</v>

258
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Charlie introduced to Mary and the other girls to drugs and before long married</v>

259
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>quit her job and become a devoted follower of Manson.</v>

260
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 1>The family was beginning to take shape with his female entourage and his guitar.</v>

261
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Charlie merged perfectly into the hippie culture that was then in full bloom in</v>

262
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:17.904
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco.</v>

263
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.550
<v Speaker 1>He refined his role as a spiritual master.</v>

264
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>A Guru as a prophet,</v>

265
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>he used mind control techniques.</v>

266
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you get girls to do whatever he wants it?</v>

267
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Most of the girls that gathered around him came from troubled backgrounds and</v>

268
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>suffered from insecurities that left them directly,</v>

269
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 1>opens at Charlie's manipulations,</v>

270
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>as well as breaking down their inhibitions with mind control techniques.</v>

271
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 1>He used LSD and amphetamines to control his ever expanding harm.</v>

272
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>After about nine months living in and around San Francisco,</v>

273
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Charlie began to despair if the place it had become to overrun with African</v>

274
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Americans and crime was rampant.</v>

275
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course that family were doing their best to undo those crimes statistics.</v>

276
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>They stole a credit cards and used counterfeit money to get what they need it.</v>

277
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They also stole a big yellow bus and painted it black</v>

278
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>johnny and just follow his traveling by bus down the California coastline as far</v>

279
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 1>as Mexico and taxes,</v>

280
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>partying and committing more crimes after 18 months,</v>

281
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 1>so extended travel.</v>

282
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 1>They finally settled in Topanga Canyon near Los Angeles in a two story house.</v>

283
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It was here that shawnee began gathering some male members to the family.</v>

284
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>The first was a teenager named Bobby Beausoleil who turned up one night for a</v>

285
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:31.740
<v Speaker 1>party and then stayed on this Charlie's righthand man,</v>

286
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>but we had been staying with his music teacher,</v>

287
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:34.441
<v Speaker 1>Gary Hinman,</v>

288
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:35.740
<v Speaker 1>not far from the medicine Hyman,</v>

289
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>but we recruited an 18 year old named Leslie van,</v>

290
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 1>who teens or the family in June of 1968 around land time scholly,</v>

291
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 1>and some of the gals traveled to Los Angeles where they mess up with a record</v>

292
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>executive at universal studios,</v>

293
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>former jail friends feel calvin had arranged the meeting.</v>

294
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>This was Charlie's entry into the rich jet crowd and he turns on all of his</v>

295
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>charms and make a good impression.</v>

296
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Seeing the family were rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous at posh</v>

297
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 1>parties in the Hollywood hills in the late spring of 1968 beach boys drama.</v>

298
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Wilson was driving away from Malibu beach when he happened to pick up two</v>

299
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 1>hitchhikers.</v>

300
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.830
<v Speaker 1>The girls were parts of the Manson family and they quickly agreed to go back to</v>

301
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>his beverly hills home.</v>

302
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>The three made love that afternoon and Wilson left for a recording session</v>

303
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 1>promising to return later to take up where they left off.</v>

304
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>When Wilson returned home in the early hours of the following morning,</v>

305
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>he was surprised to see that a full scale party was underway.</v>

306
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.050
<v Speaker 1>He was greeted in the driveway by short man with a scraggly beard who approached</v>

307
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

308
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>dropped to his knees,</v>

309
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>and began kissing his feet.</v>

310
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>The girls who Dennis had met earlier,</v>

311
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I came running out declaring this is the guy and we've been telling you about.</v>

312
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>This is Charlie inside his home,</v>

313
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Wilson founder.</v>

314
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 1>12 more women,</v>

315
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.720
<v Speaker 1>most of them topless lying around and smoking pot.</v>

316
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Madison told him that the girls were all there for Wilson's pleasure.</v>

317
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Wilson was impressed with the sway that Charlie held over the women.</v>

318
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>He welcomes the family with open arms and this phone became the regular venue</v>

319
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:54.170
<v Speaker 1>for channel.</v>

320
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You orchestrated orgies.</v>

321
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Wilson Calls Manson the wizard and began inviting.</v>

322
00:12:58.241 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Influential friends do come and meet him.</v>

323
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Dennis also allow Charlie to use anything you wanted as a Ferrari or a Rolls</v>

324
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Royce and all the food and drink and drugs that he or his group he's wanted.</v>

325
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Wilson's manager became fed up with the influence and expense that</v>

326
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>medicine was having on his clients and Charlie and the girls were ordered out of</v>

327
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:16.024
<v Speaker 1>the mansion.</v>

328
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.660
<v Speaker 1>We're also spreading of the children of the rich and famous being given drugs</v>

329
00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and having sex.</v>

330
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm Chinese direction.</v>

331
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the door to the Hollywood elite lifestyle it would slam shut.</v>

332
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Charlie's planned for a music career was also shut down.</v>

333
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.801
<v Speaker 1>This coolest,</v>

334
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>a familiar buildup of jealousy,</v>

335
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.111
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

336
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and rage that would inevitably find expression in violence.</v>

337
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Manson managed to convince the owner of a former western movie set the spawn</v>

338
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:44.200
<v Speaker 1>ranch and Chatswood not far from Topanga Canyon to allow the family to live in</v>

339
00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the abandoned his property.</v>

340
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 1>The family now moved to the ranch,</v>

341
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:48.940
<v Speaker 1>getting by by stealing and scavenging.</v>

342
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Johnny took to quoting.</v>

343
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 1>The Bible is family members as they gathered around a bonfire during the</v>

344
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>evenings.</v>

345
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>He also interpreted beatle songs explaining that the lyrics were directed</v>

346
00:13:57.491 --> 00:13:58.324
<v Speaker 1>towards them.</v>

347
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 1>He was obsessed with one song helter skelter,</v>

348
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.110
<v Speaker 1>telling his followers that the song envisions and apocalypse brought on by a</v>

349
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 1>race war of blacks killing whites.</v>

350
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 1>The blacks would when he said,</v>

351
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but it would then sounds a medicine to lead the new wells</v>

352
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.011
<v Speaker 1>for Charlie.</v>

353
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:17.311
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

354
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>the revolution was taking too long.</v>

355
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:21.450
<v Speaker 1>He wanted it to happen immediately.</v>

356
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.590
<v Speaker 1>He began preparing family members for a series of actions that would precipitate</v>

357
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the black uprising.</v>

358
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.120
<v Speaker 1>The first step would be to release an album of music that would contain subtle</v>

359
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:32.610
<v Speaker 1>messages that would commence the black revolution.</v>

00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 1>the chest.</v>

421
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Watson then ordered Linda Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate.</v>

422
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>He and the other two women made their way into the house.</v>

423
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.530
<v Speaker 1>The occupants were quickly gathered together in the lounge when asked by for</v>

424
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Koski who they were once in replied,</v>

425
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm the devil and I'm here to do the devil's work.</v>

426
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Watson then began to tie the heavily pregnant Sharon tate and Jay sebring</v>

427
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 1>together by their necks with rope brought and slung over a beam.</v>

428
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:01.851
<v Speaker 1>Went sebring,</v>

429
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>protested over the rough handling of Sharon watts,</v>

430
00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>an shot him and then stamped him seven times.</v>

431
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile for Koski,</v>

432
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.800
<v Speaker 1>began struggling with Susan Atkins.</v>

433
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>He repeatedly stabbed him in the legs and torso,</v>

434
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>still managed to get to the front door,</v>

435
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:15.381
<v Speaker 1>seeing this.</v>

436
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:19.040
<v Speaker 1>What's an rushed after him meeting up with him on the porch and smashing his</v>

437
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:19.871
<v Speaker 1>head with gun,</v>

438
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>but before shooting him twice or they go off.</v>

439
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Olga had managed to escape out onto the art.</v>

440
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>She was chased by Patricia Van Winkle who tackled her and then stabbed her to</v>

441
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:29.270
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

442
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>The only remaining victim was now Sharon tate as she lay on the lounge room</v>

443
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:37.010
<v Speaker 1>floor with a wraparound and actually begged to be able to live long enough to</v>

444
00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:37.844
<v Speaker 1>have a child,</v>

445
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>but a police were ignored and either Watkins or Atkins stabbed her repeatedly,</v>

446
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.730
<v Speaker 1>including in the abdomen until both she and her unborn baby would debt</v>

447
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 1>remembering Manson's instructions to leave a on the walls.</v>

448
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Atkins wrote the word pig with Tate's blood.</v>

449
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.533
<v Speaker 1>The very next day,</v>

450
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 1>the family struck again this time the victims were Leno and Rosemary Lablanca</v>

451
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>unhappy with the messiness of the previous night's killings.</v>

452
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

453
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Charlie went with the group to show them how it was done.</v>

454
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Different accounts have been given about the exact happenings that night,</v>

455
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that Madison was in the house and that he orchestrated the tying</v>

456
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:13.314
<v Speaker 1>up of the couple.</v>

457
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 1>He then left with the orders that the couple be killed before leaving the words</v>

458
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

459
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Rise.</v>

460
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Death to pigs and helter skelter were written with the blood of the victims on</v>

461
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 1>the walls and the refrigerator door.</v>

462
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.630
<v Speaker 1>The murders caused a huge panic.</v>

463
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's the pressure was now on to solve the heinous crimes.</v>

464
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.200
<v Speaker 1>The police got nowhere until they finally linked to the hinman merger to the</v>

465
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.490
<v Speaker 1>table of Blanca killings.</v>

466
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.450
<v Speaker 1>They knew that Bobby Beausoleil had lived with a group of hippies that spawn</v>

467
00:18:44.451 --> 00:18:44.901
<v Speaker 1>ranch,</v>

468
00:18:44.901 --> 00:18:46.910
<v Speaker 1>so they decided to pay the ranch and visits.</v>

469
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Bobby's girlfriend had told police that Charlie Manson,</v>

470
00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:50.324
<v Speaker 1>the hippy girl,</v>

471
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.830
<v Speaker 1>had ordered the killing of Henman.</v>

472
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

473
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.160
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence linking the group to the later murders.</v>

474
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.001
<v Speaker 1>Then in October,</v>

475
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:56.511
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>

476
00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Manson and family members,</v>

477
00:18:57.501 --> 00:18:58.340
<v Speaker 1>including Charlie,</v>

478
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.190
<v Speaker 1>were arrested on charges of arson and grand thefts.</v>

479
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Susan Atkins was also taken into custody and it was she who first began to spill</v>

480
00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:06.680
<v Speaker 1>the beans.</v>

481
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.080
<v Speaker 1>She brags do a cellmate about killing Sharon tate,</v>

482
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 1>giving a detailed accounts since implicating charlene as the masterminds about.</v>

483
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.851
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

484
00:19:13.851 --> 00:19:16.700
<v Speaker 1>police interviewed a member of the straight Satan's motorcycle gang,</v>

485
00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:17.960
<v Speaker 1>who was a madison acquaintance.</v>

486
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.100
<v Speaker 1>He told them the Manson had recently been bragging about knocking off five</v>

487
00:19:22.101 --> 00:19:22.640
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

488
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.610
<v Speaker 1>The first piece of physical evidence was the fingerprints of Patricia van</v>

489
00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:28.490
<v Speaker 1>winkled that was found on Sharon tate's bedroom door.</v>

490
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.920
<v Speaker 1>When other pieces of physical evidence were recovered,</v>

491
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 1>the police were ready to send the case to court Manson and the four people who</v>

492
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:38.330
<v Speaker 1>had committed the tate labianca murders were found guilty and sentenced to</v>

493
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:38.900
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

494
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.733
<v Speaker 1>These penalties,</v>

495
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.750
<v Speaker 1>however it would never be imposed.</v>

496
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.830
<v Speaker 1>In 1972,</v>

497
00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>the California Supreme Court declared the is death penalty law unconstitutional</v>

498
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Manson's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.</v>

499
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Charles Manson died on November the 19th,</v>

500
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>2017 of cardiac arrest,</v>

501
00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.050

502
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.510
