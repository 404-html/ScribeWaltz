<v Speaker 1>sweat.</v>

41
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I said Ira,</v>

42
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>who was also a teenager.</v>

43
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.750
<v Speaker 1>She gave birth to rep who though some years later said,</v>

44
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Arthur said,</v>

45
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>do you have remained living in the palace until the age of 29 and that was when</v>

46
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>everything changed according to the story.</v>

47
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>One day off that traveled outside of the palace gates and he was deeply</v>

48
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>disturbed by the site of an old man.</v>

49
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>His Cherry is here,</v>

50
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>China or explaining just the Dothan.</v>

51
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>There's all people grow old and die.</v>

52
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>The death is an integral part of life.</v>

53
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>This prompted Arthur secretly venture outside the palace on more and more trips.</v>

54
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>When leaving,</v>

55
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>it was said that the horses hooves well muffled by the gods,</v>

56
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 1>so it was to prevent the guards from knowing if his departure outside the gates.</v>

57
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>On these trips he encountered a sick man and they decay and Kolbes and a</v>

58
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>homeless only man,</v>

59
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>also known as an ascetic.</v>

60
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.960

61
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>physical pleasures.</v>

62
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Very higher spiritual purpose.</v>

63
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>After witnessing the reality of human hardship and suffering,</v>

<v Speaker 1>said author had no interest in living at the palace.</v>

65
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>He left his wife and child to discover the true meaning of life first by living</v>

66
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>as a traveling bag or like the aesthetics that he saw on the streets.</v>

67
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.601
<v Speaker 1>Is it off of us?</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was recognized dad by the king's men and he was offered the throne.</v>

72
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.280
<v Speaker 1>He rejected his promise to come back and visit it once he had attained</v>

73
00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:21.114
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

74

78
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Kalama taught Sid Arthur a form of meditation known as the sphere of</v>

79
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.613
<v Speaker 1>nothingness,</v>

80

<v Speaker 1>said Arthur eventually became his teachers.</v>

81
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Equal Kalama offered him his place saying,</v>

82
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you are the same as I am now.</v>

83
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.290
<v Speaker 1>There is no difference between us.</v>

84
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Stay here and take my place and teach my students with me,</v>

85
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's an author.</v>

86
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>He didn't stand in steady,</v>

87
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.990
<v Speaker 1>moved on to another teacher who darker Rammer pooter.</v>

88
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.621
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

89
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:53.700
<v Speaker 1>he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness and was asked to succeed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's an author,</v>

92
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>refused the offer once again and he moved on through the practice of meditation.</v>

93
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.810
<v Speaker 1>It's an Alpha realized eight state of perfect equanimity and awareness.</v>

94
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Auntie was on the path to enlightenment.</v>

95
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>He also realized that living life as an extremely deprived beggars he had done.</v>

96
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.233
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't working.</v>

97
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.300
<v Speaker 1>It had been six years and he had eaten very little and fostered until he was</v>

98
00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:16.134
<v Speaker 1>incredibly weak</v>

99
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.630
<v Speaker 1>off the starving himself for days.</v>

100
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Sit Off.</v>

101
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>That famously accepted Milken rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata.</v>

102
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.830
<v Speaker 1>He was so amazed.</v>

103
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>She thought he was a spirit,</v>

104
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 1>that to grant her a wish.</v>

105
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>So the author,</v>

106
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.640
<v Speaker 1>after having this meal decided against living the life of extreme self denial.</v>

107
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Since his spiritual goals,</v>

108
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>when not being mad,</v>

109
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.430
<v Speaker 1>he instead of opposite to follow a path of balance known in Buddhism as the</v>

110
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Middle Way.</v>

111
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>At this turning point is five followers believed he was giving up and they</v>

112
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.084
<v Speaker 1>abandoned him.</v>

113
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Soon after he began meditating under a fig tree and committed himself to staying</v>

114
00:04:57.781 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 1>there until he had found enlightenment.</v>

115
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>He meditated for six days and nights and reached enlightenment on the full moon.</v>

116
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Morning of May,</v>

117
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.430
<v Speaker 1>a week before he turned 35 at the time of his enlightenment,</v>

118
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 1>he gained complete insight into the cause of suffering and the steps necessary</v>

119
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 1>to eliminators.</v>

120
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>He called these steps,</v>

121
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.330
<v Speaker 1>the four noble truths after his awakening,</v>

122
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.710

125
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Leeka offered the Buddha his first meal after enlightenments and they became his</v>

126
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:30.270
<v Speaker 1>first later cycles.</v>

127
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>According to some tax.</v>

128
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>It's each of these brothers gave her hair and they were in shrine at a temple in</v>

129
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Rangoon,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Legend has it this initially,</v>

132
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 1>but I was reluctant to spread his knowledge.</v>

133
00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:57.024
<v Speaker 1>Do rather is this.</v>

134
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>He was doubtful of whether the common people would understand his teachings,</v>

135
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but then the king of Gods,</v>

136
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Brahma convinced Buddha to teach and that was what he set out to do.</v>

137
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha travel to deer park in northern India where he set in motion what</v>

138
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Buddhists call the wheel of Dharma by delivering his first sermon to the five</v>

139
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 1>companions who had abandoned him earlier together with him,</v>

140
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>they formed the first five Buddhist monks.</v>

141
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>All five attains nirvana or estate along the path to enlightenment.</v>

142
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

143
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>not full enlightenment.</v>

144
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>They were known as the ones who are worthy or perfected people from the first</v>

145
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>group of five.</v>

146
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It's steadily grew to 60 within the first few months,</v>

147
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>and eventually the song,</v>

148
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 1>how I reached more than 1000 people,</v>

149
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>the sign code traveled through the sub continent expounding the Dharma.</v>

150
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>This continued throughout the year except during the four months of the Vassar</v>

151
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled.</v>

152
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>One reason was that it was more difficult to do say without causing harm to</v>

153
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:53.054
<v Speaker 1>animal life.</v>

154
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>At this time of year,</v>

155
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>the Sangha would retreat to monasteries,</v>

156
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>public parks or forests where people would come to them.</v>

157
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>The first was sauna was spent at Veranasi when the Sangha was formed.</v>

158
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.691
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>

159
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:04.420
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha kept a promise to travel to Roger,</v>

160
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 1>got the capital of Megalodon to visit king than Besara.</v>

161
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.601
<v Speaker 1>During this visit,</v>

162
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Sarah put her in Maui Gallia.</v>

163
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Yana were converted to a psyche.</v>

164
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>One of the first five disciples.</v>

165
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.691
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>

166
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>they were to become the Buddhist to foremost followers.</v>

167
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.130
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Vella,</v>

168
00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Vanna Bamboo Grove monastery,</v>

169
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and Roger [inaudible],</v>

170
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>the capital of Magna Carta.</v>

171
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Upon hearing of his sons awakening,</v>

172
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>so to Hannah,</v>

173
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>sent over a period 10 delegations to ask him to return.</v>

174
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>On the first nine occasions,</v>

175
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.490
<v Speaker 1>the delegates fail to deliver the message and instead joins the sang herds</v>

176
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.201
<v Speaker 1>become era.</v>

177
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Hence the tents.</v>

178
00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Delegation led by color dye.</v>

179
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>He a childhood friend of [inaudible] who also became an [inaudible] offense,</v>

180
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

181
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>delivered the message now two years after his awakening,</v>

182
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha agreed to return and it's made a two month journey by first to</v>

183
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 1>capital of Vastu teaching of the Dahmer.</v>

184
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>As he went,</v>

185
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I just returned the royal palace,</v>

186
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>prepared a midday meal,</v>

187
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.620
<v Speaker 1>but the Sanger was making an alms rounds in capital Avastin hearing this,</v>

188
00:07:58.621 --> 00:07:58.841
<v Speaker 1>that whoa.</v>

189
00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Donna approached his son,</v>

190
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.063
<v Speaker 1>but her saying,</v>

191
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 1>how's the warrior lineage of Muhammad Sata and not a single warrior has gone</v>

192
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>seeking arms.</v>

193
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha is said to have replied that it's not the custom of your royal</v>

194
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>lineage,</v>

195
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but it is the custom of my Buddha lineage.</v>

196
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking arms.</v>

197
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist texts say that suited honor invited the Sangha.</v>

198
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I rented the palace for the meal,</v>

199
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 1>followed by a Dharma talk.</v>

200
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.780
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>

201
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>he has said to have become a sought out partner during the visit.</v>

202
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Many members of the royal family join the Sangha,</v>

203
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhist cousins and Nada and a new radar became too if it's five chief</v>

204
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>disciples at the age of seven his son Rahula also joins and became one of his 10</v>

205
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 1>chief disciples.</v>

206
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 1>His half brother,</v>

207
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Nanda also joined and became an error hands.</v>

208
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 1>His wife reportedly became a nun throughout his life,</v>

209
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 1>but it encourages students to question his teachings and confirmed them through</v>

210
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 1>their own experience.</v>

211
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 1>This non dogmatic attitude still characterizes Buddhism today.</v>

212
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism is the fourth largest religion in the world and it is also one of the</v>

213
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>oldest established in the sixth century BC in Present Day Nepal,</v>

214
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

215
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other religions,</v>

216
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Buddhists do not worship a god.</v>

217
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:17.941
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

218
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>they focus on spiritual developments with the end goal of becoming enlightened,</v>

219
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>though not in the intellectual sense of the word in the Western world's</v>

220
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is most often associated with the 18th century European</v>

221
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:30.570
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment period.</v>

222
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Movements characterized by a rational and scientific approach to politics,</v>

223
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

224
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and social and economic issues.</v>

225
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.371
<v Speaker 1>In Buddhism,</v>

226
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>the simplest explanation of attaining enlightenment is when an individual finds</v>

227
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>out the truth about life and experiences and awakening.</v>

228
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Where they are freed from the cycle of being reborn.</v>

229
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Central to Buddhism is the notion that to live is to suffer and everything is in</v>

230
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 1>a constant state of change.</v>

231
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.330
<v Speaker 1>All Buddhists believe unless one has become enlightened,</v>

232
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.480
<v Speaker 1>they will be reincarnated again and to gain four principles that the Buddha came</v>

233
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 1>to understand during his meditation under the Bodhi Tree,</v>

234
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 1>these are the truth of suffering.</v>

235
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Ducati,</v>

236
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>the truth of origin,</v>

237
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>of suffering.</v>

238
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Daya the truth of cessation of suffering and they're a ta and the truth of</v>

239
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>the path of cessation of suffering.</v>

240
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Maga suffering comes in many forms.</v>

241
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Three obvious kinds are suffering corresponding to the first three sides,</v>

242
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhist soreness,</v>

243
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>first journey outside his palace,</v>

244
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.793
<v Speaker 1>old age,</v>

245
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 1>sickness and death.</v>

246
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:27.780
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha,</v>

247
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the problem of suffering goes much deeper though life is not ideal if frequently</v>

248
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 1>fails to live up to our expectations,</v>

249
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.101
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

250
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 1>all subjects to desires and cravings,</v>

251
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>but even when we are able to satisfy these desires,</v>

252
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction is only temporary.</v>

253
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure does not last,</v>

254
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>and if it does,</v>

255
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 1>it becomes monotonous.</v>

256
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Even when we are not suffering from outward causes like illness or Bereavements,</v>

257
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>we are unfulfilled or unsatisfied.</v>

258
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.230
<v Speaker 1>This is simply the truth of suffering.</v>

259
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>The next [inaudible] truth is the origin of suffering,</v>

260
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 1>not day to day troubles may seem to have easily identifiable causes.</v>

261
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.250
<v Speaker 1>First painted them and injuries.</v>

262
00:11:03.251 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Sadness from the loss of a loved one in the second of his noble truths though,</v>

263
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 1>but a claimed to have found the cause of all suffering and it is much more</v>

264
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 1>deeply rooted than our immediate worries.</v>

265
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.660
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha taught that the root of all suffering is desire.</v>

266
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Tanya,</v>

267
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>this comes in three forms which he describes as the three roots of evil or the</v>

268
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>three fires or the three poisons.</v>

269
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.320
<v Speaker 1>The three roots of evil are greed and desire.</v>

270
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Representatives in ours by a Rasta ignorance or delusion represented by a pig</v>

271
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>and hatred and destructive urges represented by a snake.</v>

272
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 1>The third noble truth is the cessation of suffering,</v>

273
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.410
<v Speaker 1>and I wrote her,</v>

274
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha taught that the way to extinguish desire,</v>

275
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 1>which causes suffering is to liberate oneself from attachments.</v>

276
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the third noble truth,</v>

277
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of liberation.</v>

278
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha was a living example of that.</v>

279
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>This is possible in the human lifetime.</v>

280
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Estrangement here means disenchantment or Buddhist things to no sense conditions</v>

281
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>clearly as they are without becoming in Sean's head or misled by them.</v>

282
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Nirvana means extinguishing.</v>

283
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Attaining Nirvana.</v>

284
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Reaching enlightenment means extinguishing the three fires of greed,</v>

285
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>delusion and hatred.</v>

286
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Someone who reaches Nirvana does not immediately disappear to a heavenly realm.</v>

287
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Nirvana is better understood as the state of minds that humans can reach.</v>

288
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 1>It is a state of profound spiritual joy with our negative emotions and fears.</v>

289
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Someone who has attained enlightenment is filled with compassion for all living</v>

290
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 1>things after death and enlightened person is liberated from the cycle of</v>

291
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>rebirth,</v>

292
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>but Buddhism gives him no definitely balances as to what happens next.</v>

293
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>The Buddha discouraged his followers from asking too many questions about</v>

294
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Nirvana.</v>

295
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.430
<v Speaker 1>He wanted them to concentrate on the task at hand,</v>

296
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 1>which was freeing themselves from the cycle of suffering,</v>

297
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 1>asking questions.</v>

298
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like quibbling with the doctor.</v>

299
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to save your life.</v>

300
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 1>The fourth noble truth is the path to the cessation of suffering Maga.</v>

301
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>This final noble truth is the Buddhist prescription.</v>

302
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>For the end of suffering.</v>

303
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>This is a set of principles calls the eight fold path.</v>

304
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.970
<v Speaker 1>The eightfold path is also called the middle way.</v>

305
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It avoids both indulgence and Sverre asceticism,</v>

306
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 1>either of which the Buddha found helpful in his search for enlightenment.</v>

307
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.330
<v Speaker 1>The age stages are not to be taken in order,</v>

308
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but rather support and reinforce each other.</v>

309
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 1>At the age of 18 bitter announced that he would soon reach Perry,</v>

310
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:37.040
<v Speaker 1>nirvana,</v>

311
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Raleigh,</v>

312
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.990
<v Speaker 1>final deathless state,</v>

313
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.590
<v Speaker 1>and abandon his earthly body.</v>

314
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.311
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>

315
00:13:41.311 --> 00:13:42.810
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha ate his last meal,</v>

316
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.840
<v Speaker 1>which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named couldn't dot</v>

317
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.411
<v Speaker 1>holding,</v>

00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:50.790
<v Speaker 1>violently ill bitter instructed his attendance and Nada to convince Kunda the</v>

319
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:54.990
<v Speaker 1>meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal</v>

320
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.110
<v Speaker 1>would be a source of the greatest Maris as it providers.</v>

321
00:13:58.111 --> 00:13:59.460
<v Speaker 1>The last meal for a Buddha,</v>

322
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.821
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha,</v>

323

325
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>way or another,</v>
