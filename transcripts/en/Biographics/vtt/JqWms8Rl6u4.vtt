<v Speaker 1>Jane's father enlisted and was posted to France.</v>

28
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>From then on,</v>

29
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>he would become a distant figure in Jane's life only.</v>

30
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Rarely coming home when he was on leave after the allies declared victory in the</v>

31
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>war was over.</v>

32
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>The good old marriage ended in divorce a few years before Jane must have known</v>

33
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.913
<v Speaker 1>it was coming.</v>

34
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>The youngster wrote a heartfelt letter to her father,</v>

35
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>pleading him to wait until she was 12 years old.</v>

36
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>The divorce of Jane's parents,</v>

37
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>method of greater impacts on her if her mother hadn't been such an influential</v>

38
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and supportive parents.</v>

39
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Jane says it was her mother primarily.</v>

40
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>This encouraged her to live out our passions,</v>

41
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

42
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Jane,</v>

43
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>if you really want something and if you work hard,</v>

44
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of opportunities,</v>

45
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>never give up.</v>

46
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>You will somehow find a way.</v>

47
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Speaker 1>My mother would later play a role in Jane's early career,</v>

48
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>traveling with Jane and staying on the camp,</v>

49
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>but the Gombe Reserve.</v>

50
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Jane spent the majority of her childhood growing up in her maternal</v>

51
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>grandmother's 18,</v>

53
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

54
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>They had a yard with a garden and trees were.</v>

55
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Jane spent most of her free time surrounded by women.</v>

56
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Jane shared the residents with her mother,</v>

57
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>sister,</v>

58
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.201
<v Speaker 1>grandmother,</v>

59
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:04.034
<v Speaker 1>and two aunts.</v>

60
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a happy home and a place good old now in her eighties,</v>

61
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>goes back to when she needs to relax and recharge.</v>

62
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>She says all my childhood books,</v>

63
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:11.751
<v Speaker 1>the trees.</v>

64
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I climbed as a trials,</v>

65
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>the cliffs where I walked.</v>

66
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm blessed in this way.</v>

67
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Young Jane Develops in early fascination with wild animals.</v>

68
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Just over a year old Jane's father,</v>

69
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>gifted tyree lifelike,</v>

70
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:26.941
<v Speaker 1>three foot tall,</v>

71
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>stuffed chimpanzee that she affectionately named jubilee and carried around with</v>

72
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:32.124
<v Speaker 1>her everywhere.</v>

73
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Jane's Mother's friends were quite horrified by the toy chimpanzee fairing.</v>

74
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>It would give the young toddler nightmare.</v>

75
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's quite the opposite,</v>

76
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

77
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Jane loved the toy and she still has it.</v>

78
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Over 80 years later being that Jane devoted her life to researching and saving</v>

79
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

80
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the only gift of stuffs chimpanzee seems like the ultimate foreshadowing,</v>

81
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>but Jane admits she is keen on all animals and would have studied and other</v>

82
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>species if the circumstances had been different.</v>

83
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

84
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>as a go,</v>

85
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Jane did not limit herself to learning about just one kind of animal.</v>

86
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Jane would often be outside the family home and the yard quietly observing,</v>

87
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>sketching or writing notes about birds and other creatures have.</v>

88
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Family had a host of pets,</v>

89
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>including a tortoise and the dog and the young Jane,</v>

90
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>so can many more including racing snails,</v>

91
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>caterpillars,</v>

92
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the lizard and the canary.</v>

93
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Jane was an avid reader to some of her favorite books included Dr doolittle.</v>

94
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Tarzan in the jungle book.</v>

95
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Reading these books ignited a desire to go to Africa someday to observe and to</v>

96
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>write about wild animals.</v>

97
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Jane was also a curious and patient young step once when Jane was five years</v>

98
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

99
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.020
<v Speaker 1>her parents could not find her errands,</v>

100
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.863
<v Speaker 1>presumed to missing.</v>

101
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>As panic ensued in search began.</v>

102
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>It turns out to Jane had been sitting in the hen house waiting for the chickens</v>

103
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:40.864
<v Speaker 1>to lay eggs.</v>

104
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>This quiet observation and persistence is the hallmark of our good old would</v>

105
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>later conductor research at gone best stream.</v>

106
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>While Jane entertains fanciful thoughts of Africa and long to be outside in</v>

107
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

108
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>she was still a young.</v>

109
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm enrolled at the uplands private school.</v>

110
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>By all accounts.</v>

111
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>She was a good students,</v>

112
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but felt the routine of the classroom unbearable.</v>

113
00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>At 16,</v>

114
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>she confided in her diary writing,</v>

115
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>woke up to be faced by yet another dreary day of torture,</v>

116
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that gloomy place of discipline and learning where one is stuffed with education</v>

117
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>from days dorn today's Eve,</v>

118
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>despite these feelings that she managed to embrace us school studies and</v>

119
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>finished strong focusing her interests in biology and English.</v>

120
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>She even won two prizes for essay writing in 1953 and at the urging of her</v>

121
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>mother Jane and in the London's Queen Secretarial College and graduated one year</v>

122
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>later after receiving a qualification,</v>

123
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Jane held clerical jobs in Bournemouth and Oxford University.</v>

124
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>She also sometimes waited tables and took a part time job with a film company</v>

125
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

126
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Jane never gave up on her dream of going to Africa even if the idea seemed far</v>

127
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.563
<v Speaker 1>fetched.</v>

128
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>In 1955,</v>

129
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall received a letter from Khloe and old school friends with an</v>

130
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>invitation to come to Kenya.</v>

131
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>The day had finally come.</v>

132
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>It was the opportunity that she had been waiting for.</v>

133
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>She saved hard for the fair and in March of 1957,</v>

<v Speaker 1>embarks on a three week journey by ship.</v>

135
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Soon after arriving in Kenya,</v>

136
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Jane took a job in the capital city of Nairobi and demands of the famous British</v>

143
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>He was motivated to find the missing link and we're searching for just the right</v>

144
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>person to study primates in the wild rather than in captivity.</v>

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Researcher vapes in their natural habitat has not been carried out before in</v>

146
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>this manner and leaky soar in Jane,</v>

147
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the perfect candidate to conduct the study not only need to Jane exhibit the</v>

148
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm he was looking for,</v>

149
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>but she also had the temperament to sustain long periods of time in the African</v>

150
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Bush with a mind,</v>

151
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>uncluttered and unbiased by theory.</v>

152
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Up until this time,</v>

153
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>good old has no formal scientific training or academic credentials that</v>

154
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>qualified her to conduct such a study.</v>

155
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention women scientists who are practically unheard during the 19</v>

156
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>fifties and sixties.</v>

157
00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

158
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Blakey took a chance on the young woman first hiring her as a secretary and then</v>

159
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.930
<v Speaker 1>sending out to the Gulf stream reserve in Tanzania in 1960.</v>

160
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Jane was on her phd later in 1965 from Cambridge University.</v>

161
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>The degree it would earn Jane respect to the fields and an hour to receive</v>

162
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>funding for research</v>

163
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>in 1968 at the age of 26 Jane Google Inbox for the gun best dream reserve now</v>

164
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>part of the Gombe National Park in Tanzania,</v>

165
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Uganda is bordered by the longest lake in the world,</v>

166
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Lake Tanganyika in the Goma region of the country in 1960.</v>

167
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>When Jane began her research,</v>

168
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>the forests have gumbo the parts of a continuous chain throughout Burundi,</v>

169
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda and Uganda and scratched Westwood's toothy Great Congo Basin.</v>

170
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Jane's destination was only accessible by boat and as the land was characterized</v>

171
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>by steep valleys and lush green rain forests,</v>

172
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>the African Bush and waters were alive with many species of wildlife,</v>

173
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 1>birds and fish today and remains one of the best places on earth to observe</v>

174
00:06:57.321 --> 00:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>primates in their natural habitat.</v>

175
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Goodwill's mission was to learn everything she possibly could about the wild</v>

176
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.873
<v Speaker 1>Arlene gone back.</v>

178
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Her mother accompanies her on the trip for the first few months.</v>

179
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>The local authorities believing a young British woman would never survive alone</v>

180
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:11.954
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness.</v>

181
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Bops labeled right though the dangers of nature were less of a concern at the</v>

182
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:16.930
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

183
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Civil war in the Congo had flooded with refugees for several weeks.</v>

184
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Jane,</v>

185
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>her mother runs one.</v>

186
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Kirk were forbidden to travel to the stream and waited out the conflict in a</v>

187
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>prison camp until it was safe.</v>

188
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

189
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>thinking back on her first Dang gone bear.</v>

190
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Jane recalls looking up from the shore to the forest,</v>

191
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 1>hindering the apes and the birds and smelling the plants.</v>

192
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking it was very,</v>

193
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>very unreal.</v>

194
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Jane's early attempts at getting close to chimpanzees failed.</v>

195
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>She could get no closer than 500 yards.</v>

196
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>She found another trip and established a pattern of consistent observation by</v>

197
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 1>appearing in the same spot each morning along the stream near the chimps feeding</v>

198
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

199
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>It was one male chimpanzee who allowed Jane within close range.</v>

200
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>She tempted him with your banana and named him David,</v>

201
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 1>graded for his white tufted chin.</v>

202
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Once does allow Jane to get close and to watch him.</v>

203
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Other members of the group started to feel comfortable and accept our presence.</v>

204
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>No other human up until now had ever gotten so close to chimpanzees in the wild.</v>

205
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>It would take two years for the chimps to show no fear of her and she was</v>

206
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>allowed to observe them almost as if she was a chimp self.</v>

207
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Jane imitated them,</v>

208
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>eat their foods and spend time in the trees.</v>

209
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>She would become closely acquainted with over half of the 100 or so chimps in</v>

210
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>the reserve.</v>

211
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Much of the horror of some scientists,</v>

212
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Jane gave all the chimps names like flow,</v>

213
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:30.411
<v Speaker 1>Fifi,</v>

214
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Flynn's and Mr Greg Hall at this time.</v>

215
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>One was careful not to give human characteristics to animals for fear of</v>

216
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 1>engaging in anthropomorphism.</v>

217
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Researchers tended to use numbers instead,</v>

218
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>good old would later recall,</v>

219
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>these people were trying to make ufology a hard science,</v>

220
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>so they objected.</v>

221
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Choirs unpleasantly to my naming,</v>

222
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>my subject sand for suggesting that they have personalities,</v>

223
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>

224
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.013
<v Speaker 1>and feelings.</v>

225
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Critics aside,</v>

226
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Jane continued to practice.</v>

227
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>She believed that empathy was the key to detecting slight changes in mood or</v>

228
00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>attitude,</v>

229
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>and those changes could provide insights into complex social processes.</v>

230
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Within weeks had gone bad,</v>

231
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Jane was making new discoveries in turning conventional thought on its hat,</v>

232
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.160
<v Speaker 1>making tools and using tools was thought to be an exclusive traits of humans and</v>

233
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:16.994
<v Speaker 1>not animals.</v>

234
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

235
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Jane witness David graded using a blade of grass to extract termites from a</v>

236
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.940
<v Speaker 1>mountain stands on another occasion.</v>

237
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.270
<v Speaker 1>He stripped leaves from a twig to gain better access to his prey.</v>

238
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>This was the first recorded time in history that another species how to used or</v>

239
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.300
<v Speaker 1>modifying tools leaky.</v>

240
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.260
<v Speaker 1>It was so excited.</v>

241
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>He famously exclaimed,</v>

242
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.080
<v Speaker 1>we must now redefined man redefined tool or accepts chimpanzees as human.</v>

243
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He was surely exaggerating,</v>

244
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:44.840
<v Speaker 1>but the discovery was a major blow to the notion of man the toolmaker.</v>

245
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.850
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks after the toolmaking revelation,</v>

246
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Jane observed David [inaudible] eating what looks like a piece of meat.</v>

247
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.340
<v Speaker 1>It was a piglets,</v>

248
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.070
<v Speaker 1>and so the long held theory of primates as strictly vegetarians swelled.</v>

249
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>That was also debunked through Jane's observations,</v>

250
00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>the world would also learn chimps,</v>

251
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:01.420
<v Speaker 1>engaging cannibalism and warfare.</v>

252
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Jane witnessed a brutal four year war with a neighboring tribe that devastated</v>

253
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the chimps.</v>

254
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.370
<v Speaker 1>MAILCHIMP's also routinely patrol the borders of their territory and will attack</v>

255
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:14.210
<v Speaker 1>a solitary male chimpanzee from another tribe in order to protect their area.</v>

256
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.790
<v Speaker 1>This dark side of chimpanzee behavior,</v>

257
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall likened to gang activity living amongst the primates.</v>

258
00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Jane observed that chimpanzees have complex brains and social systems.</v>

259
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>The caste system of chimpanzee society places the dominant male at the top,</v>

260
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>which is often ranked by how intense his performances at feedings.</v>

261
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Over the course of her research,</v>

262
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Jane discovered chimps to develop long term bonds with each other have</v>

263
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:42.440
<v Speaker 1>ritualized behaviors and even a primitive language with 20 unique sounds.</v>

264
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees possessed individual personalities and communicate through touch and</v>

265
00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:47.264
<v Speaker 1>body language.</v>

266
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.950
<v Speaker 1>They kiss and embrace each other,</v>

267
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 1>give pats on the back,</v>

268
00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>shake their fists,</v>

269
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:54.320
<v Speaker 1>and engage in a whole variety of other nonverbal ways.</v>

270
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Jay noted the males do not play an active role in the family.</v>

271
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 1>This is simply left up to the females.</v>

272
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Jane observed the strong bond in the mother child relationship and it's found</v>

273
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:05.390
<v Speaker 1>that maternal instincts are taught not inherent.</v>

274
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees learn through observation,</v>

275
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 1>imitation,</v>

276
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.900
<v Speaker 1>and practice the chimpanzees with good mothers who were above all else</v>

277
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.720
<v Speaker 1>supportive ended up being good mothers themselves.</v>

278
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.650
<v Speaker 1>The ones who were poor ended up having female offspring that was also poor,</v>

279
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.820
<v Speaker 1>mothering Jane even theorize that chimps may have a sense of self and perhaps a</v>

280
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:23.870
<v Speaker 1>spiritual connection.</v>

281

<v Speaker 1>How research concluded that mother centric groupings along with sex,</v>

282
00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:31.790
<v Speaker 1>food sharing and grieving all the essential components of chimpanzee society.</v>

283
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Good old publication.</v>

284
00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:34.370
<v Speaker 1>The chimpanzees have gone bad.</v>

285
00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Patterns of behavior is the definitive work on the behavior of chimpanzees.</v>

286
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.410
<v Speaker 1>It would have become the core body of work used to establish chimps,</v>

287
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 1>gorillas,</v>

288
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.810
<v Speaker 1>and had been as hominids.</v>

289
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>The only discoveries of toolmaking and meat eating chips and the idea of young</v>

290
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>woman living in the jungle caught the interest of national geographic and in</v>

291
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:02.131
<v Speaker 1>1962 they sent it to the dashing Dutch photographer Baron Hugo Evon Loueke to</v>

292
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>film her work,</v>

293
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 1>fell in love while on assignments,</v>

294
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>and as they were in 1960 for three years later,</v>

295
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 1>they had their son,</v>

296
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.663
<v Speaker 1>you go junior,</v>

297
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.450
<v Speaker 1>who she called Grub life,</v>

298
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>seemed idyllic for Jane,</v>

299
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 1>doing what she loved most,</v>

300
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 1>being with and writing about chimpanzees and that were expelled.</v>

301
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>This good old lens,</v>

302
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>the wild chimpanzees ad in 1965 and thrust Jane under the spotlight and that</v>

303
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>same year Jane received her phd from Cambridge even though it was his idea and</v>

304
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>he pushed Jane to pursue her doctorate.</v>

305
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.960
<v Speaker 1>She acknowledged it was important saying that Cambridge taught me to think in a</v>

306
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 1>scientific way so I could stand up to people.</v>

307
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>It taught me to think logically.</v>

308
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I loved it and I loved analyzing the data.</v>

309
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a very important part of my development.</v>

310
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Jane and Hugo's marriage lasted a decade and my 1974,</v>

311
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the pack called it quits.</v>

312
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>They remained on good terms.</v>

313
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 1>She had married Derick Bryson member of Tanzania and parliaments and director of</v>

314
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania national parks the following year.</v>

315
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>They had five good years together until his death in 1980 from cancer.</v>

316
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Jane was devastated by the loss,</v>

317
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but she came to terms with us.</v>

318
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I went to Columbia and the forest is very healing.</v>

319
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.970
<v Speaker 1>You get this endless cycle of living and dying and things fell into perspective.</v>

320
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>In 1971,</v>

321
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall published one of our most popular and well known books in the</v>

322
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:12.604
<v Speaker 1>shadow of man.</v>

323
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 1>A vivid description has brought the chimps to life and bridged the gap between</v>

324
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 1>science and entertainments.</v>

325
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Jane published many more books after she able to professorship at Stanford</v>

326
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>University and was appointed honorary visiting professor of sociology at the</v>

327
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.</v>

328
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>In 1977,</v>

329
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Dr Goodall founded the Jane Goodall Institute,</v>

330
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Jay g,</v>

331
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I with a mission to protect the chimpanzees and further the research had gone</v>

332
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

333
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>These soft spoken Jane seems and unlikely celebrity,</v>

334
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 1>but she would find her academic respectability and its popularity and advantage</v>

335
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 1>when speaking on behalf of the chimps that she so loved over the course of our</v>

336
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:46.891
<v Speaker 1>research at gone,</v>

337
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 1>bears became increasingly clear that the wildlife there,</v>

338
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>including the chimpanzees,</v>

339
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 1>were at significant risk.</v>

340
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:52.661
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

341
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>by the 19 eighties,</v>

342
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees were an endangered species.</v>

343
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Their home and resources were being destroyed at an alarming rate.</v>

344
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 1>After attending a conference organized by the Chicago Academy of Sciences in</v>

345
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 1>1986 to coincide with the publication of the chimpanzees have Gumbo.</v>

346
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Goodwill found herself at a turning point at 52 years old sounds.</v>

347
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 1>After 25 years of field research,</v>

348
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Jane wins on the road to educate the public on the vanishing habitats,</v>

349
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 1>the bushmeat trade,</v>

350
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 1>animal trafficking,</v>

351
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and the unethical treatment of animals used in modern medicine and for</v>

352
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 1>scientific research.</v>

353
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.471
<v Speaker 1>In 1990,</v>

354
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 1>the revelation came that Jane must turn her attention to humans in order to save</v>

355
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.650
<v Speaker 1>her chimps.</v>

356
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.640
<v Speaker 1>While flying over gone there,</v>

357
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 1>she saw the hill stripped bare.</v>

358
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:31.980
<v Speaker 1>By deforestation,</v>

359
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.410
<v Speaker 1>the local villagers were responsible having over farmed their lands.</v>

360
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>We've listed options left,</v>

361
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>they'd taken the trees and the national park to sell his timber in order to</v>

362
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>

363
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 1>At that moment,</v>

364
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Jane realized that unless you address poverty and to work to improve the lives</v>

365
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>of villages,</v>

366
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.530
<v Speaker 1>you can never expect to conserve the lands and save the wildlife.</v>

367
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>She explained everything is interconnected.</v>

368
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.850
<v Speaker 1>You learn that in the rainforest.</v>

369
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Soon off to the Jgi launched programs focused on education,</v>

370
00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.211

373
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 1>and microcredit for women.</v>

374
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:07.341
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to,</v>

378
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 1>The Gomberg chimps now have three to four times more forest than they had 10</v>

379
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 1>also known as xenotransplantation.</v>

385
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Further goodall has made strides to phase out the use of chimpanzees and medical</v>

<v Speaker 1>remember our connection to nature and what we leave behind.</v>

450
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.760

<v Speaker 1>I have three grandchildren.</v>

452
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I think about their children.</v>

453
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>If we can't do things differently,</v>

454
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 1>what is the world going to be like in 50 years?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Above all else,</v>

456
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Jane has taught us that it is up to us to make a change.</v>

457
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Every individual matters.</v>

458
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Every individual has a role to play.</v>

459
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Every individual makes a difference.</v>

460
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 1>Only if we understand what we care.</v>

461
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Only if we can.</v>

462
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.383
<v Speaker 1>Where we help?</v>

463
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Only if we help shall we will be saved.</v>

464
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The least I can do is speak out for those who cannot speak out for themselves.</v>
