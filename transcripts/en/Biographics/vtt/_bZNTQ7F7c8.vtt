00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>My Japanese pronunciation is not brilliant,</v>

7
00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>so bear with me in this video.</v>

8
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I have a computer here.</v>

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking up the stuff when I can.</v>

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I fail.</v>

<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

13
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>During World War Two,</v>

14
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>in the second Seleno,</v>

15
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Japanese war dogs named Shiro issue was responsible for creating biological</v>

16
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>weapons of mass destruction is she built a laboratory in Manchuria cooled unit</v>

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>7:31 on behalf of the Japanese government's.</v>

18
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Its goal was to create a weapon so deadly.</v>

19
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>It could wipe out the population of Japan's enemies.</v>

20
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>He used nibbling Chinese villages as as human Guinea pigs for these bundled</v>

21
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>trickle weapons and experimented on men,</v>

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.333
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

23
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>and even children.</v>

24
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.351
<v Speaker 1>When the war was over,</v>

25
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the United States learned about Shiro Ishii sadistic experiments.</v>

26
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>While many of the Nazis were sentenced to death for that crimes against</v>

27
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:00.911
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

28
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>And Europe's concentration camps,</v>

29
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Shero issue was allowed to go free.</v>

30
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So what would drive someone to become one of the most evil men in history and</v>

31
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>why on earth we see it,</v>

32
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I have to get away with mass murder.</v>

33
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're looking at in this week's by graphics.</v>

35
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Shiro Ishii was born in 1892 in a village called Shitty Yama in the Chiba</v>

36
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Prefecture of Japan.</v>

37
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>His parents were wealthy landowners that came from a long line of Daimyos or</v>

38
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>feudal lords,</v>

39
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>who owns the most land in any given area.</v>

40
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese system of prefectures or states have only just begun in the 1870.</v>

41
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 1>So his parents were very powerful and still had a lot of control over the</v>

42
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>government and the Chiba Prefecture.</v>

43
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.171
<v Speaker 1>Throughout history,</v>

44
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>these wealthy landowners benefited from indentured servants who farms the fields</v>

45
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't able to enjoy a lavish lifestyle even into the 19th century.</v>

46
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>These descendants of the dime year,</v>

47
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>we're still very much benefiting from their family's fortunes.</v>

48
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.061
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

49
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese people looked up to the emperor of Japan with a godlike admiration,</v>

50
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>even though they logically knew the imperial family were mortals,</v>

51
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>they still had a very strong sense of loyalty and they believe that the life of</v>

52
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>someone living in the lower class was truly not as valuable as someone from the</v>

53
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:25.514
<v Speaker 1>optic loss.</v>

54
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Because of this Japanese mindset share real issue was raised to believe that he</v>

55
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:34.151
<v Speaker 1>truly was far more important than most people know much else is known about his</v>

56
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.941
<v Speaker 1>younger years.</v>

57
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Except to say that it would seem like his path seems very linear.</v>

58
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>It is almost as if all of his life experiences were preparing him to experiment</v>

59
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>on human beings without any sense of remorse.</v>

60
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.201
<v Speaker 1>Sure is.</v>

61
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>She studied medicine it Kyoto,</v>

62
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>imperial university,</v>

63
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't interested in becoming a doctor who heals the common people in a</v>

64
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>

65
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>He became a surgeon for the Imperial Japanese army in 1920.</v>

66
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>One earns the rank of leftenant.</v>

67
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.140
<v Speaker 1>His superiors were impressed with his surgical skill,</v>

68
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>so they sent him to the army medical school in Tokyo for further training.</v>

69
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.440
<v Speaker 1>They also paid for him to start doing a postgraduate medicine program at Kyo to</v>

70
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>imperial university,</v>

71
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>even though he did become a medical doctor,</v>

72
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.171
<v Speaker 1>like we said,</v>

73
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't interested in healing.</v>

74
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Patients was far more fascinated with studying and experimentation.</v>

75
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>You had a particular love of biology and particularly bacteria.</v>

76
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It used to grow deadly bacteria in petri dishes and he called them his pets in</v>

77
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>the 1920.</v>

78
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] finished his many years of medical school and went on a two year</v>

79
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>trip around the world to visit 30 countries.</v>

80
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>He was particularly fascinated with staying in Germany so that he could study</v>

81
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>the poison gasses that that romy used during World War One.</v>

82
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Chlorine gas had been used as a weapon of war,</v>

83
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>but both sides began to use gas masks.</v>

84
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>As far as she was concerned,</v>

85
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>gas was no longer an effective means of killing another soldier.</v>

86
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.790
<v Speaker 1>In 1931,</v>

87
00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:06.080
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese territory of Manchuria was taken over by Japan during these seconds.</v>

88
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Sino Japanese war,</v>

89
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.240
<v Speaker 1>and this was a huge victory for Japan and they were already occupying Korea.</v>

90
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.650
<v Speaker 1>They were feeling very confident that they could spread this embar to conquer</v>

91
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>the entire rest of China.</v>

92
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.321
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

93
00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 1>if she saw this new Manchurian territory is a perfect opportunity for him to</v>

94
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:26.810
<v Speaker 1>take his theoretical ideas of biological weapons and make them into a</v>

95
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:28.100
<v Speaker 1>devastating reality,</v>

96
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.530
<v Speaker 1>just like an evil villain in a bond movie.</v>

97
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:35.510
<v Speaker 1>He was searching for a plague that was capable of wiping out the entire human</v>

98
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:39.050
<v Speaker 1>race or at least the enemies of the Japanese empire.</v>

99
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

100
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.730
<v Speaker 1>surely she had such a powerful position in the military and government that he</v>

101
00:04:43.731 --> 00:04:48.200
<v Speaker 1>was able to personally approach the emperor and request the funding to create an</v>

102
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary in Manchuria.</v>

103
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Off to that permission was granted.</v>

104
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.440
<v Speaker 1>He built a massive compounds called unit 7:31.</v>

105
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.880
<v Speaker 1>It was officially called the epidemic prevention in water supply unit because</v>

106
00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:03.350
<v Speaker 1>its true purpose of studying biological weapons was supposed to remain a secret.</v>

107
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 1>They were given a huge budget which they spent on state of the art equipment</v>

108
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.200
<v Speaker 1>unit 7:31 was similar to a Nazi concentration camp and that it was an entire</v>

109
00:05:12.201 --> 00:05:14.870
<v Speaker 1>campus of buildings which included holding cells,</v>

110
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 1>medical facilities,</v>

111
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 1>and a gigantic crematorium.</v>

112
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.830
<v Speaker 1>The administration building where she worked with so strong,</v>

113
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it was the last building left standing after being bombed.</v>

114
00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:25.341
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

115
00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:26.060
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

116
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.440
<v Speaker 1>but of course you can't have human experimentation without test subjects.</v>

117
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.420
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese can pace on military.</v>

118
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Police would grab it,</v>

119
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Chinese people off the streets of their villages on arrest them.</v>

120
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.100
<v Speaker 1>They were put on trains that arrived at unit 7:31,</v>

121
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:42.590
<v Speaker 1>and they were never allowed to see their families again.</v>

122
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 1>They captured all ages of men,</v>

123
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.781
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

124
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>and even young children because they wanted to see how these weapons affected</v>

125
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.120
<v Speaker 1>all types of people.</v>

126
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Speaker 1>According to the military doctors who worked there,</v>

127
00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>they were forced to work at unit seven,</v>

128
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>31 without really even knowing what they're getting themselves into.</v>

129
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.431
<v Speaker 1>Upon arrival,</v>

130
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>they would find doctors,</v>

131
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>injecting Chinese people with a deadly disease like anthrax or you'd be</v>

132
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.603
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck plague.</v>

133
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>If they spoke out against the experiments.</v>

134
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>It would be treason and they could be executed for us,</v>

135
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>for those who were forced to work in unit seven,</v>

136
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 1>31,</v>

137
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 1>they had to believe that this was all just a part of war and killing the</v>

138
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>civilians was no different than bombing an enemy country.</v>

139
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

140
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>they believed that their actions were far more noble than the average soldier</v>

141
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>because they killed in the name of science.</v>

142
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Doctors would dissect human beings while they were still alive without using any</v>

143
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.084
<v Speaker 1>anesthetic.</v>

144
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to see what organs look like while they were still functioning and</v>

145
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>to learn exactly how the disease would cause these organs to fail.</v>

146
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Some of the subjects were given a vaccine to the plague first before exposing</v>

147
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 1>them to the disease.</v>

148
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.841
<v Speaker 1>This way,</v>

149
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>they were able to know exactly what the strongest vaccines were for the</v>

150
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>deadliest diseases in the wells.</v>

151
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Once they affected the formula,</v>

152
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>they were able to create enough antidotes for all of Japan in this way.</v>

153
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Unit 7:31 was making breakthroughs and modern medicine,</v>

154
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was at the expense of a great many Chinese lives.</v>

155
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.751
<v Speaker 1>They're holding cells.</v>

156
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>They were large enough that they could hold up to 600 people at a time.</v>

157
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>They called these people meritus,</v>

158
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>which means logs,</v>

159
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 1>which only further to humanize them.</v>

160
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>The average lifespan for these prisoners was only four to six weeks when their</v>

161
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>bodies were done being used.</v>

162
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>They were thrown in a pile and burned in the crematorium,</v>

163
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>in his laboratory Sheria.</v>

164
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:31.500
<v Speaker 1>She was experimenting with the Bubonic Plague,</v>

165
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 1>which is known for being one of the most deadly diseases in history,</v>

166
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't want it to be the same place that we remember from the past.</v>

167
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 1>He genetically altered it to be extremely potent and far more capable of killing</v>

168
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:45.840
<v Speaker 1>people than any previous strain of the plague.</v>

169
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.570
<v Speaker 1>The bubonic plague can only be transferred through blood,</v>

170
00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:50.100
<v Speaker 1>so he wanted to release disease,</v>

171
00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:54.720
<v Speaker 1>written fleas on unsuspecting villages in order to test how strong it truly was.</v>

172
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 1>They collected ramps,</v>

173
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 1>which were perfect incubators for thousands upon thousands of fleas,</v>

174
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.380
<v Speaker 1>and the insects were Catholic,</v>

175
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.030
<v Speaker 1>gathered and put into containers.</v>

176
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.170
<v Speaker 1>First round of experiments had airplanes dropping baskets full of fleas into</v>

177
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Chinese villages,</v>

178
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.941
<v Speaker 1>civilians,</v>

179
00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and it worked exactly as they had hoped.</v>

180
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Between 1939 and 1942 plagues began to spread in these villages.</v>

181
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.680
<v Speaker 1>One third of the total population of each village was wiped out.</v>

182
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.760
<v Speaker 1>These manufactured plagues were so potent that once they were infected people</v>

183
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.060
<v Speaker 1>which is die within one to two days,</v>

184
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>according to testimony by a man named Gene [inaudible],</v>

185
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.840
<v Speaker 1>his sister was infected with this mega plague after being bitten by one of the</v>

186
00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:34.261
<v Speaker 1>fleas.</v>

187
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:36.270
<v Speaker 1>The glands in her neck was so swollen,</v>

188
00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:37.740
<v Speaker 1>it was as large as a hat.</v>

189
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 1>She knew that if she stayed inside and received medical treatment,</v>

190
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:43.720
<v Speaker 1>she would in fact the rest of our family with the plague,</v>

191
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>so she had to go into the middle of a field and die alone.</v>

192
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Their family members could not get near her and they had no choice but to burn</v>

193
00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:53.370
<v Speaker 1>her body in the field where she lay.</v>

194
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>While baskets full of fleas have worked with low flying planes,</v>

195
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 1>shearer,</v>

196
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>she knew that if he wanted to,</v>

197
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>in fact enemy countries,</v>

198
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>they would need to drop actual bombs filled with fleas.</v>

199
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>The only issue was that the fleas would,</v>

200
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.791
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

201
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>

202
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.953
<v Speaker 1>the explosion.</v>

203
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>He figured out that by creating clay pot containers,</v>

204
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 1>he could drop a so called germ bomb that would smash when it's at the grounds</v>

205
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>and the fleas would stay alive,</v>

206
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't just stop at the bubonic plague.</v>

207
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 1>They experiments with anthrax and typhoid as well.</v>

208
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>After dropping these bombs on even more Chinese villages,</v>

209
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese soldiers showed up in all the white lab suits covering their entire</v>

210
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

211
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>They would command villages to come out of their homes and they would find</v>

212
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>subjects who had been infected by the plague and performed dissections in the</v>

213
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.030
<v Speaker 1>middle of a field while their friends and family watched on to share issue.</v>

214
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It was all about gathering data and statistics.</v>

215
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

216
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>they were just numbers on a page.</v>

217
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:48.590
<v Speaker 1>They were not actual human life stem.</v>

218
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>The campaign were even given candy from unit 7:31 and instructed to show up to</v>

219
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>villages and hand out the Swedes to small children.</v>

220
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>While Chinese villages interpreted this as an act of kindness,</v>

221
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>the Kenzie was actually laced with anthrax.</v>

222
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>The scientists would later arrive and observe parents beginning to panic as</v>

223
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 1>their children died in their arms.</v>

224
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.883
<v Speaker 1>As time went on,</v>

225
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>the unit expanded their human experiments beyond diseases.</v>

226
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>They also did experiments on frostbite and the effects of shrapnel wounds.</v>

227
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>This involved strapping people down to a wooden plank before blowing up a bomb</v>

228
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:23.634
<v Speaker 1>next to them.</v>

229
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>All of this was just so they could study how a human would be blown apart by</v>

230
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 1>different types of weapons,</v>

231
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>so I think now is probably a good time for a little breather.</v>

232
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>This one's a bit intense.</v>

233
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean science.</v>

234
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It's responsible for the devastation of lives as we're seeing in this video,</v>

235
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>but is also responsible for the saving of millions used the right way.</v>

236
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Science changes the welds in remarkable ways for the better,</v>

237
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I'm pleased in this video to tell you about brilliance and I know</v>

238
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:50.791
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>

239
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 1>these ads in the middle of their less than awesome but brilliance are fantastic</v>

240
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:57.900
<v Speaker 1>for sponsoring this sort of longer content because it allows us to share the</v>

241
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.080
<v Speaker 1>darker lessons from scientific history in a thoughtful way.</v>

242
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Brilliance on science learning platform that allow youtube learned through</v>

243
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 1>active learning,</v>

244
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:09.810
<v Speaker 1>which summed up is basically the opposite of that feeling of reading a complex</v>

245
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>paragraph about some principle and then just having absolutely no clue what on</v>

246
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:16.310
<v Speaker 1>earth was going on about even on the 10,</v>

247
00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

248
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.950
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

249
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>and they don't just cover the basics,</v>

250
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>although they do cover those as well,</v>

251
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 1>but it goes through to really complex things like advanced statistics.</v>

252
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I was recently going through a course on statistics,</v>

253
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>particularly the one lying with statistics.</v>

254
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing primer on how to be aware of when the media is misusing</v>

255
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.070
<v Speaker 1>statistics to push your opinion one way or the other.</v>

256
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant makes even complex statistical concepts,</v>

257
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.820
<v Speaker 1>easy to understand.</v>

258
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.740
<v Speaker 1>They give you something super short to read.</v>

259
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy and then you immediately apply it to a problem and then you just</v>

260
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>rinse and repeat that and all of a sudden you're understanding things that you</v>

261
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>never thought you would be.</v>

262
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I've been using brilliant for a while.</v>

263
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 1>You should just give it a go to see how easy it is to start understanding</v>

264
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 1>complex subjects so they support biographics going to brilliant.org,</v>

265
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.200
<v Speaker 1>forward slash graphics,</v>

266
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and now let's get back to abusing science.</v>

267
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Even though Shiraishi and unit seven,</v>

268
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.720
<v Speaker 1>31 had developed these deadly weapons,</v>

269
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:16.920
<v Speaker 1>they never made this public knowledge or threatened to use the German bombs.</v>

270
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Some historians believe that if the Americans knew about these bioweapons ahead</v>

271
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:21.541
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

272
00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:25.740
<v Speaker 1>they would have never dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki for</v>

273
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>fear of mutual destruction.</v>

274
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.650
<v Speaker 1>But if you think the allied powers were safe from the sadistic experiments going</v>

275
00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>on in Manchuria well,</v>

276
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.140
<v Speaker 1>think again.</v>

277
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.441
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

278
00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:38.430
<v Speaker 1>If she plans a long distance attack on the United States schools mission cherry</v>

279
00:12:38.431 --> 00:12:39.390
<v Speaker 1>blossoms at night.</v>

280
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.320
<v Speaker 1>They attempted to launch balloons that were filled with deadly diseases like</v>

281
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:43.801
<v Speaker 1>cholera.</v>

282
00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Smallpox in the bubonic plague is whether it's anthrax and botulism and</v>

283
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:49.530
<v Speaker 1>estimated 9,000 balloons,</v>

284
00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:51.090
<v Speaker 1>web center across the Pacific Ocean,</v>

285
00:12:51.091 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but only 345 of them actually made it to the United States.</v>

286
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Many of them were shot down in some landed in the ocean or in forest.</v>

287
00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:02.160
<v Speaker 1>So fields considering there were a lot of Ufo sightings at the time.</v>

288
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 1>It might be possible that some people were seeing these gen buildings and</v>

289
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.020
<v Speaker 1>mistaking them for something else.</v>

290
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It was actually only one of these,</v>

291
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.121
<v Speaker 1>the course,</v>

292
00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:09.954
<v Speaker 1>any casualties.</v>

293
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.790
<v Speaker 1>It landed in a town called bly,</v>

294
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Oregon on May the fifth,</v>

295
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.741
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

296
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:14.574
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>

297
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.570
<v Speaker 1>a Sunday school teacher named Elsie Metro was on a day trip going on a picnic</v>

298
00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and the mountains with a small group of our teenage students,</v>

299
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.410
<v Speaker 1>husbands,</v>

300
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:22.800
<v Speaker 1>archie,</v>

301
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.890
<v Speaker 1>who was also that minister was driving the car up the mountain.</v>

302
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Elsie was a few months pregnant and she got sick during the car ride.</v>

303
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Husband pulled over to better around to get some APP.</v>

304
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.120
<v Speaker 1>They had parked near a crew of men who were doing construction work on the road.</v>

305
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.070
<v Speaker 1>The students in llc decided to take a short walk through the woods and archie</v>

306
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 1>began to speak with the men.</v>

307
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.110
<v Speaker 1>He then heard his wife's voice say,</v>

308
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.280
<v Speaker 1>look what I found.</v>

309
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Followed by an explosion lc.</v>

311
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>You had come across one of the balloons.</v>

312
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.350
<v Speaker 1>She had no idea that it was actually a bomb and approaching it.</v>

313
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.630
<v Speaker 1>She triggered the explosion archie in the crew.</v>

314
00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:58.680
<v Speaker 1>He ran towards the sounds and they found the bodies of LLC into group of</v>

315
00:13:58.681 --> 00:14:00.540
<v Speaker 1>students lying dead on the ground.</v>

316
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:01.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

317
00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.420
<v Speaker 1>most Americans were kept safe from Sherry issues,</v>

318
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:04.081
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

319
00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Those who were stationed in Asia during World War Two,</v>

320
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

321
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.010
<v Speaker 1>they weren't so lucky in 1944 and 1945 American prisoners of war.</v>

322
00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>We're in a city called mud can.</v>

323
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.490
<v Speaker 1>They were visited by Japanese doctors.</v>

324
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Many of them had already been in captivity for several years at this point.</v>

325
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.040
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese wanted to see if the results were any difference on different races</v>

326
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>and objected the men with various deadly diseases and repeated the exact</v>

327
00:14:27.181 --> 00:14:29.730
<v Speaker 1>experiments that were done on the Chinese.</v>

328
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Many of these men died and the ones who survived were only kept around so they</v>

329
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:35.880
<v Speaker 1>could carry away the bodies of their friends</v>

330
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.520
<v Speaker 1>when World War Two was over,</v>

331
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.390
<v Speaker 1>the allied forces,</v>

332
00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:48.410
<v Speaker 1>one is that they took away power from Emperor Hirohito in Manchuria.</v>

333
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.450
<v Speaker 1>China had defeated the Japanese as well.</v>

334
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 1>There was nowhere left for issued to hide Nazi war criminals.</v>

335
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>They were being brought to trial in Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946,</v>

336
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 1>and many of them were being sentenced to death for the crimes against humanity.</v>

337
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.350
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese military still awarded Shero issue with medals of honor into</v>

338
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 1>healthy pension for his retirement.</v>

339
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 1>In their eyes,</v>

340
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>he was a hero for the country,</v>

341
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 1>but he knew that America would not feel the same,</v>

342
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.910
<v Speaker 1>especially once they had the stories from the POW use Shiro Ishii commanded his</v>

343
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 1>doctors and soldiers to never speak of the experiments that went on in unit</v>

344
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>7:31,</v>

345
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 1>but of course they learned about the experiments through the American soldiers</v>

346
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>who survived the American government's approached issue,</v>

347
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but instead of arresting him,</v>

348
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.470
<v Speaker 1>they asked to make a deal.</v>

349
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They wanted his data in exchange for immunity.</v>

350
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Sure is.</v>

351
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>She knew that this was the only way he could save himself.</v>

352
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 1>He promised that if they pardoned all of his crimes,</v>

353
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:47.390
<v Speaker 1>the US government could benefit from having all of the scientific information</v>

354
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that they had gathered from their experiments.</v>

355
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 1>In the United States.</v>

356
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:55.160
<v Speaker 1>There are ethical laws in place so that American scientists are never allowed to</v>

357
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.440
<v Speaker 1>experiment on human beings by law.</v>

358
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:59.390
<v Speaker 1>They can only experiments on animals.</v>

359
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.201
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>

360
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the government knew that these experiments were truly valuable because it was</v>

361
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>information that they would never be able to receive on their own.</v>

362
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to inject a rat or a rabbit with a disease,</v>

363
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's a totally different thing to actually know the results on human beings</v>

364
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>

365
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the Americans would gain access to the vaccines that it wishy develops some of</v>

366
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the deadliest diseases known to mankind.</v>

367
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.590
<v Speaker 1>They agreed to trade his data in exchange for his life and they even paid him</v>

368
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>$250,000 and in modern money,</v>

369
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that's about two point 6 million.</v>

370
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 1>All of the scientists and soldiers who were involved with unit seven,</v>

371
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.551
<v Speaker 1>31,</v>

372
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:41.150
<v Speaker 1>we're happy to keep the secrets because they were deeply ashamed of their</v>

373
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>participation with a project.</v>

374
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Some of them even felt too ashamed to return to Japan because they were afraid</v>

375
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 1>that people would learn about that.</v>

376
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Crime's a few of them even trying to live in China,</v>

377
00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:52.340
<v Speaker 1>runs new identities.</v>

378
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times tried to expose this by publishing an article about is human</v>

379
00:16:56.151 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 1>experiments in 1946,</v>

380
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 1>but the owns that the events gains for a little media attention since all of</v>

381
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 1>these atrocities happened in Nigeria,</v>

382
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>they were technically a part of the second signer,</v>

383
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:07.581
<v Speaker 1>Japanese war,</v>

384
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and not World War Two.</v>

385
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Even though both wars were happening simultaneously for Americans,</v>

386
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it was overshadowed by the thousands of testimonies coming out of Europe about</v>

387
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:17.084
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust,</v>

388
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 1>but of course the Chinese people,</v>

389
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 1>they have not forgotten.</v>

390
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Even to this day in many Chinese people still hate the Japanese for what happens</v>

391
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.573
<v Speaker 1>during this war.</v>

392
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.241
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

393
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 1>most Japanese civilians were unaware of issues,</v>

394
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>human experiments,</v>

395
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>and they consider themselves to be mostly victims of the war.</v>

396
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 1>After the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,</v>

397
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese surrendered since there was never the chance for them to start a</v>

398
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.900
<v Speaker 1>massive global plague.</v>

399
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.110
<v Speaker 1>So what about those pow?</v>

400
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 1>In the 19 forties,</v>

401
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:45.891
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

402
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 1>officials approached them and demanded that they sign a nondisclosure contract.</v>

403
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 1>They promised never to expose the truth about what had happened to them in</v>

404
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.144
<v Speaker 1>Manchuria.</v>

405
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.541
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

406
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 eighties,</v>

407
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 1>many of those soldiers felt that they had nothing left to lose and they came</v>

408
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>forward to testify that they had been a part of these human experiments.</v>

409
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.050
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until the 19 nineties that Japan officially acknowledged that unit</v>

410
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 1>7:31 was real and it wasn't just a conspiracy theory.</v>

411
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Shiro Ishii Windsor live into old age and he died at the age of 67 even after</v>

412
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:17.214
<v Speaker 1>the wars were over.</v>

413
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 1>That plagues that share wishy unleashed in China continue to spread and kill</v>

414
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>people for years to come is exact number of victims is unknown.</v>

415
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Some estimate that he was responsible for tens of thousands,</v>

416
