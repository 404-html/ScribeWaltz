<v Speaker 1>He created a body that was to become the gold standard for muscular development.</v>

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.830
<v Speaker 1>He would use it to achieve one goal after another,</v>

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>rising to the very pinnacle of not one,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but three careers from the very start.</v>

5
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger had the odds stacked against him.</v>

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>He was dismissed.</v>

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>He was ridiculed.</v>

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.900
<v Speaker 1>He was parodied.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Leslie,</v>

11
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>what people fail to realize was that Arnold strongest muscle,</v>

12
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't as biceps.</v>

13
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>It was his brain with its.</v>

14
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>He orchestrated career moves that took him to the very,</v>

15
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>very top.</v>

16
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>In this biographics video,</v>

17
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>we're going to uncover the unlikely rags to riches story of the one and only</v>

18
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwartzenegger.</v>

19
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>notes Watson scenango was born in the tiny and Austrian village of near Grand</v>

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.541
<v Speaker 1>Central and the 30th,</v>

22
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>1947.</v>

23
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Gustavo,</v>

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>was the local police chief arnold and his older brother Meinhart grub under the</v>

26
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>tough discipline of a man who was used to being a bait on those early years.</v>

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Speaker 1>They were incredibly regimented.</v>

28
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>It'd be up at six and then off to get the milk from the farm next door.</v>

29
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Then you would have to do a set of physical exercises that his father had</v>

30
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>written out for him.</v>

31
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He would earn his breakfast if I'm doing a certain number of setups.</v>

32
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>In the afternoon after I'd finished his homework and chores,</v>

33
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>his father made arnold in mine heart practice soccer.</v>

34
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>No matter how bad the weather was,</v>

35
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>if they messed up on a play,</v>

36
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>they got yelled at because staff had been a champion Ice Keller in his younger</v>

37
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>years and he pushed his sons.</v>

38
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you excel physically with his father's pushing?</v>

39
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:46.251
<v Speaker 1>I'll load first.</v>

40
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Got into competitive sports at the age of 10.</v>

41
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>He played soccer passionately for almost five years.</v>

42
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>When he was 15,</v>

43
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I was a soccer coach.</v>

44
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Decided that lifting weights for an hour once a week would be a good way for his</v>

45
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>players to stay in shape.</v>

46
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

47
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>He took them for a visit to the local gym.</v>

48
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>This is a day if it would absolutely change Arnold's life.</v>

49
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He was mesmerized by the sheer size of the bodybuilders you've talked to the</v>

50
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>

51
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>waging war with steel weights on older with leisure.</v>

52
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Record his feelings and his 19,</v>

53
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 1>77 or so biography arnold,</v>

54
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>the education of a bodybuilder there.</v>

55
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It was before me,</v>

56
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>

57
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the answer had been seeking.</v>

58
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It clicked.</v>

59
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It was something I suddenly just seemed to reach out and find as if I'd been</v>

60
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:31.661
<v Speaker 1>crossing a suspended bridge and finally stepped off onto solid grounds on old.</v>

61
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>He embraced weightlifting.</v>

62
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 1>He seemed discovered that he had an amazing ability to build muscle and within</v>

63
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>two years he had already overtaken most of the other trainers at the gym and</v>

64
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>grabbed swear.</v>

65
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>He worked out religiously.</v>

66
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 1>He also trained harder than anyone else.</v>

67
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>One Sunday discovering that the gym was closed,</v>

68
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>he actually smashed the window in order to get in so that he could complete his</v>

69
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>work out his father,</v>

70
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>that he was less than impressed with his son's new found obsession.</v>

71
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilding,</v>

72
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>it was really a fringe sport in Australia at that time with those who are</v>

73
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>politic of what's being looked down upon and considered in some way defective.</v>

74
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>When it was discovered that Donald had pictures of half naked men with bulging</v>

75
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>muscles on his bedroom wall,</v>

76
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>a psychiatrist was called in to save on old from himself.</v>

77
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>The psychologist assured his parents that this was simply a phase and arnold</v>

78
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>would absolutely grow out of this and well,</v>

79
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.091
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

80
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>he absolutely didn't.</v>

81
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 17,</v>

82
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Arnold had already realized that bodybuilding was going to be his vehicle to</v>

83
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>weld wide fame.</v>

84
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>He spends many Saturday afternoons down at the local movie theater,</v>

85
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>watching bodybuilders turned,</v>

86
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>actors such as Steve Reeves,</v>

87
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>centers,</v>

88
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>personal favorite ranch park.</v>

89
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>He watched them onscreen Blang,</v>

90
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Hercules,</v>

91
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>and other mythic heroes.</v>

92
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>They had used bodybuilding in order to create careers as movie stars,</v>

93
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>and that was exactly what Arnold wanted to do.</v>

94
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Only he was going to be bigger and better than any of them.</v>

95
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Arnold,</v>

96
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.180
<v Speaker 1>he entered the Austrian army in 1965 in order to fulfill his one year of</v>

97
00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:08.900
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

98
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.321
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

99
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:12.680
<v Speaker 1>it builds his body to 200 pounds of Herculean muscle.</v>

100
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.020
<v Speaker 1>He was assigned as a drive it in a tank units.</v>

101
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after he was inducted,</v>

102
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Arnold received an invitation to compete in the junior division of the midst of</v>

103
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Europe contest in Stuttgart,</v>

104
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

105
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>but he was in the middle of basic training.</v>

106
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>No soldier was allowed to leave the base for any reason,</v>

107
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.840
<v Speaker 1>but almost knew that his destiny was tied with winning this contest,</v>

108
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 1>so he decided to go,</v>

109
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:34.221
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

110
00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>well they in order to get beat,</v>

111
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>he crawled over the wall,</v>

112
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.670
<v Speaker 1>taking only the clothes he was wearing and barely enough money to buy a third</v>

113
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:41.810
<v Speaker 1>class ticket to Germany.</v>

114
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Speaker 1>When he arrived at the competition,</v>

115
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:46.460
<v Speaker 1>he actually had to borrow someone else's posing trunks and they're tanning oil</v>

116
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

117
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 1>His muscles were undeniable.</v>

118
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Last night it was announced junior Mr Europe.</v>

119
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>At first the army,</v>

120
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.510
<v Speaker 1>they were not exactly impressed and he was actually jailed for seven days with</v>

121
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>only a blanket on a cold stone bench and almost no food,</v>

122
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 1>but within a few days the news of his victory,</v>

123
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it spreads as the top brass decided that the title added Prestige to the army.</v>

124
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 1>When he returned to the ranks,</v>

125
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:10.130
<v Speaker 1>he was held up as a sort of ideal with his drill instructor.</v>

126
00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:10.964
<v Speaker 1>Telling the troops,</v>

127
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you have to fight for your father,</v>

128
00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:13.850
<v Speaker 1>that you have to take courage.</v>

129
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at what Schwartz negatives.</v>

130
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Just to win this title,</v>

131
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.200
<v Speaker 1>not following his stint in the army.</v>

132
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Arnold took a job as a gym instructor at a Health Club in Munich,</v>

133
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

134
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.220
<v Speaker 1>This presented him with the ideal opportunity to train for the 19,</v>

135
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.230
<v Speaker 1>66 Mrs Europe competition.</v>

136
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.640
<v Speaker 1>This was the next step and his master plan to become the best built man on the</v>

137
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:32.180
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

138
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.410
<v Speaker 1>He trained twice a day,</v>

139
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 1>working like a champ possessed in order to forge his winning physique.</v>

140
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 1>By the time he arrived in stuck out for the contest,</v>

141
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.270
<v Speaker 1>people were anxious to get a look at this monster from Munich,</v>

142
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.860
<v Speaker 1>the one that that had room is all about all of the attention infused on old with</v>

143
00:05:48.861 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 1>a great deal of confidence under your already felt like the winner.</v>

144
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Arnold's,</v>

145
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 1>when that day was so emphatic that the judge has offered to pay his way to the</v>

146
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>upcoming Mr. Universe.</v>

147
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>He arrived in London,</v>

148
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean almost no English,</v>

149
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as he stepped out of his cap,</v>

150
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>people began mobbing him.</v>

151
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>They'd all been waiting for them,</v>

152
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.160
<v Speaker 1>the first bodybuilder in Europe with 20 inch arms,</v>

153
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately he didn't win that day.</v>

154
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.210
<v Speaker 1>The American shatter.</v>

155
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Your son had a more complete defined physique and he forced Donald's to accept</v>

156
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.210
<v Speaker 1>second place on.</v>

157
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Ols returned to Munich and threw himself back into his training.</v>

158
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>He shut everything out of his mind and concentrated on only one thing.</v>

159
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Winning the 19,</v>

162
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.680

163
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>that's 20 years of age.</v>

164
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.790
<v Speaker 1>The youngest Mr University history a year later and even more massive on</v>

165
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>returning to London to claim the professional Mr. Universe title,</v>

166
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>following that victory,</v>

167
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Donald received the phone call that would prove to be the next great signposts</v>

168
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.890
<v Speaker 1>to his future on the other end of the line and it was Joe Weider Bodybuilding</v>

169
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Guru and publisher of Muscle Builder magazine,</v>

170
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>wider invited Arnold to compete in the IFB be Mr. Universe in Miami and then</v>

171
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>come to train in California and work for him</v>

172
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>on older arrives in America in September 1968 with the gym bag at 20 US dollars.</v>

173
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Still virtually no English,</v>

174
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.960
<v Speaker 1>he settled into a small apartment in Venice beach and was given a small stipend</v>

175
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>money wider in exchange for the rights to use this image in magazines.</v>

176
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Arnold's plan was to stay in the USA for one year,</v>

177
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.300
<v Speaker 1>absorb their trading strategies,</v>

178
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.180
<v Speaker 1>and then use them to beat the Americans at their own game.</v>

179
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Almost began training.</v>

180
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a small gym in Venice Beach,</v>

181
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles called Gold's gym.</v>

182
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.870
<v Speaker 1>He rubbed shoulders with all the American top.</v>

183
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilders quickly established himself as the leader of the pack.</v>

184
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.780
<v Speaker 1>In 1970 arnold,</v>

185
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>he won the coveted triple crown of bodybuilding claiming at the Mr Universe,</v>

186
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Mr. World,</v>

187
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.021
<v Speaker 1>ams,</v>

188
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>the Mr Olympia titles.</v>

189
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.410
<v Speaker 1>He was now the undisputed king of bodybuilding.</v>

190
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Arnold went onto win six consecutive Mr Olympia titles as he completely</v>

191
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 1>dominated the sport and with this well,</v>

192
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>he was ready to implement phase two if it's master</v>

193
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.493
<v Speaker 2>flat</v>

194
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.340
<v Speaker 1>in services,</v>

195
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Jay y dot.</v>

196
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I got a call from a film production company looking for a bodybuilder to play</v>

197
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Hercules in a low budget film.</v>

198
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Why did he immediately thought of Arnold's telling the producer that Arnie had</v>

199
00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 1>been a shakespearian actor,</v>

200
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:28.860
<v Speaker 1>that back in Europe,</v>

201
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.720
<v Speaker 1>they signed him up immediately.</v>

202
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.130
<v Speaker 1>The result was Hercules goes to New York and it was to be Arnold first stands,</v>

203
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:36.270
<v Speaker 1>most forgettable film.</v>

204
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It's credits.</v>

205
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Reid,</v>

206
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Arnold strong and thick Austrian accent was actually dubbed over.</v>

207
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>

208
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.530
<v Speaker 1>They got paid $10,000,</v>

209
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.280
<v Speaker 1>which he invested into California real estate his next paycheck or is it</v>

210
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:50.940
<v Speaker 1>actually takes some time coming because bottled found Hollywood's less receptive</v>

211
00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:51.750
<v Speaker 1>than he had hoped,</v>

212
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.840
<v Speaker 1>several agents and tells him that he had everything going against him.</v>

213
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>He a long name,</v>

214
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.110
<v Speaker 1>which was difficult to pronounce,</v>

215
00:08:57.111 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>to strain Jackson's salvador loft and unusual builds which will never make it</v>

216
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>into films for Ronald's.</v>

217
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>This was the very motivation that he needed back in Australia.</v>

218
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>He had been told that he could never become a champion bodybuilder,</v>

219
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and yet that is exactly what he became.</v>

220
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:12.541
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

221
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>he would reinvents himself through the same as sheer hard work and dedication</v>

222
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that he had learned in the gym in order to become the highest paid movie star on</v>

223
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

224
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 1>He would make those agents in their words on north.</v>

225
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>He began acting lessons in 1974.</v>

226
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>He won a supporting role in the Bob Rafelson movie.</v>

227
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Stay hungry.</v>

228
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.661
<v Speaker 1>In this movie,</v>

229
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:32.630
<v Speaker 1>he played a bodybuilder named Joe Sando,</v>

230
00:09:32.631 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>so it's hardly stretched his acting ability still.</v>

231
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>He was absolutely determined to make an impression and make an impression.</v>

232
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

233
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>He won the Golden Globe for best newcomer.</v>

234
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1977,</v>

235
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the documentary pumping on opened in theaters the chronicle Donald's victory in</v>

236
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:52.431
<v Speaker 1>the 1975 Mr Olympia over the new for the future incredible hulk as his charming,</v>

237
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 1>confident self Arnold's onscreen charisma.</v>

238
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.090
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible to resist pumping on lead just more roles in the movie.</v>

239
00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>It's the villain and the Jayne Mansfield Story.</v>

240
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.201
<v Speaker 1>Bali.</v>

241
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:12.100
<v Speaker 1>This point in his life,</v>

242
00:10:12.101 --> 00:10:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I know he was already a successful businessman.</v>

243
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.830
<v Speaker 1>He was combining real estate investments of best selling biography and</v>

244
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.480
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding training courses.</v>

245
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.330
<v Speaker 1>This meant that he could afford to wait for just the right film projects.</v>

246
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.510
<v Speaker 1>He filled his time with public appearances and social functions.</v>

247
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.870
<v Speaker 1>One such function was the Robert F Kennedy tennis tournament in Hyannisport.</v>

248
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.750
<v Speaker 1>There he caught the eye of a beautiful,</v>

249
00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 1>dark haired girl by the name of Maria Shriver,</v>

250
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:38.200
<v Speaker 1>that she was the daughter of gardens and Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the niece of</v>

251
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:39.220
<v Speaker 1>John Fitzgerald,</v>

252
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy Animals and Maria.</v>

253
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

254
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.520
<v Speaker 1>they fell in love at first sight,</v>

255
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.420
<v Speaker 1>the Shriver's.</v>

256
00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:46.710
<v Speaker 1>They were great philanthropists and through them monitored was introduced to</v>

257
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:47.830
<v Speaker 1>these Special Olympics,</v>

258
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.410
<v Speaker 1>which she has been passionately involved with ever since.</v>

259
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>In 1979,</v>

260
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I began a career as a CBS sports commentator.</v>

261
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.150
<v Speaker 1>He also graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a business degree,</v>

262
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.200
<v Speaker 1>but it was a year later.</v>

263
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.790
<v Speaker 1>He's stunned the bodybuilding world with his comeback at the Mr Olympia</v>

264
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.690
<v Speaker 1>competition in Australia.</v>

265
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.030
<v Speaker 1>There he captured his seventh title,</v>

266
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.260
<v Speaker 1>cementing his legendary status as the greatest bodybuilder of all time.</v>

267
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Arnold's come back though it wasn't without controversy.</v>

268
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.070
<v Speaker 1>He went to Australia in the role of a TV reporter only signing his name to the</v>

269
00:11:18.071 --> 00:11:19.630
<v Speaker 1>register at the last minute.</v>

270
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.500
<v Speaker 1>He was also good friends with the head judge bodybuilding legend build Po.</v>

271
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 1>The general consensus was the Donald on stage.</v>

272
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It was a mere shadow of his former self is victory,</v>

273
00:11:28.301 --> 00:11:31.750
<v Speaker 1>was for the first time actually greeted by Booz still.</v>

274
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.850
<v Speaker 1>He had his seventh Mr Olympia title,</v>

275
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the great shape that Arnold said goes into for the 1980 Mr Libya propelled him</v>

276
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.470
<v Speaker 1>to his breakthrough role as Conan the barbarian.</v>

277
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>After spending a year in working on his speech and learning how to use our</v>

278
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.553

<v Speaker 1>he headed off to Yugoslavia in Spain for a grueling six month shoot Conan the</v>

280
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:02.441
<v Speaker 1>barbarian.</v>

281
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It rakes in more than a hundred million dollars at the box office together with</v>

282
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>its sequel Conan the destroyer,</v>

283
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>it firmly embedded the name Arnold Schwartzenegger into movie go is</v>

284
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.021
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

285
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:14.470
<v Speaker 1>As following his success with the Conan movies,</v>

286
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Arnold was offered a low budget movie by first time director and screenwriter,</v>

287
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.690
<v Speaker 1>James Cameron.</v>

288
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.990
<v Speaker 1>This would prove to be his most iconic role in the terminator on old place,</v>

289
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 1>a sidebar except back in time to kill the mother of the man who will save</v>

290
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>humankind from destruction.</v>

291
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.371
<v Speaker 1>The role well,</v>

292
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>it was made for Ronald's,</v>

293
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 1>his accent and his body.</v>

294
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>The very things that agents had said would work against him were perfect for the</v>

295
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:38.610
<v Speaker 1>part of the thousands.</v>

296
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.230
<v Speaker 1>The terminator was an absolute smash,</v>

297
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 1>firmly establishing Arnold as the next great action stop.</v>

298
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>By 1985.</v>

299
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>He had already been named international star of the year and on April the 26th,</v>

300
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:49.391
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

301
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:50.000
<v Speaker 1>86,</v>

302
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.740
<v Speaker 1>arnold's a staunch Republican as Maria Shriver,</v>

303
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>a member of democratic royalty,</v>

304
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.610
<v Speaker 1>or they were married but their honeymoon.</v>

305
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It was barely over before arnold flew to Mexico to film his latest action</v>

306
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>blockbuster credit at this movie again,</v>

307
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:06.830
<v Speaker 1>one in the title action star of the year after a string of action films come</v>

308
00:13:06.831 --> 00:13:07.570
<v Speaker 1>onto a raw deal,</v>

309
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>predecessor and the running man.</v>

310
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>The forward thinking arnold was ready for a new challenge and that challenge is</v>

311
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.320
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

312
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.153
<v Speaker 1>So unsurprisingly,</v>

313
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>very few are willing to take a gamble on Arnold as a comic actor,</v>

314
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 1>but one who was was the director Ivan Reitman.</v>

315
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.580
<v Speaker 1>You created a special vehicle for adults this vehicle,</v>

316
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 1>but it was called twins.</v>

317
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 1>The irresistible chemistry of Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito made twins and</v>

318
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 1>immediate hit,</v>

319
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>and two years later,</v>

320
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 1>honnold again teamed up with and for kindergarten cop,</v>

321
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.370
<v Speaker 1>another comedy success.</v>

322
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>A large part of the success of these films is Arnold's ability to laugh at</v>

323
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:40.900
<v Speaker 1>himself on always,</v>

324
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:41.711
<v Speaker 1>always got the job,</v>

325
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 1>which was really endearing to fans over and above that I know it's also a gifted</v>

326
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:45.821
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

327
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:48.100
<v Speaker 1>As anyone who's seen pumping iron will know now,</v>

328
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:51.050
<v Speaker 1>one person who noticed on those abilities on kindergarten cop,</v>

329
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>especially his rapport with children with President George Bush,</v>

330
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Bush appointed as the chairman of the President's Council on physical fitness.</v>

331
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Now this could have really been a symbolic role,</v>

332
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but arnold,</v>

333
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>he totally threw himself into it with absolute relish visiting every state in</v>

334
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:07.870
<v Speaker 1>order to promote the fitness lifestyle.</v>

335
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.321
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

336
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>this movie winning streak,</v>

337
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 1>it totally continued for Arnold yet total recall and terminator two,</v>

338
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>this sequel cost $100,</v>

339
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.221
<v Speaker 1>million dollars,</v>

340
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 1>making it the most expensive film at the time it returns an astonishing 519</v>

341
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:22.110
<v Speaker 1>point $8,000,000 with Arnie.</v>

342
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Pocketing a cruel 15 million.</v>

343
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:24.971
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

344
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Arnold's next big movie out seeing was the last action hero,</v>

345
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>a $100,000,000 extravaganza,</v>

346
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>which seemed like a short thing,</v>

347
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.800
<v Speaker 1>but felt it was a box office bomb and critical flop.</v>

348
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's was really quick to tear it down,</v>

349
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 1>claiming that his time in the limelight was over,</v>

350
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>but Schwartzenegger,</v>

351
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 1>he had other ideas.</v>

352
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.850
<v Speaker 1>He bounced back from defeat with the same focus determination as in as</v>

353
00:14:46.851 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding days.</v>

354
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>He retained with James Cameron for the action packs.</v>

355
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.430
<v Speaker 1>James Bond Spoof true lies well.</v>

356
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:53.820
<v Speaker 1>The movie was a smash on nodes.</v>

357
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Critics were once again silenced and he was back on top.</v>

358
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.940
<v Speaker 1>In the mid 19 nineties,</v>

359
00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:12.570
<v Speaker 1>all began focusing on giving Max to the country that had given him so much.</v>

360
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.590
<v Speaker 1>He became an organizer and sponsor of the annual inner city games.</v>

361
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.470
<v Speaker 1>He was also very involved in the afterschool care program.</v>

362
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.860
<v Speaker 1>In 2003 during an appearance on the Jay Leno show,</v>

363
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Arnold announced his candidacy for governor of California.</v>

364
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.300
<v Speaker 1>This was following the recall of Governor Gray Davis sparks by the California</v>

365
00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:31.410
<v Speaker 1>electricity crisis.</v>

366
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I'd he ran an energetic campaign discipline.</v>

367
00:15:33.721 --> 00:15:38.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a smear campaign organized by the La Times and number of women claims over</v>

368
00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the years on altered,</v>

369
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>molested them while of claims to have had a fence with him still on old.</v>

370
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.680
<v Speaker 1>He was able to rise above this with his unique mix of chogm intelligence,</v>

371
00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:50.880
<v Speaker 1>and on one occasion someone threw an egg which splashes Omanis jackets.</v>

372
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He immediately went to the Jack is all,</v>

373
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:54.570
<v Speaker 1>threw it over his shoulder and called out.</v>

374
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

375
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I a bacon with those eggs on he,</v>

376
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.770
<v Speaker 1>he easily won the governorship.</v>

377
00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Hands immediately sat about cleaning house at Sacramento,</v>

378
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.000
<v Speaker 1>bringing his own unique styles.</v>

379
00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:05.640
<v Speaker 1>That position such as calling as democratic opposition,</v>

380
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.230
<v Speaker 1>gunny men almost first time it was marked by such early victories as repealing a</v>

381
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:14.310
<v Speaker 1>vehicle license in Greece and stopping illegals from getting driver's licenses,</v>

382
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.510
<v Speaker 1>but then powerful state to unions began to oppose his initiatives and for ballot</v>

383
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:18.781
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>

384
00:16:18.781 --> 00:16:21.660
<v Speaker 1>He sponsored in a special election in 2005.</v>

385
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.553
<v Speaker 1>They were the fetus.</v>

386
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.443
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>

387
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>he was reelected governor in 2006 with 56 percent of the votes on a second time.</v>

388
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.750
<v Speaker 1>He put a lot of effort into environmental issues.</v>

389
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.860
<v Speaker 1>In 2006,</v>

390
00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:34.200
<v Speaker 1>he signs the global warming Solutions Act,</v>

391
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:39.240
<v Speaker 1>making California the first state to put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions on</v>

392
00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:40.500
<v Speaker 1>old second time as governor.</v>

393
00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It came to an end in January of 2011.</v>

394
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.130
<v Speaker 1>A few months later,</v>

395
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.120
<v Speaker 1>the La Times ran a cover story repurposing that Arnold had fathered a child 14</v>

396
00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:52.530
<v Speaker 1>years previously that the family's longterm mate as a direct result of this</v>

397
00:16:52.531 --> 00:16:56.160
<v Speaker 1>revelation and Maria and just that 25 year marriage,</v>

398
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.640
<v Speaker 1>she and therefore children moved out to the family home in Brentwood.</v>

399
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

400
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Arnold's post governorship movie career has seen him feature in such action as</v>

401
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.620
<v Speaker 1>the expendables two and three escape plan,</v>

402
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.460
<v Speaker 1>sabotage,</v>

403
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 1>and the fifth installment Terminator in which he battles his younger self on lts</v>

404
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 1>maintained strong ties to the bodybuilding world following his retirement from</v>

405
00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:25.921
<v Speaker 1>the sport.</v>

406
00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:26.820
<v Speaker 1>In 1975,</v>

407
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.980
<v Speaker 1>he promoted the Mr Olympia competition.</v>

408
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1989,</v>

409
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.040
<v Speaker 1>he ends longtime partner Jim lorimer started the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic,</v>

410
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.960
<v Speaker 1>which is now the second biggest pro bodybuilding show just behind Mr Olympia</v>

411
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Arnold credits all of his success.</v>

412
00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Do these self discipline drive and focus that he learns from his body building</v>

413
00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:46.860
<v Speaker 1>career in more recent times,</v>

414
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Donald has been involved in a social media feud with President Donald trump in</v>

415
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>the wake of ani,</v>

416
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>replacing trump won celebrity apprentice.</v>

417
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Trump blames on all for the show.</v>

418
00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>That's dismal ratings,</v>

419
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:59.220
