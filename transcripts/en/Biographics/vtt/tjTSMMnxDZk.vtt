00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.350
<v Speaker 1>In 1937,</v>

2
00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Amelia earhart was one of the most famous women on the planet for the last</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>She had been up ending stereotypes,</v>

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>smashing records,</v>

6
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and establishing herself as an international role model as she settled for her</v>

7
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>greatest adventure around the world,</v>

8
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>excursion the whole world was watching.</v>

9
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly she was gone,</v>

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>just disappeared.</v>

11
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>And this week's biographics,</v>

12
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>we delve into the marvelous and the mysterious life and the death of Amelia</v>

13
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.053
<v Speaker 1>earhart.</v>

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Amelia earhart was born on July the 24th,</v>

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.061
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

16
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>97 in Atchison,</v>

17
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Kansas.</v>

18
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>She was the older of two daughters.</v>

19
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:46.231
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

20
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Edwin and amy with system Muriel being two years younger.</v>

21
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Edward stands on.</v>

22
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It was a talented lawyer who worked for the railways.</v>

23
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Is Korea,</v>

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>was blighted by an addiction to alcohol.</v>

25
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Emilia was named after her maternal grandmother,</v>

26
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Millie Otis,</v>

27
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.101
<v Speaker 1>Millie,</v>

28
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:02.561
<v Speaker 1>and Emilia.</v>

29
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.394
<v Speaker 1>His grandfather,</v>

30
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Alfred,</v>

31
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>actually took the girl in and she lived with them during the school year in</v>

32
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Atchison from the ages of three to 11.</v>

33
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>During the holidays,</v>

34
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>she went to live with our parents in Kansas City.</v>

35
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>they were attended a private college preparatory school until she was ready for</v>

37
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

38
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Becoming an avid reader.</v>

39
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Young Emilia spent many long hours devouring books of every source,</v>

40
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>even though she spent most of the year away from him.</v>

41
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Emilia adored how witty and well educated Father Edwin Woods entertained the</v>

42
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>girls and their friends with western thrillers complete with bandits,</v>

43
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:33.841
<v Speaker 1>Indians,</v>

44
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>cowboys,</v>

45
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>and other made up characters.</v>

46
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Emilia marveled over his command of the English language and one letter he</v>

47
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>addressed her as dear parallel pepitone,</v>

48
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>and she rushed to find a dictionary to discover the words,</v>

49
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

50
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>despite his brilliance as a wordsmith,</v>

51
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Edwin was not so lucky when it came to financial matters as a railroad liar.</v>

52
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>He never really applied himself,</v>

53
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>preferring rather to spend his time coming up with inventions that would make</v>

54
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>his fortune.</v>

55
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>In 1993,</v>

56
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>he designed the device,</v>

57
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>do hold signal flags on the ends of trains full of enthusiasm.</v>

58
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>He traveled to Washington DC to fill his plans with the patterns office.</v>

59
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>After too frustrating days,</v>

60
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>he read back to Amelia's mother verse.</v>

61
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>A man from Colorado had filed patents on an identical hold a two years ago.</v>

62
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>This news is a terrible blow because I had been counseling on receiving several</v>

63
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>hundred dollars from the railroad for my flag holder.</v>

64
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>We're still the money that Edwin had been counting on was earmarked to pay the</v>

65
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>family's property taxes in order to pay the tax bill,</v>

66
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>and he had to sell a collection of valuable law books that had been given to him</v>

67
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>by his father in law judge.</v>

68
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>The judge was furious that his son in law had done these things and a year later</v>

69
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>when Edwin took his wife and two girls for a week long trip to the world's fair</v>

70
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>in San Louis,</v>

71
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>the judge considered the trip and extravagant waste of money and further proof</v>

72
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>of headwinds,</v>

73
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>spendthrift habits.</v>

74
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Despite our grandfathers reservations,</v>

75
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Emilia loved the trip.</v>

76
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Has she enthusiastically rushed with sister around the 1500 buildings and 12</v>

77
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>palaces old lit by these still relatively new phenomenon of electricity.</v>

78
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Her autobiography,</v>

79
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the fun of it's published in 1932,</v>

80
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean pinpointed three important threads that attracted her to aviation and</v>

81
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>interested in mechanics.</v>

82
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>The many railroad trip street took with her father and her love of</v>

83
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>experimentation with sports and Games as a railroad claims agents,</v>

84
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Edwin was able to take his family on trips all over the country that travels,</v>

85
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>developed and Emilia a deep seated desire to see more and more of the world at</v>

86
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>

87
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>When Emilia wasn't traveling,</v>

88
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.030
<v Speaker 1>she spent hours sitting with our cousins,</v>

89
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>knew c and Catherine Shalles looking over maps of faraway places and dreaming of</v>

90
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>overseas excursions from the beginning.</v>

91
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>The future Aviatrix was a daredevil who acted as if she was immune to danger.</v>

92
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>She was attracted to every type of sport,</v>

93
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but she chafed under the societal stereotypes of the day,</v>

94
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>which limited gals to reading,</v>

95
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.811
<v Speaker 1>sewing,</v>

96
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>and cooking.</v>

97
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>She was lucky that she had parents who encouraged her tastes for boys pursuits</v>

98
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>and allowed her and her sister to dress in dark blue flannel bloomers gathered</v>

99
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>up at the knees for play rather than the customer addresses and Pinafores at</v>

100
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

101
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Emilia was known as Millie.</v>

102
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>She earns good grades but seem to be rather impatient and she didn't worry about</v>

103
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the details of academic work.</v>

104
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>She would quite easily solve math problems in our head,</v>

105
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>but couldn't be bothered writing out her working.</v>

106
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>This lack of attention to detail was a trait that stayed with the media into</v>

107
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 1>adulthood.</v>

108
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It was at the Iowa state fair in 19.</v>

109
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:19.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

110
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:19.541
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

111
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>The two media saw her first aeroplane.</v>

112
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>She recalled it as a thing of rust and why that didn't interest her soul and she</v>

113
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>wasn't alone at the time.</v>

114
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Neither automobiles nor planes were predicted to become a functional means of</v>

115
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:32.374
<v Speaker 1>transportation.</v>

116
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.981
<v Speaker 1>In Nineteen Oh,</v>

117
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

118
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Emilia stops living with our grandparents,</v>

119
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Naprosyn and moved with our parents do des Moines,</v>

120
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Iowa,</v>

121
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>that she entered public school.</v>

122
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>She did well academically.</v>

123
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Despite our problems at home.</v>

124
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Our parents argued constantly,</v>

125
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>mainly over money and the constant and drove her beloved father to the bottle.</v>

126
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>This was at a time when states across America were increasingly becoming dry.</v>

127
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Public displays of drunkenness were a source of great humiliation as a result of</v>

128
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>the public inebriation of Edwin stands in heart.</v>

129
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Soon became the talk of the town,</v>

130
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the heavy drinking eventually led to Edwin losing his job at the railway for</v>

131
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>over a year.</v>

132
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>He remains out of work.</v>

133
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Finally securing a menial clacking job.</v>

134
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It required that the family moved to simple Minnesota.</v>

135
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.870
<v Speaker 1>The departure from Iowa was a depressing one for the girls,</v>

136
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 1>but especially for that long suffering mother,</v>

137
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>as they boarded the railroad car doesn't pull.</v>

138
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 1>She shed tears of frustration.</v>

139
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Life was tough.</v>

140
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Instant poll where the family barely making ends meet.</v>

141
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Edwin's drinking was also still not under control.</v>

142
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.511
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion,</v>

143
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:38.640
<v Speaker 1>the media found a bottle of whiskey and her father's suitcase and proceeded to</v>

144
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:42.150
<v Speaker 1>empty it into the kitchen sink and infuriated Edwin and tried to slap the Gal,</v>

145
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but any stops him.</v>

146
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 1>The constant moves that have family undertook during her teen years.</v>

147
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Left Emilia feeling rootless and insecure,</v>

148
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but rather than discussing her problems,</v>

149
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 1>she instead focused on her ambitions.</v>

150
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>The family only stayed in support for year with the job awaiting Edwin and the</v>

151
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>claims office of the Burlington railway,</v>

152
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>they relocated to Springfield,</v>

153
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Missouri.</v>

154
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.003
<v Speaker 1>The move though,</v>

155
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>it was a disaster.</v>

156
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>After a seven hour train journey,</v>

157
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>the family discovered that the job had already been taken for amy.</v>

158
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>This was the final Straw.</v>

159
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>She demanded a trial separation and took the two girls to Chicago to stay with</v>

160
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 1>old family friends in Chicago.</v>

161
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Emilia shouldered responsibility for her mother and sister as head of the</v>

162
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>

163
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Her behavior and terror appearance changed dramatically,</v>

164
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>although usually attended Hyde Park,</v>

165
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>the best public high school in Chicago.</v>

166
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>She did not participate in any of the numerous clubs that the school offered,</v>

167
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>nor did she play any of the sports that she so loved.</v>

168
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>She now referred to herself as a.</v>

169
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>He was isolated herself from her fellow students.</v>

170
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.210
<v Speaker 1>She refused to attend the senior banquet,</v>

171
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>some graduation ceremony,</v>

172
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>a senior yearbook photo caption,</v>

173
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>read the girl in Brown who walks alone by the fall of 1915.</v>

174
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Though things have improved in their heart marriage,</v>

175
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Edwin had stopped drinking and the family had reunited in Kansas City for the</v>

176
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.330
<v Speaker 1>next year.</v>

177
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Emilia did not attend school,</v>

178
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>but spends her time acting as a buffer between her parents and hoping to</v>

179
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>preserve the marriage.</v>

180
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>The family fortunes took an immediate turn when any received an inheritance.</v>

181
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>She used some of the funds to send Emilia to the Oregon is finishing school on</v>

182
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 1>the outskirts of Philadelphia.</v>

183
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>It was there that Emilia polished her social graces which would allow her to</v>

184
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>move with ease and poise among all segments of society after she became famous</v>

185
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>at the age of 19.</v>

186
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>She was the oldest of the students at the finishing school when she entered in</v>

187
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>the fall of 1916.</v>

188
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 1>While she was there,</v>

189
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Amelia's feminist proclivities came to the fore.</v>

190
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.780
<v Speaker 1>She gets a newspaper clipping file,</v>

191
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>have accomplished women,</v>

192
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>many of them firsts in their fields,</v>

193
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but she was no suffragettes.</v>

194
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Next one clipping.</v>

195
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>She wrote,</v>

196
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>women will gain economic justice by proving themselves in all lines of endeavor,</v>

197
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 1>not by having laws passed for them.</v>

198
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Over the first semester,</v>

199
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Christmas break,</v>

200
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Emilia returned home.</v>

201
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>While that she witnessed the ravages of the first world war returned soldiers on</v>

202
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the street with missing limbs or had been blinders or had been otherwise names.</v>

203
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>She returned to the finishing school,</v>

204
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>but she felt conflicted.</v>

205
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.580
<v Speaker 1>She wrote to her mother,</v>

206
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't bear the thought of going back to school and being so useless.</v>

207
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Emilia decided to quit the school and enrolled in a course to join a voluntary</v>

208
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 1>aid detachments,</v>

209
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>a group of civilians who served as assistant nurses,</v>

210
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>ambulance drivers,</v>

211
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and regular nurses.</v>

212
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>After several months of training,</v>

213
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>sister Amelia,</v>

214
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:13.484
<v Speaker 1>as she was known,</v>

215
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>was posted to Spadina military hospital on the campus of the University of</v>

216
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>

217
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.890
<v Speaker 1>working there until just before the armistice in 1918.</v>

218
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>She cared for soldiers who had been poisoned by gas and otherwise injured in the</v>

219
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>trenches of the western front.</v>

220
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>She also looks after pilots from the Royal Flying Corps,</v>

221
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

222
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>who had crashed in Europe.</v>

223
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>It was while tending to these injured pilots that Emilia became fascinated with</v>

224
00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the idea of flying.</v>

225
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>The men would trade stories about their exploits high above the ground nearby.</v>

226
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It was the Royal Flying Corps base and the skies were filled with hundreds of</v>

227
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:44.991
<v Speaker 1>planes.</v>

228
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:45.824
<v Speaker 1>Buzzing rounds.</v>

229
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Civilians were not allowed to fly in the planes,</v>

230
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>but on their days off,</v>

231
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Emilia spent time with the pilots and attended area exhibitions.</v>

232
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Now the hospital job,</v>

233
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.400
<v Speaker 1>it was intensely demanding with Emilia,</v>

234
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>often working 12 hour shifts.</v>

235
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 1>She became so worn down this in the summer of 1918.</v>

236
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>She came down with influenza and pneumonia and developed painful scientists,</v>

237
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

238
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>As a result of this,</v>

239
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>she suffered from chronic sinus infections for the rest of her life.</v>

240
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>After a period of convalescence with our mother,</v>

241
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>immediately enrolled at Columbia University studying zoology,</v>

242
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

243
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>and chemistry.</v>

244
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>She rented a modest apartment in New York City at the end of the spring term,</v>

245
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>though she quit her studies,</v>

246
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>she would like to claim that she had simply decided against a medical career.</v>

247
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>The reality was that she lacks the temperament to wade through years of tertiary</v>

248
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>study spending the next year with our parents in Los Angeles.</v>

249
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Amenia put her focus on helping them keep their marriage and tax over the course</v>

250
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:36.250
<v Speaker 1>of that year,</v>

251
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.670
<v Speaker 1>but now 22 year old Emilia,</v>

252
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll take our first paying job,</v>

253
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>drive a fast car,</v>

254
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.470
<v Speaker 1>and fly a first plane.</v>

255
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles in 1920 was a haven for pilots.</v>

256
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It was full of barnstormers pilots who stunted in asset classes and gave rides.</v>

257
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Do often terrified passengers.</v>

258
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.920
<v Speaker 1>In December of Nineteen Twenty Emilia ends,</v>

259
00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>her father went to an Air Rodeo in long beach where pilots performed,</v>

260
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:08.601
<v Speaker 1>spins and dives amid a crowd of spectators the next day and wouldn't pay $10 to</v>

261
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>give his daughter our first passenger flights,</v>

262
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>a 10 minute ride over the Hollywood hills the moment the plane left the grounds</v>

263
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>she knew that she herself has to fly.</v>

264
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>It was at that moment,</v>

265
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but she knew she had found her calling without telling her parents,</v>

266
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Emilia signed up for flying lessons with the expectation that Edwin would cover</v>

267
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.230
<v Speaker 1>the $500 feet,</v>

268
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>but my father had no interest in his daughter's newfound obsession and she was</v>

269
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 1>forced to find a job as a telephone clock in order to fund the lessons.</v>

270
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>She chose to be instructed by a female pilots and Nita Nita Snook.</v>

271
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 1>After 10 hours of lessons,</v>

272
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 1>the media went solo in 1921.</v>

273
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.550
<v Speaker 1>The exhilarating experience encouraged to onto achieving a full pilot's license</v>

274
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 1>over the next few months.</v>

275
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>As she progressed in her lessons,</v>

276
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Emilia became an airfield junkie.</v>

277
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.610
<v Speaker 1>She cropped her long hair and to began wearing breeches boots and an oil stains</v>

278
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:57.440
<v Speaker 1>that the jacket,</v>

279
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the spline complaining about the high cost of lessons she managed to scrape</v>

280
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>together the money to buy a fast plane.</v>

281
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>This was thanks largely to her mother's inheritance.</v>

282
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>This plane was an Esta with a 28 foot wingspan.</v>

283
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Indeed it was the second Esta ever built,</v>

284
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>renamed this plane canary.</v>

285
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 1>During these early years,</v>

286
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Amelia didn't consider herself a good enough flyer to appear in public events.</v>

287
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

288
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 1>her humility didn't preclude a few appearances to shows and two attempts at</v>

289
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>record setting in the La area.</v>

290
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>The press was also beginning to mention her as one of the few women pilots in</v>

291
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>the area.</v>

292
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 1>By 1923,</v>

293
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 1>she had turned into a confident pilots that she was not a natural flower and</v>

294
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>struggled throughout our instruction.</v>

295
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Many men and even some women were pilots than Emilia,</v>

296
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>but that persistence and so bravery cetera pass.</v>

297
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.001
<v Speaker 1>In 19,</v>

298
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:42.580
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>

299
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Amelia's parents,</v>

300
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 1>marriage finally ended in divorce,</v>

301
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>a devastated Emilia saw no reason to stay in California and she relocated to</v>

302
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Boston along with her mother and her sister.</v>

303
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>The following year,</v>

304
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 1>she re enrolled at Columbia,</v>

305
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>switching to majoring in engineering.</v>

306
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.350
<v Speaker 1>That's when she scored a c minus in Algebra.</v>

307
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 1>She wants again,</v>

308
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.883
<v Speaker 1>quit her studies.</v>

309
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>She then applied for admittance to mit,</v>

310
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but was turned down</v>

311
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.540
<v Speaker 1>over the next few years.</v>

312
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean he works as a number of menial jobs.</v>

313
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Eventually she ended up as a social worker at a settlement house in Boston in</v>

314
00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:16.710
<v Speaker 1>1928.</v>

315
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Her three year hiatus from flying ended when she agreed to take a seat as a</v>

316
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>passenger in log keeper on a flight from New York to London.</v>

317
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.780
<v Speaker 1>The plane was a Fokker f seven,</v>

318
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.660
<v Speaker 1>the three meter float plane piloted by Miss Stoltz.</v>

319
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.450
<v Speaker 1>The flight plane took off on the morning of June the 17th,</v>

320
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.001
<v Speaker 1>then arrived,</v>

321
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.560
<v Speaker 1>did Barry Points in south Wales nearly at 21 hours later,</v>

322
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.810
<v Speaker 1>despite her role being a minimal one,</v>

323
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Emilia was now in the books as the first woman to fly.</v>

324
00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:40.800
<v Speaker 1>The North Atlantic,</v>

325
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>resounding to the USA.</v>

326
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Emilia developed a close relationship with George Putnam and New York</v>

327
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.670
<v Speaker 1>businessmen and form a publisher.</v>

328
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.310
<v Speaker 1>They had mess when she had interviewed for a place on the APP.</v>

329
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Putnam helped to improve our flying skills and to embark on a series of lecture</v>

330
00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:58.470
<v Speaker 1>tours intended to promote the aircraft industry and to encourage women to become</v>

331
00:12:58.471 --> 00:12:59.250
<v Speaker 1>pilots.</v>

332
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Over the next few months.</v>

333
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.310
<v Speaker 1>She wrote her first autobiography,</v>

334
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.210
<v Speaker 1>20 hours,</v>

335
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes about a flight across the North Atlantic.</v>

336
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.470
<v Speaker 1>On November the 22nd 19,</v>

337
00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:11.580
<v Speaker 1>29 Emilia Saturday women's speed record for a single engine monoplane.</v>

338
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.361
<v Speaker 1>The following year,</v>

339
00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:16.740
<v Speaker 1>she purchased a Lockheed Vega executive and in it she broke the speed record for</v>

340
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:18.270
<v Speaker 1>a course of 100 kilometers.</v>

341
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Emilia and George Putnam were married on the seventh of February,</v>

342
00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:21.810
<v Speaker 1>1931.</v>

343
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Over that next year.</v>

344
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.580
<v Speaker 1>She sat and spoke at several altitude records on the 20th of May,</v>

345
00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:27.391
<v Speaker 1>1932.</v>

346
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:29.370
<v Speaker 1>She took off from newfoundlands in her vega,</v>

347
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.010
<v Speaker 1>touching down in a field of cows in Londonderry,</v>

348
00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>

349
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen hours and 30 minutes later she had just become the first woman to fly</v>

350
00:13:36.811 --> 00:13:38.610
<v Speaker 1>solo across the North Atlantic</v>

351
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.560
<v Speaker 1>with her husband's flair for publicity.</v>

352
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 1>She quickly became the most famous woman flyer on the planet's Portland build</v>

353
00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:51.260
<v Speaker 1>his wife as lady Lindy,</v>

354
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.050
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on the massive popularity of Charles Lindbergh.</v>

355
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Immediate was now a fully fledged celebrity when she made public appearances.</v>

356
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.590
<v Speaker 1>She needed police protection.</v>

357
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.960
<v Speaker 1>She bronch downs by designing a range of clothing.</v>

358
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.810
<v Speaker 1>There's coffee table look in January of 1935,</v>

359
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:06.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean the.</v>

360
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I became the first woman to fly from Hawaii to California in that he or she also</v>

361
00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.630
<v Speaker 1>wrote our second biography,</v>

362
00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the front of this while continuing a hectic schedule of lecture tours and public</v>

363
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:16.274
<v Speaker 1>appearances.</v>

364
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.720
<v Speaker 1>On July the 20th,</v>

365
00:14:23.721 --> 00:14:24.770
<v Speaker 1>1935,</v>

366
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Emilia celebrated her 38th birthday.</v>

367
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.080
<v Speaker 1>She knew that she couldn't go on breaking records forever.</v>

368
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

369
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.870
<v Speaker 1>she still had one more big ones and knockoff.</v>

370
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

371
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.670
<v Speaker 1>it was the biggest of them all and that's of course a flight around the world.</v>

372
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.410
<v Speaker 1>To achieve a round the world flight.</v>

373
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Amelia would need a bigger plane.</v>

374
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.710
<v Speaker 1>In early 1936,</v>

375
00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:44.180
<v Speaker 1>she purchased a twin engine,</v>

376
00:14:44.181 --> 00:14:46.430
<v Speaker 1>lucky 10 e electric airplane.</v>

377
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:49.400
<v Speaker 1>That was the product of the finest technology available at the time.</v>

378
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>It was a low wing monoplane of metal construction with constant speed propellers</v>

379
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>powered by to Pratt Whitney,</v>

380
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>wast [inaudible] 14,</v>

381
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>550 horsepower engines.</v>

382
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.650
<v Speaker 1>The interior of the plane was modified to take extra petrol tanks giving a</v>

383
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 1>theoretical range of 4,000 miles as announced to use of 4,000 feet.</v>

384
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>The plane was also fitted with one of the very first sperry automatic pilots in</v>

385
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 1>order to relieve the physical strain of flying on Emilia.</v>

386
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Despite this innovation,</v>

387
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 1>it became apparent that Emilia words need navigational assistance to fly across</v>

388
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific Ocean or navigational knowledge was rudimentary and so Irish bond</v>

389
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>navigator Fred Noonan,</v>

390
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>was recruited for the world record attempts.</v>

391
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Noonan was keen to be involved,</v>

392
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but that was one aspect of the navigational set that he wasn't happy with.</v>

393
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 1>The only way the navigator could reach the pilot was by crawling along a catwalk</v>

394
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 1>over the intervening fuel tanks.</v>

395
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.040
<v Speaker 1>All system was devised.</v>

396
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Web I resend messages,</v>

397
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>could be clipped to the line of a bamboo fishing pole and passed between them,</v>

398
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 1>but this inadequate method in pad,</v>

399
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 1>the crucial element of teamwork,</v>

400
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.340
<v Speaker 1>the plan's route for the round the world flies began in Oakland,</v>

401
00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:03.130
<v Speaker 1>California with the first landing place in Honolulu,</v>

402
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii from them.</v>

403
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It continues in a westerly direction,</v>

404
00:16:06.701 --> 00:16:10.120
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage of prevailing winds in order to maximize publicity.</v>

405
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Partner required his wife to keep a detailed diary and post entry stem from each</v>

406
00:16:14.101 --> 00:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

407
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.800
<v Speaker 1>He would edit them so he could rush out the book as soon as she achieved the</v>

408
00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:18.340
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>

409
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Now the first leg of the round,</v>

410
00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the world flight took off from Oakland's at 1630 on march the 17th,</v>

411
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:24.310
<v Speaker 1>1937.</v>

412
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>The flight to Honolulu,</v>

413
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it was smooth and uneventful,</v>

414
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.200
<v Speaker 1>taking 15 hours and 47 minutes.</v>

415
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.010
<v Speaker 1>The next stop was to be the tiny American territory of Holland island,</v>

416
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.020
<v Speaker 1>1,800 miles away.</v>

417
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Immediately things went wrong.</v>

418
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.800
<v Speaker 1>The plane swung to the rice just after to take off.</v>

419
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Then grounds looping.</v>

420
00:16:39.971 --> 00:16:41.410
<v Speaker 1>As the undercarriage collapsed.</v>

421
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

422
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Emilia managed to land without any injury or fire,</v>

423
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but the world record attempt had to be put on hold as the plane was created and</v>

424
00:16:48.881 --> 00:16:50.590
<v Speaker 1>sent back to Lockheed for rebuilding.</v>

425
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.570
<v Speaker 1>The rebuilding was completed on May.</v>

426
00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>The 17th efforts were made to reduce the weight of the plane,</v>

427
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.020
<v Speaker 1>one of which undoubtedly contributed to the tragedy that was to come,</v>

428
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.030
<v Speaker 1>the trailing area,</v>

429
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.000
<v Speaker 1>which allowed them to request a bearings on 500 kilohertz from ground stations</v>

430
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>was removed three days after the rebuilds electra was delivered to them,</v>

431
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Emilia Ans Noonan took off from Oakland's for the second time because of</v>

432
00:17:11.951 --> 00:17:12.850
<v Speaker 1>seasonal changes.</v>

433
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It was decided that this new attempt would be done in the reverse direction.</v>

434
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.930
<v Speaker 1>The first link was to Miami and then onto Puerto Rico,</v>

435
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

436
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Dodge Guinea,</v>

437
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.470
<v Speaker 1>and in early June if you ones in Brazil,</v>

438
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.311
<v Speaker 1>the following days,</v>

439
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:27.160
<v Speaker 1>we spent servicing the engines and checking the instruments.</v>

440
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.660
<v Speaker 1>The 1,900 mile flight across the South Atlantic was made on the seventh of June,</v>

441
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.830
<v Speaker 1>landing the car,</v>

442
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Senegal Virginie across Africa and it for days it was followed by the longest</v>

443
00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:39.850
<v Speaker 1>leg of 1,950 kilometers,</v>

444
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.020
<v Speaker 1>do karate and India.</v>

445
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.520
<v Speaker 1>There the plane was serviced by Imperial Airways along with members of the</v>

446
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.690
<v Speaker 1>British Raf on June the 17th.</v>

447
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 1>If you want to dumb dumb near cal Calacatta landing in the middle of a</v>

448
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 1>torrential rainstorm after refueling of Bangkok,</v>

449
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.370
<v Speaker 1>if you want to Singapore,</v>

450
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 1>from there as onto bang done in Java here,</v>

451
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 1>the electric develop some kinds of instrument false on the flight to Sarah buyer</v>

452
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:00.081
<v Speaker 1>in East Java.</v>

453
00:18:00.081 --> 00:18:02.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem reoccurred forcing them back to Bandung,</v>

454
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 1>whether where repair facilities on June the 29th they flew to lie in New Guinea,</v>

455
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 1>the 1,200 mile flight was completed in seven hours and 43 minutes so far the</v>

456
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.400
<v Speaker 1>paranoid traveled 22,000 miles.</v>

457
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.860
<v Speaker 1>The Pam must have been extremely tired by this point,</v>

458
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but the greatest challenge,</v>

459
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>it's still lay ahead of them and that was of course crossing the Pacific.</v>

460
00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.810
<v Speaker 1>The next objective was howland island,</v>

461
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:33.430
<v Speaker 1>some 2,566 miles away.</v>

462
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.550
<v Speaker 1>The two spans June the 30th in preparation for the mammoth flight,</v>

463
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.411
<v Speaker 1>several witnesses,</v>

464
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:40.660
<v Speaker 1>so they should reported that a noonan was drinking heavily on this day and we're</v>

465
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.130
<v Speaker 1>still doing so in the evening.</v>

466
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.020
<v Speaker 1>As Emilia attended a dinner party,</v>

467
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.820
<v Speaker 1>they took off at 10:00 AM on July.</v>

468
00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:49.360
<v Speaker 1>The second eye witnesses reported that the Electra lifted off sluggishly,</v>

469
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 1>sang downwards towards the sea,</v>

470
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.570
<v Speaker 1>and then began a very slow claim to the east and no one ever saw them again.</v>

471
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.840
<v Speaker 1>The last known position of the electro was near the Nigga manny violence.</v>

472
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.820
<v Speaker 1>The last radio message from Amelia was,</v>

473
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:01.870
<v Speaker 1>we must be on you,</v>

474
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 1>but gas is running low.</v>

475
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Have been unable to reach you by radio.</v>

476
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.120
<v Speaker 1>We are flying at 1000 feet.</v>

477
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 1>The official search efforts to find the missing plane and it's famous occupants</v>

478
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>lasted until July the 19th,</v>

479
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 1>1937.</v>

480
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.930
<v Speaker 1>The RNC search by the US Navy and Coast Guard was the most expensive in u.</v>

481
00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:24.764
<v Speaker 1>s history,</v>

482
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 1>still no physical evidence of the plane or the remains of Emilia in Newnan</v>

483
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.400
<v Speaker 1>wherever found over the decades the speculation over what happened to Amelia</v>

484
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>earhart has intensified in 2017.</v>

485
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:38.580
<v Speaker 1>A photo emerged that purported to show we're back view of Emilia and sitting on</v>

486
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 1>a pier in the Marshall Islands.</v>

487
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

488
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.580
<v Speaker 1>this photo was debunked when it was proven that it was actually taken in 1935 to</v>

489
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 1>years before Amelia disappeared.</v>

490
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Then in March of 2018 and anthropology,</v>

491
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>professor at the University of Tennessee named Richard Jensen argue to the</v>

492
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:52.981
<v Speaker 1>bones,</v>

493
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 1>found on the islands of Nikki,</v>

494
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 1>my in 1940,</v>

495
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.830
<v Speaker 1>where 99 percent likely to be those of Amelia earhart.</v>

496
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.310
<v Speaker 1>The bones were analyzed in 1941 and determined to be those via mail,</v>

497
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 1>but John's believes that that analysis was deeply flawed.</v>

498
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

499
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 1>other scientists uphold the original findings.</v>

500
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.450
<v Speaker 1>While we may never know what really happened to you immediately,</v>

501
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 1>it depends quite certain that's the tantalizing mystery of her disappearance.</v>

502
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:16.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

503
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 1>keep her name in the headlines for many years to come,</v>
