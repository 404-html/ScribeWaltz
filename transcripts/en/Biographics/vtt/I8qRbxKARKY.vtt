1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.200
<v Speaker 1>He's the man who kills a king.</v>

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.831
<v Speaker 1>All of a chrome,</v>

3
00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:03.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4
00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>the English puritan sounds,</v>

5
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>military dictator is today most famous for signing the death warrants that led</v>

6
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>to Charles the first bloody execution in 1649 over a hundred years before the</v>

7
00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>American and French revolutions shook the globe.</v>

8
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>This small time British farmer from the British sticks proved with steel,</v>

9
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>the divine right of kings was not so holy after all.</v>

10
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>What possessed a guy who worked in agriculture to drop his tools one day and go</v>

11
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>and commit regicide?</v>

12
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>The story is even more fascinating than you probably think from his humble</v>

13
00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:33.641
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds.</v>

14
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Cranwell would rise to become a leading puritan and tireless advocate of</v>

15
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>religious freedom even as you committed war crimes on the battlefields of</v>

16
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>islands and pursued personal empowerment with a terrifying zeal.</v>

17
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>And I'd also some I go to others.</v>

18
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>This is the true story of the man who spearheaded England's civil war.</v>

19
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Like many great amount of history,</v>

20
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:08.231
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a crumb.</v>

21
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Well was born into surprisingly modest circumstances,</v>

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>well modest for the 90 classes of Britain who in the dying days of the 16th</v>

23
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>century were the only ones who really mattered.</v>

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>The second of 10 children.</v>

25
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Young Oliver was the product of a Protestant family that has done well out of</v>

26
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>the reformation seven decades earlier,</v>

27
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>rising from brewers do owners of a smaller state.</v>

28
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 1>He could trace a family link back to Henry.</v>

29
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>The eighth adviser,</v>

30
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Cromwellian and his nearby grandfather frequently entertains James the</v>

31
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>first rail hunting party.</v>

32
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Young old liver may not have been rich,</v>

33
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but he was certainly well connected.</v>

34
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>He was also growing up in the shadow of Britain's most notorious terrorist</v>

35
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 1>attack in 1605 vengeful Catholics had gunpowder beneath the House of Lords</v>

36
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>intending to blow up the king.</v>

37
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>The pilot's discovery fired off a wave of anti-catholic fervor across England.</v>

38
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Something this may well have helps form young Oliver's strict Protestant outlook</v>

39
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>terrorism side,</v>

40
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>though the reign of James the first was mostly stable and all of the lives,</v>

41
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 1>a mostly stable life.</v>

42
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>You attended school,</v>

43
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.910
<v Speaker 1>spent a year at Cambridge University.</v>

44
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>They need to be forced to return to the family's east Anglia estate.</v>

45
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>After his father died in 1620 he married Elizabeth [inaudible] and does that</v>

46
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>really should have been that.</v>

47
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

48
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>in 1625 something happens that would act as a catalyst for all the bloodshed</v>

49
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>there was about to follow.</v>

50
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>On March the 27th James the first died,</v>

51
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 1>his son Charles the first inherited the throne.</v>

52
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It was the start of a long march towards catastrophe.</v>

53
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Charles the first was by most accounts they're shy and draw the sweet fellow in</v>

54
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 1>private in public.</v>

55
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>He was everything that growing pirouettes and movements in England feared his</v>

56
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>wife was a catholic.</v>

57
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>He supported a form of Anglicanism that appear dangerously close to Catholicism.</v>

58
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.401
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

59
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And he was super keen on raising taxes to send his friend,</v>

60
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Lord Bucking and gala van zing off to fight foreign wars that England did not a</v>

61
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>chance of winning.</v>

62
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>When the new king convened his first Parliament in 1625 it became known as the</v>

63
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>useless parliaments because its members refuse to vote through those new taxes</v>

64
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>that Charles wanted.</v>

65
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And I Charles dissolve the parliaments after just 12 days.</v>

66
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>One yet later he tried again only for the mps do also refuse to raise taxes that</v>

67
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>would be wasted on Buckingham's boneheaded back narrowing.</v>

68
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.801
<v Speaker 1>So once again,</v>

69
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Charles dissolved parliament and by the way,</v>

70
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>get ready to hear that sentence a lot.</v>

71
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>London was indulging in high politics back in east Anglia.</v>

73
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.381
<v Speaker 1>I'll ever chrome.</v>

74
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:33.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>it was in the grip of eight severe spiritual illness,</v>

76
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>plagued for years,</v>

77
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>like serious depression.</v>

78
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>He finally slipped into a funk one night that became a fever and that nearly</v>

79
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>became death when he finally recovered.</v>

80
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>He was a changed man.</v>

81
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Cromwells would later describe as experiences emerging from darkness into light,</v>

82
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the light of puritanism.</v>

83
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>From then on,</v>

84
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>he would be a staunch defender of the puritan faith.</v>

85
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>The road to Damascus style conversion.</v>

86
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Me explain what happened next.</v>

87
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>In 1628 Charles the first decided once again to try raising taxes and cold.</v>

88
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

89
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>another parliaments.</v>

90
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>This time Cranwell decided to join using those connections that we talked about</v>

91
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

92
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>He managed to literally get himself a front row seats to the most explosive</v>

93
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>parliaments in decades.</v>

94
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>By 1628 Charles had resulted to extracting money from his subjects of sorta</v>

95
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 1>points known as forced loans.</v>

96
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They were as unpopular as daylight.</v>

97
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Robbery tends to be,</v>

98
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>and it became even more so when bucking him,</v>

99
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>use the money and not just for disastrous adventures in Spain,</v>

100
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.981
<v Speaker 1>but also to launch an identically disastrous war with France that Charles had</v>

101
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>resulted due locking up mps who refuse to pay,</v>

102
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>only added fuel to the dumps.</v>

103
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Defy.</v>

104
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>That was now the new parliament.</v>

105
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>As a young chrome,</v>

106
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:50.321
<v Speaker 1>well looked on,</v>

107
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Charles refused to accept the new parliament succession of the rights to refuse</v>

108
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>unwarranted taxation.</v>

109
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Parliament blamed Buckingham for influencing the king.</v>

110
00:04:58.751 --> 00:04:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>if a young army officer to then assassinate Nord boneheads Jarls blamed nps for</v>

112
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>the death of his friends and you guessed it,</v>

113
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>he does all phenomenons.</v>

114
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>He did this in something of a fit of Pique and that peak,</v>

115
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.744
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

116
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>lost it for 11 years.</v>

117
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640
<v Speaker 1>No parliament would sit from March of 1629 to April of 1640 this barrier became</v>

118
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>known as the years of personal rule for chrome.</v>

119
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:23.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>personal rule was tough.</v>

121
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Sean of his parliamentary standing,</v>

122
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>he wound up losing contact with his old network,</v>

123
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>selling his property and taking on a small farm in Cambridgeshire to survive.</v>

124
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>By 1636 crumb was a broke unimportant.</v>

125
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:41.881
<v Speaker 1>Nobody with zero prospects even considered emigrating to America and joining in</v>

126
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>with a pilgrims.</v>

127
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully the 16 fatties closed with do bits of good luck for Cranwell first in</v>

128
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>1636 is fabulously wealthy.</v>

129
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Childless uncle died and left Oliver everything.</v>

130
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Seconds in 1639 Charles the fest at something Spec stupid.</v>

131
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.940
<v Speaker 1>He tried to force his religious beliefs on Scotland and downtime.</v>

132
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Scotland had been in union with England and Wales for less than 40 years.</v>

133
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Scott's still worshiped presbytarian style with none of the fancy stuff.</v>

134
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>So beloved of Charles.</v>

135
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>When Charles tried to ram his religious reforms through the Scots,</v>

136
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>they went nuts,</v>

137
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>known as the bishops was the following battle,</v>

138
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>saw Scotland invade and occupying northern England.</v>

139
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Charles sued for peace and the Scott said essentially,</v>

140
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>sure on two conditions.</v>

141
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

142
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>no more of this fancy religious Bollix and to pay us all of our war expenses.</v>

143
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>So you're completely broke with an occupying army in the nation's north.</v>

144
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Charles was forced to grit his teeth and summon another parliaments.</v>

145
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>This attempt would go even worse than all of his others.</v>

146
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Speaker 1>The parliaments of 1640 got off to a farcical stars known as the short</v>

147
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:55.061
<v Speaker 1>parliament.</v>

148
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:55.451
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

149
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it lasted only three weeks before.</v>

150
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

151
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Charles dissolved parliament,</v>

152
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but there was still broke.</v>

153
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:02.011
<v Speaker 1>So he called for you.</v>

154
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I said another parliament just six months later.</v>

155
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And finally we reached the end of our run of Charles dissolving things because</v>

156
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:13.711
<v Speaker 1>the second vitamins of 1640 isn't known physically as the long parliament.</v>

157
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Although the long parliament wasn't a straight revival of the 1628 parliament,</v>

158
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>it did feature some familiar faces.</v>

159
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Among them was Oliver Cromwell.</v>

160
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Now with influential puritan with new connections,</v>

161
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Crum well became MP for Cambridge during the 11 years of personal rule,</v>

162
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 1>had lost his shyness in the first week of the long parliaments.</v>

163
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>He made an impassioned speech attacking the king's imprisonments of freeborn</v>

164
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.210
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>

165
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>In the seconds he launched a ferocious broadside at Charles is his attempts to</v>

166
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.480
<v Speaker 1>force his brand of Christianity upon his people.</v>

167
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.800
<v Speaker 1>While the speeches were hardly Mencken or church or they were passionate enough,</v>

168
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.600
<v Speaker 1>that crumb well began to get noticed while an ax putting some of Charles's taxes</v>

169
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 1>on a legal footing kept to the king's somewhat happy.</v>

170
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Parliaments also passed bills accusing his advisors of treason and making it</v>

171
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 1>illegal for Charles to dissolve parliaments without their consent.</v>

172
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

173
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:07.480
<v Speaker 1>and they also attacked his Catholic wife because that's just how things are.</v>

174
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:09.730
<v Speaker 1>How they went down in 17th century person.</v>

175
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.060
<v Speaker 1>By 1641 things had completely deteriorated as if a war had erupted in Ireland's</v>

176
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.980
<v Speaker 1>a royalist coup had been crushed in Scotland.</v>

177
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Then parliament wins and presented Charles with something called the grands.</v>

178
00:08:21.881 --> 00:08:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Remonstrance.</v>

179
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.020
<v Speaker 1>This was basically a top 10 list with the title of the reasons we hate you.</v>

180
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:27.610
<v Speaker 1>You stupid tyrants,</v>

181
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>never imagine to take criticism.</v>

182
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:29.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Charles became convinced that this was all a puritan plot against him.</v>

184
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.290
<v Speaker 1>On January the fourth 1642 Charles led a group of soldiers into the House of</v>

185
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Commons to arrest five prominent mps.</v>

186
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

187
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it's unprecedented in English history,</v>

188
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.343
<v Speaker 1>but the Mvs,</v>

189
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.920
<v Speaker 1>they weren't there that had been tipped off and flat embarrassed,</v>

190
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>convinced the world was against him.</v>

191
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Charles left for London on January the 10th when he arrived in his traditional</v>

192
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>haven of Oxford.</v>

193
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>He began raising an army.</v>

194
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.731
<v Speaker 1>In March,</v>

195
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>parliament voted to raise their own.</v>

196
00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.873
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

197
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>everyone met a fairly good idea of where this was heading.</v>

198
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>In August,</v>

199
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>1642 the first English civil war finally began pitching royalist forces against</v>

200
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>parliaments army.</v>

201
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It would ultimately lead to some 200,000 deaths.</v>

202
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for most,</v>

203
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 1>but not all for Oliver Cromwell.</v>

204
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>This would be the moment when he stepped out of the shadows into the blinding</v>

205
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.690
<v Speaker 1>light of history from the get go chrome.</v>

206
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

207
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it was at the heart of the war,</v>

208
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>even though he was just a farmer with no fighting experience.</v>

209
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 1>One of the very first engagements of the conflicts came when he successfully</v>

210
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>garrison Cambridge against a royalist attack,</v>

211
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>but it would be at the battle of edge hill in October where chrome well really</v>

212
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 1>became a soldier.</v>

213
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>The battle was a stalemate,</v>

214
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 1>but chrome well was able to witness firsthand the effectiveness of the</v>

215
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.111
<v Speaker 1>royalists.</v>

216
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Horse mounted troops convinced the parliamentarians needed cavalry to win the</v>

217
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

218
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>He had his back to east Anglia to raise a mounted army.</v>

219
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to overstate how effective Cromwells horseman would</v>

220
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>

221
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 1>By mid 1643 they'd security Stankonia for parliaments in 1644 of the wipes the</v>

222
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 1>floor with Charles,</v>

223
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>his own amount of troops at the battle of mustard more chrome well was such a</v>

224
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>natural leader of men that he was soon promoted to leftenant general and given</v>

225
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 1>the nickname iron sight has men work professional disciplines and loyal</v>

226
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>qualities sorely lacking in the rest of the parliamentary Ami.</v>

227
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

228
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 1>it was Cromwells obvious military skill that stops him from exiting the story.</v>

229
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

230
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>fed up with XRS to Kratz leading their army.</v>

231
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:34.551
<v Speaker 1>Parliament passed a motion in 1645 to kick every MP and Lord out of the military</v>

232
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>as MP Crockwell should have been among the parliament,</v>

233
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 1>passed a second law allowing him to continue serving on to a new leader,</v>

234
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Fairfax.</v>

235
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They knew that winning the war rested on Cromwells cavalry.</v>

236
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 1>In 1645 Cromwells horseman played the decisive role at the battle of Nazeem.</v>

237
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Here they effectively wipes out the royalist army.</v>

238
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Charles held firm for another year,</v>

239
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 1>but in 1646 Cromwells took his stronghold of Oxford.</v>

240
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Charles floods into the night disguised as a seven.</v>

241
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He traveled north and threw himself on the mercy of his old enemies.</v>

242
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.520
<v Speaker 1>The Scots.</v>

243
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.221
<v Speaker 1>That's surprising me.</v>

244
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>This got straight at him doing glands and with that,</v>

245
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:12.230
<v Speaker 1>the first English civil war was over</v>

246
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 1>remarkably for a regicide or dictates that at well responded to Charles's</v>

247
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.840
<v Speaker 1>capture by trying to force parliament to cut a deal with him.</v>

248
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Cromwells sincerely believed that the only way forward was to restore Charles</v>

249
00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the first of the throne,</v>

250
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.290
<v Speaker 1>only with a new constitution in place to stop him running around and raising</v>

251
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:37.240
<v Speaker 1>taxes and dissolving parliaments.</v>

252
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.200
<v Speaker 1>The hero of the parliamentary cause even droid a rebellion against parliament</v>

253
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.330
<v Speaker 1>that year using his influence to four sounds,</v>

254
00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:46.390
<v Speaker 1>11 presbytarian nps that he considered anti Yami.</v>

255
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.410
<v Speaker 1>If Charles the first had been just at a little bit less of a start on ass,</v>

256
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.560
<v Speaker 1>it would have all ended right at sadly being an ass was Charles was old about</v>

257
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>despite losing the war,</v>

258
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>he refused to accept any deal with parliaments.</v>

259
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Instead he got a secret deal with the Scots to make the whole of Britain</v>

260
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:08.821
<v Speaker 1>presbytarian if they're just invade and restore him to the throne and the Scots.</v>

261
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 1>They agreed and so we come to the embarrassments.</v>

262
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.320
<v Speaker 1>That is the second English civil war.</v>

263
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Embarrassing because of it's farcical,</v>

264
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>lack of coordination.</v>

265
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's stop risings paralyzed Wales and southern England in 1648 but the Scott's</v>

266
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>didn't invade until Cromwells well and Fairfax's.</v>

267
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>He subdued them in August.</v>

268
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

269
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 1>road north met the Scottish Armenians.</v>

270
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Annihilated adds so much for that.</v>

271
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 1>However that what two important outcomes from this second dustup.</v>

272
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>The first was that the army forcibly purged parliament of Mbas who didn't</v>

273
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 1>support Cromwellian Fairfax.</v>

274
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>This severely reduced lung parliaments became known as the rump.</v>

275
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>The second was that Charles,</v>

276
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 1>his role in the Scottish invasion was inevitably discovered.</v>

277
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>We've Cromwells blessing the rump drags.</v>

278
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:53.291
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>

279
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>before Isans held a mock trial,</v>

280
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:55.901
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>

281
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 1>he was sentenced to death,</v>

282
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>the 59 MBS,</v>

283
00:12:58.571 --> 00:12:59.271
<v Speaker 1>including chrome,</v>

284
00:12:59.271 --> 00:12:59.801
<v Speaker 1>well dead,</v>

285
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>to put their names on the execution order.</v>

286
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>On January the 30th 1649 Charles was publicly executed in London.</v>

287
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>His head lopped off and hell's a loft for the crowds to see unpopular as he</v>

288
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:11.510
<v Speaker 1>wants to.</v>

289
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>It's thought Omnia a hundred I'll say men in the whole of England wanted to see</v>

290
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 1>him debt.</v>

291
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just a shame for Charles that one of those men happened to be all if a</v>

292
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Commonweal.</v>

293
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

294
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Powerful as chrome.</v>

295
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Well was at this stage.</v>

296
00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just transition straight to Ruder of Britain.</v>

297
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>After Charles died,</v>

298
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it was the rump that now held supremacy and chrome well was pretty fine with</v>

299
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

300
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.400
<v Speaker 1>They supported his army and besides history,</v>

301
00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it's still had one major task for him in 1650 chrome.</v>

302
00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

303
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.420
<v Speaker 1>it was sent to end the Irish war.</v>

304
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 1>The Irish rebellion had been bubbling away in the background the entire time.</v>

305
00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 1>England was in chaos.</v>

306
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Now that the chaos was seeming the Ivr,</v>

307
00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:47.891
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

308
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean natural that England would want its way,</v>

309
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>would province back,</v>

310
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 1>sadly to achieve the same chrome.</v>

311
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Well did some Trudy terrible things.</v>

312
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Cromwell's massacre is a droid and Wexford are still remembered for that</v>

313
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 1>cruelty.</v>

314
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Both involved Cromwells besieging a town then offering new quarter two soldiers</v>

315
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 1>or civilians.</v>

316
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands died.</v>

317
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>While some historians have suggested the scan of suffering was exaggerated.</v>

318
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Those little arguments,</v>

319
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 1>both sieges comes to shooters,</v>

320
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>atrocities still they did ends the Irish rebellion and chrome,</v>

321
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>well returned to England in 1650 just in time to [inaudible] himself in the mess</v>

322
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 1>of the third English civil war that,</v>

323
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:25.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

324
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:26.021
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>

325
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:26.711
<v Speaker 1>his son Charles,</v>

326
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the second reopens his father's packs with a Scotsman who was proclaimed king of</v>

327
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Scotland.</v>

328
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Parliament demanded that Scott's be crushed,</v>

329
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but Thomas Fairfax refused to attack first.</v>

330
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>So chrome well was made commander in chief and he was sending north in September</v>

331
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:43.060
<v Speaker 1>of 1651 he finally defeated the Scots of the battle of Wooster.</v>

332
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 1>And this marks the end of the civil wars in Britain.</v>

333
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So what does a general,</v>

334
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:48.041
<v Speaker 1>he was one,</v>

335
00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>three civil wars and crushed her rebellion.</v>

336
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Do in peacetime?</v>

337
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

338
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:52.920
<v Speaker 1>luckily for Cromwells,</v>

339
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>different sort of war was now brewing in Westminster.</v>

340
00:14:56.181 --> 00:15:01.181
<v Speaker 1>The rump was getting mad with power through 1652 to 1653 at Pasta.</v>

341
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 1>No useful.</v>

342
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 1>That just Alation except to make itself immortal.</v>

343
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 1>The rump has come into being as a stop gap,</v>

344
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 1>a temporary measure until the wars were over into new elections,</v>

345
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>could be called [inaudible].</v>

346
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Now they were voting to end elections permanently.</v>

347
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>By April,</v>

348
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 1>1653 chrome well had had enough in a delicious historic irony.</v>

349
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.850
<v Speaker 1>He sent troops into Westminster echoing Charles,</v>

350
00:15:23.851 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 1>his own breach of parliament 11 years earlier.</v>

351
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>A gunpoint.</v>

352
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.823
<v Speaker 1>He told the rump,</v>

353
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 1>you have sat too long for any good you have been doing lately and the name of</v>

354
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>God go.</v>

355
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.831
<v Speaker 1>There are gone.</v>

356
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Grunwell gave parliament one last shot in July,</v>

357
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 1>1653 he convened a new national assembly,</v>

358
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>popularly known as bad burns parliaments.</v>

359
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:47.141
<v Speaker 1>It's 144 members were hands picks for vest saintliness grunwell expected them to</v>

360
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>rule his new puritan Britain as enlightened men and instead they voted to</v>

361
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.850
<v Speaker 1>dissolve themselves and handle all the power over to Oliver Cromwell.</v>

362
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.383
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Chrome whale is often portrayed as a power hungry tyrants,</v>

364
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but all evidence indicates that he really did try and refuse absolute power.</v>

365
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.251
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

366
00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 1>the peak of the teenagers,</v>

367
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.230
<v Speaker 1>the 15th century tonight sort of Lord protector was revived for his reign under</v>

368
00:16:17.231 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 1>the new constitution was drawn up known as the instrument of government.</v>

369
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's spit power between Cromwells they 15 men council of state and a new</v>

370
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 1>parliaments of 400 elected representatives from England,</v>

371
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Scotland,</v>

372
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Wales and Ireland.</v>

373
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>This was actually kind of progressive.</v>

374
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Never before had Scotland or Ireland had been guaranteed their own MBA's and</v>

375
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:36.461
<v Speaker 1>seats.</v>

376
00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:37.294
<v Speaker 1>So the eds,</v>

377
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 1>they'd got 30 each,</v>

378
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.340
<v Speaker 1>not that this miles progressive.</v>

379
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Ben Stopped to the parliamentary wheels from soon falling off though elections</v>

380
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 1>to the first protector at parliament were held Fredy resulting in a swath of</v>

381
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:52.100
<v Speaker 1>presbytarian and Siyani free thinking and Roya stem piece being returns.</v>

382
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:52.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

383
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>and also some of the members from the rub came back.</v>

384
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly the biggest Cromwell.</v>

385
00:16:56.931 --> 00:16:57.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

386
00:16:57.111 --> 00:17:01.220
<v Speaker 1>fans chroma has hope that the new parliament would pass necessary legislation to</v>

387
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.990
<v Speaker 1>move England's off a war footing,</v>

388
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but instead they set about reducing Cromwells powers when they tried to reduce</v>

389
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 1>the Ami t allows it.</v>

390
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>In January,</v>

391
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.740
<v Speaker 1>1655 Cromwells dissolve parliament.</v>

392
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.370
<v Speaker 1>The new dissolution came as word was leaking out about Cromwells secret 1654</v>

393
00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>deal with Catholic France to ally against Spain.</v>

394
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.301
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

395
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 1>English taxes were being used to finance boneheaded adventuring volume over</v>

396
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:24.870
<v Speaker 1>bearing Monique,</v>

397
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you dissolve parliaments like it was going out of fashion.</v>

398
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 1>The irony was lost out on absolutely no one and many of Cromwell's allies began</v>

399
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 1>to turn against him still.</v>

400
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't broadly unpopular just yet.</v>

401
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy called Penn radic discovered in March of 1655 sure that Cromwells</v>

402
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:41.690
<v Speaker 1>rule was about to collapse.</v>

403
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Penn Roddick organized a royalist uprising intended to put Charles the second on</v>

404
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:46.340
<v Speaker 1>the throne.</v>

405
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.151
<v Speaker 1>He gathered man,</v>

406
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:47.421
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

407
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:51.810
<v Speaker 1>set off across England's rallying locals stores cause only for locals to shut</v>

408
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:52.644
<v Speaker 1>their doors to him.</v>

409
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Panic is men simply ran for their lives.</v>

410
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Penn radix dismal uprising.</v>

411
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It was crushed before I dealt with again.</v>

412
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Penn Roderick's uprising may have been amateur hour,</v>

413
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but it gave chromeo the excuse he needed to scrap the new constitution and set</v>

414
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 1>up a military dictatorship,</v>

415
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>England and Wales,</v>

416
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:14.511
<v Speaker 1>but split into 12 districts each under the control of a desk spotting major</v>

417
00:18:14.641 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

418
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.470
<v Speaker 1>hugely unpopular.</v>

419
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 1>The system lasted barely a year before Cranwell was forced to scrap it and</v>

420
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.340
<v Speaker 1>revive parliaments in September of 1656 only the seconds protector at parliament</v>

421
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 1>wasn't freely elected.</v>

422
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Purged of Cromwells enemies stuffed with toadies finally voted in February of</v>

423
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>1657 to make Cranwell king.</v>

424
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

425
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 1>He was really made king.</v>

426
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 1>The very thing that chrome well had fought so hard to read,</v>

427
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 1>written off to be absolutely fair.</v>

428
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 1>They Britain's entire system of government relied on a king or queens,</v>

429
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 1>give Roya sends ins,</v>

430
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 1>wave things through.</v>

431
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So having one was something of an urgent legal matter.</v>

432
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It does not mean it's chrome world was on an idea king and all,</v>

433
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.973
<v Speaker 1>but name.</v>

434
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 1>He was totally referred to as his highness.</v>

435
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 1>He lived in Charles the first solid palace and was handing out nights do all of</v>

436
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:01.591
<v Speaker 1>his friends.</v>

437
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:02.424
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

438
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what a king does.</v>

439
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Andrian the 26 1657 protector at Britain decided to make it official.</v>

440
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Cromwell was crowns in our lavish ceremony.</v>

441
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 1>That was almost in every respect a coronation.</v>

442
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 1>The only difference was that he kept to the Lord protector title instead of</v>

443
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:17.664
<v Speaker 1>becoming King.</v>

444
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're struggling to see the difference.</v>

445
00:19:20.131 --> 00:19:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

446
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

447
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>so in many of Cromwells old comrades,</v>

448
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.690
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

449
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 1>they were struggling to see the difference between the protector is and the is</v>

450
00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:27.801
<v Speaker 1>of Charles,</v>

451
00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:29.100
<v Speaker 1>his personal rule.</v>

452
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.900
<v Speaker 1>King Oliver was levying taxes.</v>

453
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you fight pointless wars and dissolving parliaments at the drop of a crown?</v>

454
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

455
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 1>And we're not done yet because he totally did it again.</v>

456
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 1>In February,</v>

457
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>1658 the second protector at parliament voted to grow a backbone and readmit MPs</v>

458
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:46.120
<v Speaker 1>excluded by Cromwells man.</v>

459
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.930
<v Speaker 1>So that was it for the second protector parliaments,</v>

460
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the last few months of Cromwells life saw him withdraw from public affairs.</v>

461
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 1>His daughter Elizabeth died of cancer in early 1658 and it seems something in</v>

462
00:19:57.361 --> 00:19:57.561
<v Speaker 1>chrome.</v>

463
00:19:57.561 --> 00:19:57.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

464
00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 1>some vital spark just vanished.</v>

465
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 1>He stopped receiving people or even really ruling.</v>

466
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps he realized what he'd become and was disgusted by it.</v>

467
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.753
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps not.</v>

468
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.790
<v Speaker 1>On September the third 1658 the man who was almost king Oliver passed away that</v>

469
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:13.950
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

470
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 1>A terrific storm.</v>

471
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Racketing vins houses were torn apart and scattered by the winds.</v>

472
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Ships sank beneath the rolling waves.</v>

473
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It was said that the storm was Satan come to take theater door to protect us</v>

474
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>

475
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Although the protector,</v>

476
00:20:26.821 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 1>it would survive another year under Cromwells son Richard did effectively died</v>

477
00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:31.421
<v Speaker 1>with chrome.</v>

478
00:20:31.421 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

479
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Richard would last less than a year before being deposed and replaced with the</v>

480
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>revived rump.</v>

481
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.510
<v Speaker 1>The Rambaud in Zen barely reconvened before an army general known as George</v>

482
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Monka marched on London and ordered the rump to readmit it's excluded members.</v>

483
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Long Parliament was then revived,</v>

484
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.750
<v Speaker 1>just long enough vote for it's own solution.</v>

485
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Then you convention parliament that followed in 1660 immediately voted to</v>

486
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 1>restore Charles the second to the throne,</v>

487
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 1>so the English interregnum ends it.</v>

488
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Charles the second was on the throne with the only new limitations on his powers</v>

489
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.160
<v Speaker 1>being those proposed by the long parliaments back in 1640 everything that</v>

490
00:21:05.161 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 1>happens in the intervening two decades,</v>

491
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the three English civil wars,</v>

492
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the Irish rebellion,</v>

493
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.013
<v Speaker 1>the protectors,</v>

494
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 1>they all became effectively pointless.</v>

495
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Cranwell had raised an army and killed a king,</v>

496
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:15.970
<v Speaker 1>but within two years of his death,</v>

497
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>his achievements that all turned to dust.</v>

498
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.490
<v Speaker 1>On January the 30th 1661 Cromwells body was disinterred 12 years to the day of</v>

499
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:24.101
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>

500
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:27.580
<v Speaker 1>the first sex education alongside the corpses of two other prominent</v>

501
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 1>parliamentarians.</v>

502
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It was symbolically hung at Tibor and gallows before being beheaded.</v>

503
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>As late as 1685 you could still see the former lord protectors head on a spike</v>

504
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>outside Westminster.</v>

505
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It was all the bloodshed for nothing without a doubt.</v>

506
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Cromwells did some terrible things during his long career.</v>

507
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 1>He committed atrocities in Ireland and this personal ambition turned what could</v>

508
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:50.830
<v Speaker 1>have been the world's first liberal revolution into it,</v>

509
00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:51.431
<v Speaker 1>like Ganache,</v>

510
00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>flop.</v>

511
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It would fall to American and French revolutionaries over a century later to</v>

512
00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 1>complete what the English had started.</v>

513
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 1>But Cranwell was also a truly great general,</v>

514
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>a leader of men who could stand shoulder to shoulder with Washington or bolivar</v>

515
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 1>without Cromwells.</v>

516
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 1>You have no parliamentarian victory in the English civil wars without</v>

517
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:10.390
<v Speaker 1>parliaments victory.</v>

518
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 1>None of the ideas that would lead to influence the founding fathers gain any</v>

519
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 1>traction from,</v>

520
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

521
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>he was an ogre,</v>

522
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.751
<v Speaker 1>death spot fool,</v>

523
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 1>and a failure.</v>

524
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 1>He was also the man who kills a tyrant king.</v>

525
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>

526
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I should in our modern world.</v>
