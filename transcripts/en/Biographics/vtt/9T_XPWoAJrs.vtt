00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Long before Kim Jong own became the goto tyrants for five star absurdity.</v>

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>There was another dictator on the block.</v>

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Muammar Gaddafi,</v>

4
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>rude,</v>

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Libya for 42 years with an iron fist,</v>

6
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>wraps in a sequin the glove,</v>

7
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.861
<v Speaker 1>so garish,</v>

8
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>it would put liberace to shame his flamboyant rain.</v>

9
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>It was famous for its absurdity for every headline relating to his terrorist</v>

10
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:24.711
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

11
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>There were maybe a dozen more about his plastic surgery addiction or his old</v>

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>female bodyguard treat.</v>

13
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>By the time Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011,</v>

14
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>he was less fit than he was simply mocked,</v>

15
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but behind the monstrous vanity lay,</v>

16
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>a man who was simply a month staff rape and Gaddafi's Libya.</v>

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It was institutionalized.</v>

18
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Mass executions were broadcast on TV.</v>

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Dissidence were executed,</v>

20
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and their bodies were kept in freezers.</v>

21
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>For these self-styled King of all kings to visit.</v>

22
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.783
<v Speaker 1>It is leisure,</v>

23
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.260
<v Speaker 1>but such depraved behavior.</v>

24
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't created in a vacuum.</v>

25
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>It was only thanks to Libya's tortured history.</v>

26
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>There's good offi was able to imprint his psychosis on his nation.</v>

27
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Today on biographics,</v>

28
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>we're exploring the life of the mad dog of the Middle East.</v>

29
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Most historians of Gaddafi start with the obvious place,</v>

30
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>the sweltering and June day in 1942 when he was born in a nomads,</v>

31
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>tends near the dusty fishing village of Santa Fe.</v>

32
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 1>But to really understand Gaddafi,</v>

33
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to go back further all the way.</v>
