This video is made possible by brilliance.

00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:04.380
You'll learn more about brilliant later in today's video,

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:06.210
but if you'd like to learn more about them right now,

4
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.010
I've got a brilliant.org forward slash.

5
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:11.580
Biographics you'll also find a link in the description below.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.090
<v 0>Socrates is considered the father of western philosophy.</v>

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
He was a man who questioned everything and everyone with no regard for how his

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:30.330
opinions would be received.
He imposed his views with a dogmatic superiority.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.820
This eventually sealed his fate.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.290
It's still his great legacy to the world was the method of questioning to arrive

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.150
at the truth,
which is known as the Socratic method.
Today on biographics,

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.950
we're going to discover the man who was Socrates

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.990
of all the great figures of antiquity.

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.350
None are as frustrating for the historian as Socrates.

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.140
The man never wrote down anything that has survived,

17
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.050
so the only records of his life come from secondary sources.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.480
The two main ones are from Plato,
his devoted students and Xenophon.

19
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.200
They contemporary of Plato.

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
These writings mainly consist of records of conversations that often included

21
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:12.300
Socrates himself.

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.110
Deciding the facts of his life from such writings is a bit of a challenge.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.621
In fact,

24
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.400
this lack of solid biographical information is actually known as the Socratic

25
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.090
problem.

26
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.090
Socrates was either born in 469 or 470 BCE in a Greek village located at 20

27
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.840
minute walk away from Athens.
His father,

28
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.020
[inaudible] was a sculptor while his mother [inaudible] worked as a midwife.

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.380
Software discuss wants it his son to take on the craft of a sculptor.

30
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.080
So during his youth he was apprentice to his father.

31
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.410
He apparently became an accomplished sculptor with tradition having it that he

32
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.670
worked on a well named statue entitled for three muses in their habits which was

33
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.800
displayed at the Acropolis.
As a young man,

34
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:53.140
Socrates devoured the writings of the Greek philosopher and exaggerates.

35
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.130
It is believed that he may have actually studied under this master,

36
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.170
but this cannot be determined with certainty.

37
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.400
The basic teachings all that Xander is that all things have always existed,

38
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.240
puts in their original form were in tiny fragments of that current form in

39
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:06.691
Athens.

40
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:10.530
The [inaudible] Gora or public square was the central meeting place for men who

41
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:14.070
would discuss politics,
art,
and philosophy as even still a youth.

42
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.130
Socrates was not able to attend the or Gora.
Instead,

43
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:20.190
he spent much of his free time in the workshops of the city's merchants where he

44
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:22.500
would engage them in philosophical questioning.

45
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.330
After some time working as a sculptor,

46
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.740
Socrates went off to study under the philosophical master [inaudible].

47
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.470
He studied mathematics and destroy enemy and became familiar with the work of

48
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:32.430
earlier philosophers.

49
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.780
According to a third century biographer by the name of [inaudible] latest Oculus

50
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.810
embarks upon they homosexual relationship with Socrates,

51
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.540
a practice which was widespread in ancient Greece.

52
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.600
At the time that Socrates began showing an interest in philosophy,

53
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.700
the discipline was about a hundred years old.

54
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.450
The idea is the word being thrown around web largely theoretical bearing,

55
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.070
little practical application.

56
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.310
Socrates soon came to the realization the other things that he was learning.

57
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:58.590
They didn't really have any benefit to society.

58
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.100
He was far more interested in addressing the problems of everyday life despite

59
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.880
his curiosity to understand the world.
He was not a scientific thinker.

60
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.940
Rather than questioning the weld,
do understand how it worked.

61
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.810
He believed that we would be better off questioning ourselves in order to

62
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.360
understand how we work.
He adopted the quote,

63
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:20.020
which has often been wrongly attributed to him and that's know thyself.

64
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.640
With the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war in 431 BCE,

65
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.130
Socrates was recruited as a hoplite.

66
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.390
The equivalence of a private third class immediately stood out among his fellow

67
00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:40.290
conscripts even though there is much discrepancy about the details of his life.

68
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320
There is one thing about Socrates upon which there is universal agreement and

69
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:49.200
that's what he was ugly.
He had a snub nose and is how it was long and uncapped.

70
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.520
He also showed no interest in personal grooming and there's also rally bathed.

71
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:57.540
We know about Socrates military service from the writings of Plato in Plato's

72
00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:58.291
work apology,

73
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:01.450
he tells us that his master fought in the battles of amphib Willis deleon.

74
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.390
I'm in Potter Diet and other chronic Alaa.

75
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.020
Alison by artists specifically mentioned Socrates,

76
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.990
heroic actions in the bachelor of deleon stating that the philosopher saved his

77
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:13.490
life during the fighting having completed his military service in foreign during

78
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:16.410
six BCE,
Socrates was appointed as a member of the Bul,

79
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:18.300
which was a 500 member council,

80
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:21.150
which ran the daily affairs of Athens is the uniform,

81
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:24.450
tells us that he was the overseer of a debate that was held to determine the

82
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:28.530
fates of a number of military commanders who abandons their wounded in battle in

83
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:29.940
order to pursue the Spartans.

84
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.820
The public were clamoring for the men's we put to death,
but Socrates,

85
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.490
he blocked the vote and he sped the men's lives

86
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.420
with the ends of the Peloponnesian war in 404 BC,

87
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.200
there was a period of upheaval in Athens that resulted in the coming to power of

88
00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:50.540
a group known as the 30 tyrants.

89
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.440
These men instituted a period of terra marked by bloodshed and confiscation of

90
00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:56.720
property.
After eight months,
the rebel regime,

91
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:59.480
Fallon was replaced with a democratic Greek governments,

92
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:03.590
but that hardly meant that life was going to get better for Socrates.
In fact,

93
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.090
it was mounted to get a whole lot worse.
Socrates was an opponent of democracy.

94
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.380
He believed that the people as a whole and capable of self rule,

95
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680
they needed a wise shepherd to guide them in their lives.

96
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.490
He further claims that the ordinary citizen did not possess any native virtue

97
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.730
that would given them the ability to speak on behalf of others.

98
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.720
Virtue he maintained was something that is attained only by knowledge,

99
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:31.050
and that knowledge was beyond the scope of the everyday person.
These ideas,

100
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:34.760
as they were sharply at odds with those of the Athenian Society in which

101
00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:35.900
Socrates lived,

102
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.310
that people cherish the enlightened right of every citizen having a voice in the

103
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:40.940
assembly.

104
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.940
As a result of the ideas of Socrates were viewed with suspicion if not outright

105
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.054
hostility.

106
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.940
Things weren't helps by the rather condescending and arrogant manner in which

107
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:52.340
she expressed his views.

108
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.820
He was dismissive of those who held views country to his own.

109
00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.620
This frequently lead violent reactions dodge these records is that men set upon

110
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:05.420
him with their fists or tore his hat out paced with this Socrates bull.

111
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:07.580
All this ill usage patiently.

112
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.870
A fascinating contemporary view of Socrates is provided by the Athenian comic

113
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.871
playwright Aristophanes in 423 BC he wrote a play called of the clouds and that

114
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.930
play is a character who is clearly based on Socrates.
This character,

115
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:22.970
the headmaster of a thinkery,

116
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.360
is presented as a comic buffoon who stalks the streets.

117
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.350
Beth was looking down his nose that the ignorant masses and Andrew are rolling

118
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:34.040
his eyes at the unintelligible guttural murmurings that he hears.

119
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.880
Socrates was apparently friendly with Aristophanes and held no grudge against

120
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:39.290
such betrayals.
In fact,

121
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.040
please saw quite to saying the following when they break adjust upon me in the

122
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.450
theater,
I feel as if I were at a big party of good friends.

123
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.860
It beers then that around the four twinsies Socrates was seen by most people as

124
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:55.850
a local audible who was slightly annoying but generally harmless,

125
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.660
but well that view,
it was about of change.
The democracy.

126
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:04.100
The Athenians so cherished,
it was challenged on two occasions during Socrates,

127
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.390
later years during a full month periods in for 11 to four 10 BCE,

128
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.590
Athenian democracy.
It was overthrown.
Then in 404 BCE,

129
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.150
the 30 tyrants,
you subbed to democracy ushering in eight months of chaos.

130
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.570
Both of these insurrections were led by former students of Socrates,

131
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:23.450
Alison [inaudible],
and Critias relatives of Plato.

132
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.350
The first is that these insurrections turns public opinion against Socrates as

133
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:29.870
the brains behind the coup with the bloodshed caused.

134
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:33.770
By the seconds over three people began to indirectly blame the philosopher for

135
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.260
the carnage.
With the coming to power,
the 30 tyrants,

136
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:39.050
the former leaders of the democracy fled to the mountains.

137
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.270
It was that that they plans their resistance.

138
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.410
The elders of the new totalitarian government did not directly involve Socrates

139
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:50.000
in the carrying out of their wicked act.
Six steps on one single occasion.

140
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.860
They summoned him along with four other men and ordered them to go to Salamis

141
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.830
and apprehends,

142
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:59.480
a learned man of influence by the name of Leon and then bring him back to Athens

143
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:00.350
to be executed.

144
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.220
This man was an upstanding on a citizen who had done nothing deserving of

145
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.390
condemnation,
let alone death.
Socrates refuse to do this daddy whack,

146
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.230
stating that he would never perform an act that compromised his integrity.

147
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.590
However,
he didn't do anything to warmly on of the impending danger.

148
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.640
As a result of the other four men went ahead and was apprehended Leon and he was

149
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:22.460
summarily put to death.
This failure to proactively,

150
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.950
warmly on it would come back to home Socrates,

151
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:28.430
that is upcoming trial rather than being viewed as the local eccentric.

152
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:32.540
Socrates was now being seen by many as a dangerous spreader of radical ideas

153
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:37.280
that were leading others to the most vile accesses.
In 403 BCE,

154
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.210
the rule of the 30 tyrants was over and they form a democratic government had

155
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:43.910
been restored,
a general assembly had been enacted,

156
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:47.810
which meant that no one including Socrates could be brought up on charges of

157
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:50.570
their actions during the eight months of tyranny.
Now,

158
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.520
just before we get into the downfall of Socrates,

159
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.410
I do want to briefly talk about today's sponsor.
Brilliant.

160
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.650
I know as always these ads in the middle less than awesome but brilliant,

161
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.580
fantastic for sponsoring this sort of longer content because it allows us to

162
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.010
share these stories of some of the world's greatest historical thinkers,

163
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.000
brilliance or a science learning platform that will allow you to learn through

164
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:09.811
active learning,

165
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.950
which sums up is basically the opposite of that healing and reading a bunch of

166
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.060
complex information about some principal is just having it go completely over

167
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:20.520
your hat and brilliant.
Don't just deal with the basics or they,

168
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.110
they do cover that as well.

169
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:26.400
They go all the way through to very complex things like advanced statistics.

170
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.140
Brilliance have a relatively new feature.

171
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:31.500
It's called daily problems and it's five minutes a day that you can use to

172
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.990
exercise your brain and then something new.

173
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.410
Each problem provides you the context and a framework you need to tackle it.

174
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.920
That means you can learn concepts by applying them.
That's that active learning.

175
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.210
This sort of short daily practice can lead you from curiosity to mastery in far

176
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.060
less time than you might think I've been using.
Brilliant.
It's excellent.

177
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.010
That should go try it out.
It just,

178
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:53.520
even if it's just to see how quickly you can understand those complex subjects,

179
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.240
you can support this show by going to brilliant.org forward slash biographics

180
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.080
and now let's get on with our exploration of Socrates's life.

181
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.420
Socrates was finally arrested in 399 BCA.
By then,

182
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:14.960
the stage is how to four years since the end of the last revolt to come up with

183
00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:17.530
some charges against him.
During that period,
Socrates,

184
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.950
they had to be undeterred by the returns,

185
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:24.530
the favor of democracy and the antipathy towards those who espoused views and

186
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:25.400
opposition to it.

187
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.870
He continued to deride democracy and champion rule by a strong leader when there

188
00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:33.530
was another attempt to overthrow in 401 the state that had enough of is

189
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:35.960
revolutionizing of the impressionable youth.

190
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.460
It was now just a matter of time before he was brought to account the Athenian

191
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:44.060
law allowed for any citizens to bring criminal proceedings against another man.

192
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.810
Imagine names Mellitus brought an oral summons against Socrates.

193
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.130
The summons required him to appear before a legal magistrates faced charges of

194
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:54.080
impiety and corrupting the youth.

195
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.980
The magistrate heard out the applicants and determines that the were grounds for

196
00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:59.810
a preliminary hearing.
At that hearing,

197
00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:03.200
the charges were read out and Socrates was given the opportunity to answer them.

198
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.130
Uh,
documents containing the challenges was drawn up along with the requested

199
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:08.240
penalty.
It reds.

200
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.010
Socrates is guilty of refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state and

201
00:11:13.011 --> 00:11:17.540
to introducing new divinities.
He has also guilty of corrupting the youth.

202
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.820
The penalty demanded his death.

203
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.050
The actual trial took place over a period of nine hours in the [inaudible] Gora

204
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:28.680
in the center of Athens.
The Jerry was made up of 500 citizens drawn by lot.

205
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.750
The large number was standard in ancient trials seem to have been mainly to

206
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:36.620
prevent bribery from swaying the outcome of cases after the reading over the

207
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:37.101
challenges,

208
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:41.060
the three main accuses of Socrates were given three hours to present a case.

209
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.640
There is no surviving record of their testimony,

210
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:46.940
but we do know that the main accuser was not Mellitus,

211
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:51.320
but a certain Anitas Itas who was also a politician who harbored ongoing

212
00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:52.970
resentments against Socrates.

213
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.110
It is believed that the sign of an Itas was a student with him,

214
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.480
Socrates that had a homosexual relationship,

215
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.910
something which greatly upset the father.

216
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.420
It is likely that the main thrust of the accusations was that Socrates was

217
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:08.650
leading young people down a dangerous political path with his anti democratic

218
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:09.670
teachings.
How are the,

219
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.510
in Plato's apology in which he provides an accounts of Socrates as defense,

220
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:17.080
considerable weight has given to his defense of the charge of impiety.

221
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.380
Piety in those days involve not only respect for the Greek gods,

222
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:23.260
but also for the dead and for one's ancestors.

223
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.200
If there was even one in pious person in the city,

224
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:29.650
it was a serious matter is that one's incursions might bring the wrath of the

225
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:31.300
gods upon the entire city.

226
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.860
Even though the Athenians have no written scripture or code and no priesthood,

227
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.920
there was a significant number of rituals,
observances,

228
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.050
and offerings that were required.

229
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.040
It is highly likely that Socrates neglected to observe the rituals of the gods

230
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.230
that would have been expected of him.
Furthermore,

231
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:50.500
he would have argued that the generally accepted view of worship as being based

232
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:53.200
on rituals was wrong.
According to Zena Font,

233
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.470
Socrates had the ability to communicate directly with the gods.

234
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.730
This would have been infuriated.

235
00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:01.120
Those in attendance that is trialing polluting the 500 jurors.

236
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.380
It is difficult for us to know just what if any religious beliefs Socrates

237
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:07.300
actually held throughout his dialogues.

238
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:11.530
Plato has him referring to both at one gods and also to plural gods.

239
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.130
It has also been suggested that he viewed the word God is referring to the

240
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:19.600
philosophical idea of goodness,
a critical parts of the accusations against him,

241
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:23.440
how to do with his place association with the leaders of the 30 tyrants

242
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:24.100
rebellions,

243
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.030
specifically his ties to the leader of the revolt Critias and his defense.

244
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.120
Socrates brought up the time when he was ordered to go into rascally and of

245
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.850
Salamis.
He claims that his refusal to do so.

246
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:37.660
It was a clear indication that he was not in cahoots with the rebels and was

247
00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:39.940
indeed a loyal citizen of Athens.

248
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.050
His accused accounted that a loyal citizen would have done more than simply

249
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.760
refrain from the bad action.

250
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.690
He would have warned in the innocent man and is therefore saved his life.

251
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.590
So critiques spoken his own defense for three full hours of the dozens of

252
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:57.130
versions of it that were made only to have survive down to our time.

253
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.290
Those of Plato and Xenophon diversions agree that the master was defined in his

254
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:06.760
tone almost as if he were inviting and adverse judgments as positive as defense.

255
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.250
Socrates told the jurors that he was a hero.

256
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.950
He recalls his exemplary military service.

257
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.440
He then extended the thought with an analogy,

258
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:18.430
telling them that he had fought for decades to save the souls of Young
Athenians.

259
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.890
If teaching virtue made him guilty of corruption,

260
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.190
he said then that he was guilty as charged.

261
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.820
He then assured his lesson as with the following men of Athens,

262
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.570
I honor and love you,
but I shall obey God rather than you.

263
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.670
And when I have life and strength,

264
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.380
I shall never cease from the practice and teaching a philosophy in the face of

265
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.720
the challenges that he was a corruption of the youth of Athens.

266
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.360
Socrates stated that he never claimed to be a teacher.

267
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.410
He was merely a man who happened to spend time strolling around the city.

268
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.220
If he was asked a question,
he would answer it to the best of his ability.

269
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.530
Then pointing to place her and others of his followers in the crowd.

270
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.650
He pointed out that none of them had have a lead and accusation against him.

271
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.780
Those of his former students who had done that,

272
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:04.100
he said did so because they corrupted the things that he had set as the marathon

273
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:08.120
speech drew to a close.
It was obvious to everyone listening that Socrates said,

274
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.140
no intention of stopping doing whatever it was that the people objected to.

275
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.390
The only way to stop him,
we still put him to death.

276
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.130
Contrary to normal practice in such proceedings,
he made no please for any mercy.

277
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.780
After nine hours of proceedings,

278
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:24.470
the jury of 500 were tasked with making that decision.
Unlike today,

279
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.630
the jury did not retire to discuss their thoughts.

280
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:31.631
They simply voted by placing a disk and one of two Ns labeled guilty or not

281
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:35.480
guilty with the urn that held the most votes determining the outcome when

282
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:36.620
they've completed this task.

283
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:41.060
There were 280 desks in the guilty on and 220 in the not guilty one,

284
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.570
but the jury's job.
It was not yet over.
They had to determine the penalty.

285
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.620
The accusers of Socrates rose and put forward their case that the condemned

286
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:51.800
impious corruptor of the youth of Athens must be put to death.

287
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.220
Socrates himself was then invited to put forward a case for leniency.

288
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.070
This was his opportunity to win some favor with the jury,

289
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.390
perhaps by suggesting that he'd be sent into exile.
Boss treat who isn't him.

290
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.710
He refused to step down from his position of superior indignation.
He should.

291
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.490
He suggested to be rewarded rather than condemned for his actions.

292
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.361
The court officials,

293
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:15.260
they were not impressed and he was told to give a more realistic alternative

294
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:15.890
penalty.

295
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.910
Socrates then offered that he could be subjected to a modest fine faced with

296
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.510
these two extremes of punishments.
The jurors,
they chose death

297
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.070
with the trial.
Now I have a Socrates was taken to an adjoining prison cell.

298
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.430
According to the records of his final days,
pen the by Plato.

299
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.570
Socrates was given the opportunity to escape when he was visited in a cell by

300
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:41.740
his wealthy friend Creattech.

301
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.760
This man has already laid plans to smuggle Socrates out of Athens.
However,

302
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:49.150
the condemned man showed no interest in escaping his fate.

303
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.200
The conversation between the two men as Credo attempted to persuade Socrates to

304
00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:57.700
escape and the great philosophers responses presents an important aspect of

305
00:16:57.701 --> 00:16:59.230
Socrates as moral code.

306
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.970
Criso put forward three points as to why Socrates should escape from his death

307
00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:04.660
sentence.

308
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.200
First lead the death would be a bad reflection on the followers of Socrates's.

309
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.020
People would think that they'd abandoned him.
Secondly,

310
00:17:11.021 --> 00:17:14.260
or finances involved in the escape were covered and furthermore,

311
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:17.020
a comfortable life in exile had been arranged.
Finally,

312
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:20.290
his death would leave his sons without a father.
In response.

313
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:23.140
Socrates countered the demand should not worry about public opinion,

314
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:24.970
but only be guided by wisdom.

315
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.810
The only real question to consider in the situation was whether or not it was

316
00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:32.080
just for Socrates.
Do escape his condemnation to death.

317
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.800
He then spoke of the laws of Athens stating this to break one of those laws

318
00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:39.490
meant breaking them all to go against the laws of Athens would be like a child

319
00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.660
rebelling against a parents.

320
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.780
He argued if he dad to go against the laws of the city here started,

321
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.470
he would receive a harsh and judgments in the underworld.
As a result,

322
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.360
Socrates refused the offer,
escape his face.
It was now sealed,

323
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.180
plays a chronicled his death and his walk dome and it's,

324
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:57.300
he gives an eye witness accounts from the viewpoint of the fictional character,

325
00:17:57.301 --> 00:17:59.040
a fito.
According to the accounts,

326
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:01.920
a man came into the cell carrying a cup of poison hemlock.

327
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.940
Socrates turns to him and said,
now,
good sa,
you understand these things.

328
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.960
Tell me what I must do.
The man replied,
just drink it since.

329
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:13.830
Walk around until your legs begin to feel heavy.
Then lie down.

330
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.950
It will soon act.
The Cup was then offered to Socrates.

331
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.940
You took it happily and asked if it was permissible for him to offer a pledge

332
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:24.780
before drinking as permission was granted and z offered the following prayer,

333
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.400
we can and must praise the gods of the tall so Joan on earth will continue happy

334
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.240
beyond the grave.

335
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.470
This is my prayer and it's May it come to pass at this,

336
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:36.570
he drank the poison without hesitation,

337
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.820
those of his friends who were in the cell with him,

338
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:43.380
gateway to tears prompting Socrates to declare you are strange fellows.

339
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.010
What is wrong with you?
I send the women away for this very purpose to stop.

340
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:51.030
They're creating such a scene.
I have herbs that one should die in silence,

341
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.530
so please keep quiet and to keep control of yourselves for the next few minutes

342
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:58.230
he walked around the room.
Then when his legs became heavy,

343
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:02.250
he laid down on his badge with a covering over his face solely.

344
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.370
He lost feeling first and his legs then moving up his body.

345
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.580
His last words directed credo a credo.

346
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.750
We owe a cock to Asclepius do pay it.
Don't forget,

347
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.730
this seems around the strange request,

348
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:18.270
but it makes sense when we realized that Asclepius was the god of good health,

349
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.410
the sacrifice of a caucus and normal offering for thanks for recovery from

350
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:22.920
illness.

351
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.920
Socrates believed that he was cured of the disease of life and was as a result,

352
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.990
not frightened of death creature than ostium.

353
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.530
If there was anything else you wanted to say,
but there was no reply.

354
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.090
The poison had reached his hot and was the life of Socrates was drained away.

355
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:43.980
Plato continued his accounts with these words.
This was the end of our friends,

356
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.080
the best,
wisest,
and most upright man of any that I have ever known.

357
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.780
