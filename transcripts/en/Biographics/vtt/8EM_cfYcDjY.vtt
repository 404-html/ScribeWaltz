00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.100
Just before we get started with today's video,

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:05.730
I want to thank brilliant for sponsoring us to support bar graphics and learn

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.990
more about brilliant.
Got a brilliant.org/biographics and sign up for free.

4
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.110
<v 0>Of the early philosophers who followed in the footsteps of Socrates,</v>

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.430
no one was as striking as eccentric as dialed Ginny's.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.950
He was the original Stoic,
a man who rid himself of the trappings of society,

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.220
living in an oversized wine casket's and championing the lifestyle of dogs or

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.670
humans.
He also challenged all of the norms of society,

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.810
shocking people with his outrageous actions and does cutting wet.

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.130
In today's biographics,

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.840
we take a closer look at the bizarre life of [inaudible] is the cynic.

13
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.030
The life of [inaudible] is woven in legend and myth guessing to the facts of his

14
00:00:57.041 --> 00:01:00.340
life is difficult and there is much that is not.
No.

15
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.130
We do know that he was born in the Greek city of sin.

16
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.550
No p between four 12 and four oh three BCE.

17
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.330
He was the son of a prominent civil sevens by the name of his sisters.

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.880
He was the master of the town's mint.

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.180
This position would have provided the family with the highest standard of living

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.180
than most people and this,

21
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:21.220
this is what we really know about dialed Ginny's his early years.

22
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.340
Ancient biographers tell us that his fascination with philosophy,

23
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:26.950
it began with a scandal involving his home city.

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.480
So ebay was a busy seaport situated in the southern coast of the Black Sea.

25
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.850
It was a crossroads between Crimea to the North End,

26
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.590
upper Mesopotamia to the south.

27
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.370
Many of the people who lived in survey had been resettled from Athens.

28
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.970
As a result of the city was a regional center of Greek culture.

29
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.080
The coordinator of [inaudible] Bay was the preferred currency for regional
trait.

30
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.470
At some points in accusation was made that the master of the men to ccs had been

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.860
tampering with the coinage.
Want accounts that have you abilities,

32
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:57.370
claims that it was actually dialed Janiece himself who was working at the men

33
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:01.540
since it was the key who damaged the coinage.
Either way,
both father and son,

34
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.920
they were forced to flee.
The city.

35
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.320
One account tells us that they were eventually caught,

36
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.220
convicted and sent to prison with hi.
Sissy has dying in his cell wall.

37
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.870
Dioxygenase is managed to escape.

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.840
Donald's needs now found himself driven from his hometown.
He had lost his home.

39
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.720
His possessions is livelihoods and just citizenship.

40
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.680
Sub Accounts claimed that he traveled to Delfi near Mount Parnassus and upper

41
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.980
central Greece.
It was there that the seat of Pythia was located.

42
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.720
This was the home of the Oracle,

43
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:35.590
the priestess of the sanctuary dedicated to Apollo.

44
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.050
The oracle was renowned as being a source of wisdom and prophecy.

45
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.340
Dungeon is is said to have consulted the oracle to inquire on the how to restore

46
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.220
his mismatched reputation.
She replied,
deface the currency dodger needs.

47
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.860
Apparently it took the advice figuratively rather than literally having been

48
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:54.710
wrongly accused of defacing the physical currency of his home city.

49
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.650
He would now to face the currency of society.

50
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.170
He would do this by finding way to take account of moral values out of society.

51
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.340
A biography written by dialed Ginny's if [inaudible] no relation status.

52
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.640
He really two faced the currency giving to matters of convention,

53
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.250
nothing of the weight that he grunted to matters that accord with nature into

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.060
setting that the manner of life he lived was the same as that of Herrick Lee's

55
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.460
when he preferred freedom to everything.

56
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.533
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.060
<v 0>Doctor,
he's an ex travel to Athens in Cetra feather enlightenment.</v>

58
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.050
He resolved to take his adverse situation and convert it into a virtue.

59
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.650
He began to ascend his pride and being without a state,

60
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.990
a home or any material possessions.

61
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.560
He referred to himself as a cosmopolitan or a citizen of the world.

62
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.920
He's been time in Athens where he sought guidance from a famous or rate or by

63
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:50.590
the name of gorgeous.
At this time,
it wasn't growing.

64
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:53.210
Number of followers of Socrates in Athens don't.

65
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.480
Ginny's came into contact with some of his followers.

66
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.020
He chose to become a disciple of anticipate knees who was one of the most

67
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:02.590
committed of Socrates's students to living a life of radical freedom.

68
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.890
According to antice,
the knees.
Veggie was expressed in actions,

69
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.730
not in thoughts or discourse.
He saw this all value in teaching,

70
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.710
much referring to converse with himself dodger needs.

71
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.060
It became like a shadow to antice the knees after some time.

72
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.570
The boss to became annoyed is constant close proximity.

73
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.560
He lifted his staff in order to warn down knees off and at this dodge and he

74
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.370
says,
strike the you will find.
No,
it's hard enough to keep me away from you.

75
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.800
So as long as I think you have something to say,

76
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.800
dage needs copied antice the knees,
his style and manner.

77
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.000
He developed a similar cutting humor and extreme practices.
On one occasion,

78
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.840
dioxygenase was trying to sleep in a corner of a room when he was disturbed by

79
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.280
Athenians who are involved in revelries and pottying first century Greek writer

80
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.060
Plutarch's related that he fell into some very disturbing and disheartening

81
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:49.900
reflections.

82
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.770
He mentally compacts the efforts he was making to live a simple life with the

83
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.150
licentious living of the people of the city.
To talk goes on a moment later.

84
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:58.660
However,

85
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.890
a mouse it is said crop top and busy to itself with the crumbs of his bread,

86
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.850
whereupon he wants more recovered his spirits and said to himself as the

87
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:10.400
rebuking himself,
the cowardice,
what you sang,
diabetes,

88
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.300
your leavings make a feast for this creature.

89
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.430
But as for you a man of birth and breeding just because you cannot be getting

90
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.700
drunk over there reclining on soft and flowery couches.

91
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.590
Do you bill whale and the mentee or lot dudgeon these concluded that if a mouse

92
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:30.880
can be satisfied with a few crumbs,
why couldn't he be happy with little means?

93
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.721
This incidence,

94
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.320
it prompted dialogue needs to take as a static way of life to a new level.

95
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.730
He remained single by choice and traveled very likely with just a knapsack and

96
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:41.950
to folded cloak that he used as a bet.

97
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.670
He had no home traveling from city to city.
He would often sneak out doors,

98
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:49.870
but when he was in Carinthia was said to have made a home out of a clay wine jar

99
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.460
that was as big as a bathtub.

100
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.330
They would test his mental fortitude to buy rolling in sand and summer and

101
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.930
hugging statues covered in snow extended periods of time during winter soldier

102
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.470
needs.
He was constantly seeking ways to make his life even more simple.

103
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.800
At one point,
he saw a young boy drinking water from his hands.

104
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.320
He then took his cup from his nap sack and broke,

105
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:14.300
yet explaining vol that I am at who have been carrying superfluids baggage all

106
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.450
this time.
He made no attempts to agreement myself.
In fact,
he's a,

107
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.230
Barron's was so on campus.
People often referred to him as the dog.

108
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.870
One asked why people refer to him that way.
He said,

109
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.160
I phoned on those who give me anything.
I yell,
but to those who refuse,

110
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.860
and I set my teeth in rascals.

111
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.340
There are many accounts that refer to the dog like behavior of dial Janiece.

112
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.060
He personally praise the nature of dogs and so probably it felt that the

113
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.030
references to him being dog,

114
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:43.820
like which were intended as insults well actually complements.

115
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.440
He counseled others to look to the dog as a model of how to live a natural and

116
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.480
unaffected life.
Dogs.
He pointed out,

117
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:52.880
perform their natural bodily functions in public.

118
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.730
They eat anything offered to them and they sleep anywhere.

119
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.750
They also live off instinct having their anxieties about the future and not

120
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:02.900
weighed down by materialism or philosophy.

121
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.450
It is unknown how many written works were produced by Dow journeys.

122
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.290
They range from none at all to 13 none of them have survived,

123
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:19.560
so we have to rely on what others recorded about his writings.

124
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.010
According to first century writer for the Domus dial journeys at rates and very

125
00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:24.240
controversial things,

126
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.540
these included that there is nothing in existence that is naturally good.

127
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.440
He also apparently gave defenses for such things as cannibalism,
incest,

128
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.810
sexual promiscuity,
and murder.

129
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.500
Villa Dharma's claims the contents of Dilijan.
He's his body of work.

130
00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:41.370
We're so scandalous that later still eggs deliberately suppressed them in order

131
00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:42.830
to clean up his image.
Dot.

132
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.200
Denese different from philosophers like Socrates and Plato in that he did not

133
00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:49.410
seek out others to engage in intellectual discussions with,

134
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.820
nor did he attempt to start up a philosophical school or pass on his teachings

135
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:56.040
to others.
In contrast to Socrates and Plato.

136
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.300
He also showed absolutely no interest in politics or civil matters.

137
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.530
He was the ultimate loner who much preferred his own company to the company of

138
00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:05.220
other people.

139
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.880
The one exception to his tendency to isolation was when he would travel to the

140
00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:13.380
great athletic contests of the time he joined the crowds of the Olympian

141
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.560
Isthmian and pithy and games that these events see would spend more time

142
00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:18.450
watching the crowds than the athletes.

143
00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:21.570
As he studied what brings man pleasure and excitement.

144
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.020
His appearance and his strange habits would inevitably draw a crowd,

145
00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:29.670
which he would play up too with some outrageous comments or outrageous acts.

146
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.830
He would then tell people this.

147
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.640
Everyone who followed his example would be relieved of folly,
wickedness,

148
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.240
and intemperance dodging leasing to revel in the founding of conventional

149
00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:40.350
societal norms.

150
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.010
He believe that anything done in private should also be done in public.

151
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.520
As a result,
he would regularly masturbate and urinate in public.

152
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.930
Once that the SBN Games,

153
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:52.020
he was talking to a crowd of people about the struggle to resist temptation.

154
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.280
When he had finished speaking,

155
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:57.210
he squatted on the grounds and proceeded to desiccate the disgusted crowds.

156
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:00.240
They turned away calling him a crazy man.
On another occasion,

157
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.750
people began throwing that boons to him as if he was a dog.
In response,

158
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:06.060
he began to urinate over the bones.

159
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.750
At times he appeared to go out of his way to insult people for no apparent

160
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:10.170
reason.

161
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.100
There is an instance recorded of one of his admirers inviting him into a mansion

162
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.110
and asking him not to spit in the house and respond to standard.

163
00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:20.550
He's projected a mouthful of phlegm into the man's face.

164
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.790
So in a moment we're going to get into our points of dungeon is his life when

165
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.280
he's captured by pirates.
But before we get there,

166
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.680
let me tell you a little bit about today's sponsor brilliance.

167
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.800
Now you've heard me talk about brilliant before that a learning platform that

168
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:33.570
focuses on active learning.

169
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.690
This is where you're given a short bit of information on the scientific concepts

170
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:39.990
and then you're asked to solve a problem based on that information.

171
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.380
It's a really effective way to learn a few months ago,
brilliant Lord,

172
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:45.570
or something new called daily problems.

173
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:49.170
These are five minutes a day that you can use to exercise your brain and learn

174
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:51.900
something new.
Thousands of people doing these daily problems.

175
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:54.330
They've already learned how to use computer science.

176
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.850
Dude effectively bake cheese biscuits.

177
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.400
They've also calculated the area of a snowflake and there's a whole lot more.

178
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.010
Each problem provides you the context and framework that you need to tackle it.

179
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:09.030
That means you can learn concepts by applying them.
That's that active learning.

180
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.560
This sort of short daily practice can lead you from curiosity to mastery in far

181
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:14.820
less time than you would think.

182
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:18.480
So just go to brilliant.org forward slash biographics and finish your day a

183
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.670
little smarter.
The first 200 of you to do so,

184
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.110
we'll get 20% off the annual subscription and you can view all of those previous

185
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:29.520
problems from the archives and let's get into that time that dial Ginny's had a

186
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:31.410
run in with some pirates

187
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.880
during the voyage.
Two agonists,
Donald Ginny's was captured by pirates.

188
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.990
First Century writer.

189
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:45.140
Find out of Alexandria gives us an account of how his stoicism,

190
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.490
Sean through during this ordeal when he was taken prisoner runs,

191
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.150
when they fed him very sparingly and scarcely gave him even necessary food,

192
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.420
he was not weighed down by the second stance is which surrounds it.
Him.

193
00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.470
I did not fair that in humanity of the masters into whose power he had fallen

194
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.480
but sad that it was a most absurd thing for pigs or sheep when they are going to

195
00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:10.100
be sold to be carefully provided with abundant food so as to be rendered fat and

196
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.390
it's flashy but for the most excellent of all animals man to be reduced to a

197
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:14.991
skeleton,

198
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:19.700
buy bad food and it's continual scarcity and so to be rendered of less value

199
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.563
than before.

200
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.710
And then when he had obtained sufficient food and when he was announced to be

201
00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:26.270
sold with the rest of the captives,

202
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.470
he sat down first and breakfast it with great cheerfulness and courage,

203
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.500
giving some of his breakfast to his neighbors and seeing one of them,

204
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:37.760
not merely a sorrowful,
but in a state of extreme despondency.
He said,

205
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.390
will you not give up being miserable?
Take what do you can get?

206
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.090
The pirates put dialed in is up for sale as a slave auction.

207
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.080
When the auctioneer asked him what he was good for,
he replied ruling over men.

208
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.830
He then went on to let loose with one of his sarcastic discourses turning the

209
00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:52.760
auction on his hat.

210
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.580
He was then purchased by a Corinthian by the name of exonerees cause any of

211
00:11:56.581 --> 00:11:58.480
these gave Donald or needs the job of tutoring.

212
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:01.860
His two sons Donald and he spent the rest of his life in Corinth.

213
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.450
He was released as a slave.
After some time.

214
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.170
It has been recorded that when Alexander the Great Pass through on his journey

215
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:11.350
of conquest over the Persian wells,
he sought out [inaudible].

216
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.820
Alexander expected to be matched with the usual adulation that he was accustomed

217
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:16.780
to having heaped upon him.

218
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.760
He came across the dialogue and he is lying in the sun.

219
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.870
Alexander approached him and told him that he would like to grant any wish the

220
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.070
technology needs desired.

221
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.730
This was intended to be an act of respect towards day journey as well.

222
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.010
Also reflecting Alexander's great power in response.
However,

223
00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:34.330
the dodger and he is simply asked that Alexandre move out of the sunlight.

224
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.410
Alexander was initially taken aback by what could have been perceived as a lack

225
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:40.820
of respect,
but as he walked away from the philosophy,

226
00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:44.830
he said that if he wasn't Alexander,
he would wish to be die on journeys.

227
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.380
There are accounts of further interaction between the two men.

228
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.760
According to Arab tradition,

229
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:52.150
Alexandra One's visited dial Ginny's in Corinth and found him sleeping.

230
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.780
Alexandre kicked to waken.
Amens then said,
get up.

231
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.640
I have just conquered your city.

232
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.570
There's [inaudible] is said to have responded and conquering cities is not to be

233
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:05.980
held against kings,
but kicking is how donkeys act on.
He has another occasion.

234
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:10.240
Alexandre is said to have sent a messenger to dial Janiece do invite him to see

235
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:12.550
the king,
the so they refuse the offering.

236
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:14.590
Instructing the messenger to say to Alexander,

237
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.140
that's which prevents you from coming to us,

238
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.050
is that which prevents us from coming to you.

239
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.560
The messenger was apprehensive and told Dale Ginny's what he expected the king

240
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:28.100
to say,
which was so what prevents me and what prevents you to this dog?

241
00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:28.934
And he's replied,

242
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:34.230
you are too powerful to need me and I am too self sufficient to need you.

243
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:40.830
Donald,

244
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.150
when he is believed that the truest level of freedom was to develop a perfect

245
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:45.720
mastery over one's self,

246
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.130
this self sovereignty was what he sought to achieve in every area of his life.

247
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.470
First Century stoic philosopher,
Epictetus,

248
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.490
sometimes [inaudible] beliefs as follows and all that pertains to yourself.

249
00:13:56.491 --> 00:14:00.840
You must change completely from your present practices and must cease to blame

250
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.560
God or man,
you must utterly wipe out.
Desire wins,
Miss,

251
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:08.850
turn your aversion toward the things which lie within the province of the moral

252
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:12.990
purpose and these only you must feel no anger,

253
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.870
no rage,
no envy,
no pity.

254
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.800
In addition to exercising and extraordinary level of self control and self

255
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:22.020
sufficiency,
the Algebra is also displayed.

256
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.370
Fearlessness in his speech is seen by his interactions without exondys.

257
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.920
Plato was a contemporary of [inaudible] is the two men were polar opposites.

258
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:37.840
On the philosophical spectrum to Elgin,

259
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.470
he's considered Plato's lectures and writings to be a complete waste of time.

260
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.030
He made fun of Plato's dialectic teaching and his methods by which is students

261
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:48.280
have to learn key terms.
On one occasion,

262
00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:51.920
Plato was delivering a lecture in which he defines man as an animal who was a

263
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:55.850
bypass and featherless two there's notion dodge and he's walked into the lecture

264
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.970
theater holding a chicken which had been plucked and announced.

265
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.330
Here is Plato's man.
On another occasion,

266
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:06.770
Plato was lecturing about his theory of forms.
He spoke of Table Hood and Capote.

267
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.870
Dodgy knees then replied table and cop high.
See,

268
00:15:09.871 --> 00:15:12.050
but you all table hood and Cupboard Plato.

269
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.220
I seen nowhere plays a attempted to ridiculed Algebra is a simple lifestyle.

270
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:20.600
Once when he saw him washing lettuces,
he says,
how'd you bade caught to Dionysus?

271
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.440
The reader of Syracuse?
You wouldn't now be washing lettuces to,

272
00:15:24.441 --> 00:15:27.140
there's no algae needs replied.
If you had washed lettuces,

273
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:30.650
you wouldn't have paid court to nine isis with his weird style.

274
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:33.170
Ginny's was him making an important distinction.

275
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.570
He was the true uncorrupted philosopher.

276
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.570
Plato had curried favor with the rich and powerful Lens,

277
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.370
then corrupted in the process.

278
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.300
They become enamored with his own fame and intellect.

279
00:15:43.301 --> 00:15:47.720
Since in the process had become a hypocrite to the teachings of Socrates Voy,

280
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.590
his father's Plato View Diageo Genese as a version of Socrates gone crazy.

281
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:52.791
In fact,

282
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:55.820
Donald Ginny's very much resembles the character the Plato created in his

283
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:58.880
dialogue about the stoic masters.
Gorgeous.
In this work,

284
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:02.420
the character [inaudible] states that all things should be done according to

285
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:04.880
nature,
regardless of how shameful they might be.

286
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.060
Plato refers to categories as an a moralist whose actions are curved and nods

287
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:12.500
buying dialectical arguments,
which he considers to be wasted effort,

288
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.180
but by a sense of shame.
There is never any evidence though the dialogue needs.

289
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.550
His actions were ever stemmed by a sense of shame.
However,

290
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:23.660
there are recorded accounts where he used Cim to encourage others to consider

291
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.920
that own actions.
Once when he saw a young man acting,
if femininely he asked,

292
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.690
are you not ashamed that your own intention about yourself should be was the

293
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:37.430
natures for nature made you a man that you are forcing yourself to play the

294
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:38.120
woman?

295
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.440
Yet this admonition seems to stand in contrast to his own lack of restraint with

296
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.790
regards to such things as masturbating and defecating in public and condoning

297
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.870
incest and kind of Elysium despite has repugnant acts and ideas.

298
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:54.890
Die Needs became an object of veneration and current than Athens on one occasion

299
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:58.040
of by accident and he broke off.
Part of dodge needs is clay top.

300
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.230
The people of the city,
they were enraged.

301
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.860
They had the boy flogged and they purchased a new tub that I alderney's.

302
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.540
Unlike Socrates or Plato,

303
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:09.860
he was never seen as a threat by the people of the State rather than many viewed

304
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:12.530
him as a curiosity,
even a harmless clowns.

305
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.590
They were proud to have such an attraction in that midst.

306
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.760
There are conflicting accounts since to the death of Donald's knees.
Yet.

307
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.200
They all agree that he lived to a ripe old age of around 90 years according to

308
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:31.870
some sources,
he held his breath until the next spot.

309
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.470
And another accounts he has said to have died after eating a raw,

310
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:38.230
raw octopus or twist on the ultimate story is that he was busy and while trying

311
00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:43.231
to divide an octopus among dogs in Corinth and Athens statues were erected in

312
00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:47.020
his memory.
The statue was also raised in his hometown of Suno pay.

313
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.580
It's inscription at reds,
even bronze grows old with time,

314
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.760
but your fame [inaudible] not all of eternity shall take away for you alone,

315
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.840
did point out to mortals the lessons of self sufficiency and the path for the
