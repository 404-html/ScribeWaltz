<v Speaker 1>painfully shy young man,</v>

10
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>yet he was transformed by injustice,</v>

11
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>to step beyond his insecurities to become the 20th century's most influential</v>

<v Speaker 1>He lived in a three story house and it's seven the Honduras was known by all</v>

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>He was especially devoted to his mother who he considered to be a saint.</v>

38
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Her piety made a deep impression upon him.</v>

39
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>When the boy was five his father was appointed the chief minister of the smaller</v>

<v Speaker 1>The family that you joined him,</v>

42
00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>that one was a painfully shy Charles.</v>

00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>He kept to himself at school when it's Besson's with Don,</v>

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>he would run home in order to avoid having to talk to any of his peers.</v>

45
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 1>He was also a fearful child who was terrified of many things,</v>

46
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but especially the dark.</v>

47
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>He found his solace in books which were if something,</v>

48
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>if a constant companion when he was just seven years of age and this was the</v>

49
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:09.511
<v Speaker 1>Hindu costume.</v>

50
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:14.511
<v Speaker 1>Mohan became engaged to Casta muck Hangi [inaudible] who was a few months older</v>

51
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 1>than him.</v>

52
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>The arranged marriage was completed when Mohan turned 13 the planning for the</v>

53
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>lavish wedding ceremony and adjustment to married life meant that he had to take</v>

54
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>a year off from his schooling.</v>

55
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>He was an average student at best,</v>

56
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>though he tried hard to please as teachers,</v>

57
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you have no interest in sports games or social activities with any of his peers.</v>

58
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 1>He did,</v>

59
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.240
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

60
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 1>make one friends around this time.</v>

61
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't Muslim boy by the name of shake Mahtab Jake was old Zuarin's more</v>

62
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>street smart than Mohammed.</v>

63
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It was also physically larger and stronger than him.</v>

64
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Speaker 1>He tried in Mohan about his frail condition and it's holding this.</v>

65
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.160
<v Speaker 1>If he ate meat,</v>

66
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>he would get to much bigger and stronger.</v>

67
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

68
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>this was strictly against the Hindu belief,</v>

69
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>

70
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Mohan met his friend in secret one day and he had his first taste of meat even</v>

71
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>though they caused him to vomit he to eat it for the next year without letting</v>

72
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>anyone else know.</v>

73
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>During that period shakes hook into a brothel and experience,</v>

74
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>which was an embarrassing disaster for the impressionable team.</v>

75
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Realizing that shake was a bit of a bad influence.</v>

76
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>He caught off association with him and returns to a strict vegetarian diet.</v>

77
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Bowen's father calm John's died when the boy was 16 years old.</v>

78
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.410
<v Speaker 1>The grief was compounded when Bon and Costa was first child died less than a</v>

79
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>week old.</v>

80
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The couple would go on to have four more children with the first being born in</v>

81
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>1880 8 million completed college at the age of 18 and enrolled in some Aldous</v>

82
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

83
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

84
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>he disliked the lecture style of teaching and dropped out after only a few</v>

85
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

86
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>He had set his sights on becoming a lawyer and eventually becoming a Duwan like</v>

87
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:43.530
<v Speaker 1>his father.</v>

88
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>A family friends suggested that he should go to England to study where it was</v>

89
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>easier to pass the bar.</v>

90
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>It was agreed that this would be the best course of on the Shy Hindu boy was now</v>

91
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>headed for the bright lights of London</v>

92
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>on August the 10th 1880 8 million left his family including his wife and his one</v>

93
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>month old son [inaudible] and he headed for Bombay where he bought it.</v>

94
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 1>A ship that was bound for London.</v>

95
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Before leaving though he was something to be the leader of his cost to warns him</v>

96
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>that if he went to England,</v>

97
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>he would be tempted to break the rules of Hinduism.</v>

98
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>He was told to either abandoned his plans,</v>

99
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.230
<v Speaker 1>will be excommunicated from the cost.</v>

100
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi accepted this consequence and he continued upon his way.</v>

101
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Fitting into Western culture though was that it was a shock to the 18 year olds,</v>

102
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

103
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It was so different,</v>

104
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>so what he had known back in India,</v>

105
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.661
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

106
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>he did his best to fit in buying a fine suit,</v>

107
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>complete with a leather gloves,</v>

108
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.000
<v Speaker 1>top hat and Silvertips cane.</v>

109
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.260
<v Speaker 1>He also paid for lessons and elocution manners and dumps.</v>

110
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>His biggest challenge was with regard to his diet.</v>

111
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>He had vowed to his mother that he was not going to eat meat,</v>

112
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but he was finding it very difficult to find restaurants that cater to</v>

113
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:53.940
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians.</v>

114
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>His chronic shyness prevented him from requesting alternatives,</v>

115
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>do what was on offer.</v>

116
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>That finally though you found a vegetarian restaurants along with a whole</v>

117
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 1>community of vegetarians and it was at this point so that he joins the nuns and</v>

118
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian society.</v>

119
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Just wait as difficulties with fitting into London in life.</v>

120
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi did well academically.</v>

121
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 1>He passed his law exams in June of 1891 his friends at the vegetarian society,</v>

122
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>they held a celebrator evening and is on it.</v>

123
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 1>When it came time to give a speech.</v>

124
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:20.671
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

125
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Mohan was so nervous that he simply rose and Tony said,</v>

126
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.643
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

127
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.663
<v Speaker 2>Okay</v>

128
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>on is returned to India.</v>

129
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Mohan was met at Bombay harbor by his older brother who bought some terrible</v>

130
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>

131
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>his mother,</v>

132
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but Levi had died in his absence moons.</v>

133
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Grief was compounded with the consequences of his overseas foray.</v>

134
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>He was now disfellowshipped from his cost in order to please his family members.</v>

135
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>He agreed to bathe in a sacred river in order to wash away the sins of</v>

136
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>England's.</v>

137
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>This precipitated his reentry into the cost going.</v>

138
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Z books for work is a lawyer in Bombay.</v>

139
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.131
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

140
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>his chronic shyness was still preventing him from making any advancements.</v>

141
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>He recalls how he fell is presenting his first case before the court saying my</v>

142
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>head was reeling and it felt as if the whole court was doing likewise.</v>

143
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.090
<v Speaker 1>He retreats it to the nes imposing town of Raj Carlton,</v>

144
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>just stablish to a small law office that shortly thereafter he received an offer</v>

145
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>from the much and two had been a friend of his father.</v>

146
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>This man was now based in South Africa and he needed a lawyer to help with the</v>

147
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>court case.</v>

148
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>The year long job was often to Gandhi and he accepted it.</v>

149
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Just finished recently becoming a father again.</v>

150
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 1>He kept his wife and two young sons under the camera of his brother and he</v>

151
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:37.631
<v Speaker 1>headed off a Durban South Africa in April of 1893 officer settling into his new</v>

152
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:38.691
<v Speaker 1>surroundings,</v>

153
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:38.931
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

154
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>He took the trains,</v>

155
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Pretoria where the court case was to be tried.</v>

156
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>He purchased a first cost ticket.</v>

157
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

158
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>on one of the stops the European men bolted,</v>

159
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>the car that he was in,</v>

160
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the men resented seeing an Indian and first costs and left to find the train</v>

161
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>conductor.</v>

162
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 1>The two men returned and has gone.</v>

163
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>D was wanting to go down to the third class section.</v>

164
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.841
<v Speaker 1>God's.</v>

165
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>He showed them his fitness costs tickets and refuse to move or to that's</v>

166
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>trained.</v>

167
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Security was cooled and gum dia was kicked off the train.</v>

168
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 1>He had to go to the rest of the way in a horse drawn carriage.</v>

169
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.281
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

170
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>the white passengers of that carriage,</v>

171
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>they refuse to lessen Indians it inside with them and he was made to sit on the</v>

172
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>outside foot board.</v>

173
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 1>He lays it recalls.</v>

174
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 1>The insult was more than I could bat.</v>

175
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.660
<v Speaker 1>This was the watershed experience of my hundred Gandhi's life as if by miracle</v>

176
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>he shook off his timid nature and stepped forward as a leader of the oppressed.</v>

177
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>When he arrived in Pretoria,</v>

178
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.930
<v Speaker 1>he called a meeting of the Indian community and gave the funniest speech of his</v>

179
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 1>life cooling for the Indians to stand up for their rights.</v>

180
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Once his work on the court case was completed,</v>

181
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi decided to stay and continue to fight the Indian rights.</v>

182
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.260
<v Speaker 1>In 1894 he established the natal Indian Congress to give Indians a political</v>

183
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

184
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>He established himself as a leader in the local community giving free legal</v>

185
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>advice and offering support.</v>

186
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>In 1896 off to three years in South Africa.</v>

187
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:56.931
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi,</v>

188
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>writtens India to connect his family.</v>

189
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>It returned with his wife and two sons who are now aged nine and five along with</v>

190
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>a nephew.</v>

191
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi demanded that his family,</v>

192
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>they dress as Europeans and eat with knives and forks as it was the way with</v>

193
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Indians in South Africa.</v>

194
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>This goal tension within his family.</v>

195
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Still two more songs were added to the family and the coming years.</v>

196
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 1>When the bow Walbro accounts in 1899 Gandhi fell to this.</v>

197
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>If the Indian supported the government,</v>

198
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>they would be rewarded with that or treatments.</v>

199
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>He organized an Indian ambulance corps who are a valuable asset to the army,</v>

200
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.233
<v Speaker 1>but the loyalty,</v>

201
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.280
<v Speaker 1>it wins unrewarded with the harsh treatment continuing during this time gone.</v>

202
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:35.240
<v Speaker 1>D develops the life philosophy,</v>

203
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>which was to going in for the remainder of his days.</v>

204
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>They called it [inaudible],</v>

205
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>which means devotion to the truth.</v>

206
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 1>The three core tenants of the belief where noncooperation,</v>

207
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>nonviolence and non possession.</v>

208
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>In 1906 the South African province of Transvaal enacted a law that required all</v>

209
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Indians to register and be given identity cards.</v>

210
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>The police were allowed to stop and demand their registration as any time.</v>

211
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.800
<v Speaker 1>No other group have this requirement.</v>

212
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Guns he advocated the use of saw Takahata counsel the law.</v>

213
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>He told people not to register.</v>

214
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.411
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

215
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:07.771
<v Speaker 1>he ends.</v>

216
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Many others were thrown in jail,</v>

217
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 1>but Gandhi taught that righteous imprisonments was an honorable thing.</v>

218
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 1>The concept of Satyagraha took hold and Gandia established a number of</v>

219
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>cytochromes settlements.</v>

220
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>The people in the settlements,</v>

221
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>they practiced non possession,</v>

222
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 1>living a simple and austere life guns.</v>

223
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>He also organized a large coal miners' strike the men practice noncooperation by</v>

224
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>refusing to work and nonviolence by refusing to react when they were attacked</v>

225
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>spinal authorities.</v>

226
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>In July of 1914 the South African government passed the Indian really fact which</v>

227
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>wins some way to righting the wrongs that had been heaped upon the Indian</v>

228
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

229
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.280
<v Speaker 1>The 20 years of struggle that Gandhi had put into the cause.</v>

230
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>We're largely responsible for these changes and after this he was ready to</v>

231
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 1>return to India,</v>

232
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>bringing his philosophy with him.</v>

233
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And do you know what else he brought back to India with him?</v>

234
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>His famous glosses?</v>

235
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:57.781
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

236

00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:26.971

253
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Now this isn't actually on the talking points,</v>

254
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>but I believe what is perhaps the biggest testament,</v>

255
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 1>the glasses USA,</v>

256
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 1>is that this is my second pair of sunglasses from them.</v>

257
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 1>A few months ago,</v>

258
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I lost a power while I was on holiday and by lost,</v>

259
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I literally flushed them down the toilet by accident.</v>

260
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I really couldn't be making this stuff up and I had such a good experience with</v>

<v Speaker 1>was Indian self rule.</v>

286
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi also challenged his own people to look at the unfair treatments within</v>

287
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>their own culture.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the unfair working conditions.</v>

295
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Despite his belief in nonviolence gone.</v>

297
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.051
<v Speaker 1>The wars ends,</v>

298
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 1>the government Pasternack's making it illegal for any group to organize and</v>

299
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 1>oppositions and the government's gone.</v>

301
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.240
<v Speaker 1>the whole of India came to a standstill.</v>

302
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It was clear evidence of the power there's gone.</v>

303
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Dee was able to wield yes when reports filtered in that some Indians had</v>

304
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:57.910

<v Speaker 1>He was bitterly disappointed.</v>

306
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.500
<v Speaker 1>He knew at that point that as people as a whole,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And so a law was passed banning any gatherings of Indians in the city of</v>

336
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>The trial gave him the platform to expound upon the unfair treatment of Indians</v>

337
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and his refusal to cooperate with unjust laws.</v>

343
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.111
<v Speaker 1>For centuries,</v>

344
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:47.920
<v Speaker 1>the two groups had been at loggerheads with one another with Vaughn and clashes</v>

345
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 1>often breaking out.</v>

346
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi saw that independence would be impossible without unity and he was</v>

347
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>determined to bring these two groups together.</v>

348
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi undertook a hunger fast as a tool to bring the Hindus and the Muslims</v>

352
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:09.550
<v Speaker 1>stop suffering.</v>

353

<v Speaker 1>from seawater in India.</v>

362
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.051
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

363
00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>they were able to make huge profits from their salt tax.</v>

00:15:45.641 --> 00:15:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi walked out into the sea water to bathe on Ezra town.</v>

368
00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:52.720
<v Speaker 1>He picks up a handful of salts in defiance of the salt act.</v>

369
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.940
<v Speaker 1>This act was a signal for his countryman and up and down India's coastline.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mahatma officials now realize that this man held a powerful sway over the</v>

376
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:12.070
<v Speaker 1>masses.</v>

377
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.350
<v Speaker 1>He simply could not be ignored any longer.</v>

378
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.640
<v Speaker 1>The more the British government,</v>

379
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:19.330
<v Speaker 1>both in India and at home were being pressured by other governments to release</v>

380
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi from jail.</v>

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.750
<v Speaker 1>D would cool off the demonstrations.</v>

386
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>The prisoners would will be released and Indians would be allowed to make their</v>

387
00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:33.484
<v Speaker 1>own salts.</v>

388
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.890
<v Speaker 1>In 1931 Gandhi traveled to London to represent the Indian national congress as</v>

389
00:16:37.891 --> 00:16:40.090

399
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Surely after returning to India,</v>

400
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi was again arrested for inciting civil disobedience.</v>

401
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.900
<v Speaker 1>While he was in prison,</v>

402
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.470
<v Speaker 1>the British government passed a law that discriminated against the untouchables</v>

403
00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:21.580
<v Speaker 1>and court proceedings.</v>

404
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Gonzi was infuriated,</v>

405
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:27.310
<v Speaker 1>doesn't announce that he would not eat until this law was revoked fairing,</v>

406
00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that his death would create a martyrdom that would doom them in the eyes of the</v>

407
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:31.120
<v Speaker 1>welds.</v>

408
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.470
<v Speaker 1>The authorities caved in.</v>

409
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.860
<v Speaker 1>The law was rescinded when Britain declared war on Germany.</v>

410
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:40.600
<v Speaker 1>In 1939 Gandhi told the authorities that Indians would only join the war fs if</v>

411
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.640
<v Speaker 1>they were promised their independence.</v>

412
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

413
00:17:43.511 --> 00:17:46.240
<v Speaker 1>he started a quit India movement as always,</v>

414
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:48.600
<v Speaker 1>the plans for the campaign to be nonviolent,</v>

415
00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>especially things soon got out of hands and riots broke out across the country.</v>

416
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 1>The authorities blamed Gandhians one small,</v>

417
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.730
<v Speaker 1>he was thrown in jail.</v>

418
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>His beloved wife,</v>

419
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:58.211
<v Speaker 1>Christa,</v>

420
00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:00.490
<v Speaker 1>was also imprisoned at this time and age.</v>

421
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 1>She soon became ill,</v>

422
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>dying in custody.</v>

423
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>On February the 22nd 1944 following his wife's death,</v>

424
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi grew weak with malaria.</v>

425
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 1>The authorities agreed to release him then may of 1944 and he went to Bombay to</v>

426
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 1>recover and recuperate the end of World War II.</v>

427
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Saw great person on its knees though Victoria,</v>

428
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:23.400
<v Speaker 1>since it's spent exorbitant amounts in the war efforts and now no longer have</v>

429
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:23.881
<v Speaker 1>the results,</v>

430
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:27.370
<v Speaker 1>is to maintain its role within India with little choice in the massive person</v>

431
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 1>offered India its independence.</v>

432
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It was the grand victory that Gandhi had been fighting for for the past 30</v>

433
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

434
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Even though the nation was now free to rule itself,</v>

435
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>India was still plagues with deep division between Hindus and most of them's the</v>

436
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 1>only solution seemed to be to divide the country up and do Hindu,</v>

437
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>India and most of them Pakistan.</v>

438
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 1>This was a move that was greatly displeasing to Gandhi who loaned the unity</v>

439
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 1>between these two groups.</v>

440
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.030
<v Speaker 1>In the weeks following the creation of Pakistan,</v>

441
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>there were violence clashes between Muslims and Hindus up and down the country.</v>

442
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Massek as a could throughout 1947 with both sides being equally responsible for</v>

443
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 1>the bloodshed.</v>

444
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of thousands of people died and there were riots in most of the major</v>

445
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

446
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 1>On January the 13th of 1948 the 78 year old gone day began the fost in order to</v>

447
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 1>get the madness to stop.</v>

448
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 1>He was so despondent that he refused to even drink water.</v>

449
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Despite the physical pain that he was in.</v>

450
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>He still lead a pram.</v>

451
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Meeting from his bet is wads were broadcast around the entire country.</v>

452
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Five days into his fost.</v>

453
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Muslim and Hindu leaders agreed to a piece of court.</v>

454
00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.571
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

455
00:19:37.571 --> 00:19:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi was still very concerned about the direction the fledgling nation was</v>

456
00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:41.830
<v Speaker 1>taking.</v>

457
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:46.090
<v Speaker 1>The new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was constantly at odds with his deputy</v>

458
00:19:46.091 --> 00:19:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Vallabhbhai Patel and gone.</v>

459
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Z counseled both men to make peace.</v>

460
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.940
<v Speaker 1>On January the 30th 1948 he was in a meeting with Patel just after 5:00 PM he</v>

461
00:19:54.941 --> 00:19:56.650
<v Speaker 1>came out into the gods and a bill,</v>

462
00:19:56.651 --> 00:20:00.670
<v Speaker 1>a house in Delhi to offer prowess weakened from his recent Fasti,</v>

463
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.930
<v Speaker 1>leans on two of his followers for support as he walks a crowd of some 500 people</v>

464
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:09.190
<v Speaker 1>were waiting to greet him as he made his way to the platform or Hindu extremist</v>

465
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Angus Gandhi's leniency towards the Muslims snapped forward.</v>

466
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.350
<v Speaker 1>He bowed before the Mahatma and then pulled out a pistol and fired three shots</v>

467
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and succession of pointblank range within half an hour.</v>

468
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.300
<v Speaker 1>The last breath of life.</v>

469
00:20:22.301 --> 00:20:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It seeped out of his body and the great soul with no more.</v>

470
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.360
<v Speaker 1>When he had the news of Mahatmas death,</v>

471
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.990
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister stated the light has gone out of our lives and there is</v>

472
00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:33.010
<v Speaker 1>darkness everywhere.</v>

473
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds.</v>

474
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi was a light,</v>

475
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.080
<v Speaker 1>not just to the people of India,</v>

476
00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but those of the entire wells.</v>

477
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.110
<v Speaker 1>His funeral procession through the streets of Delhi was attended by more than 2</v>

478
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.270
<v Speaker 1>million people and years after his death,</v>

479
00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 1>countless of the millions,</v>

480
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>including a young Baptist minister from Georgia named Martin Luther King,</v>

481
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 1>would find inspiration in his words and in his legacy.</v>

482
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 1>So I really hope you found that video.</v>
