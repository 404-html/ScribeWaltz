00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.890
Just before we get started with today's video,

2
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:05.820
I do want to thank brilliance for making it possible to support biographics and

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.670
<v 0>His was the brain that oversaw the most destructive projects in all of human</v>

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:25.410
history.
It's won a war by unleashing unimaginable horror in the process,

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.530
catapulting the world into the nuclear age for his efforts.

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.070
He was accused of being a Russian spy and sidelined by the government.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.690
In this week's biographics graphics,

11
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:38.691
we're taking a look at the life and the work of j Robert Oppenheimer Junius.

12
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.990
Robert Oppenheimer was born on April the 20 seconds 1904 in New York City.

13
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.860
His father Julius had fled Jewish persecution in Europe as a teenager.

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.710
His mother Ballo was also Jewish with that family,

15
00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:59.200
having been a New York for several generations,

16
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.080
the couple were married in 1903 with Julius.

17
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:05.590
He was known as Robert the end of their first child.
A second son,

18
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.070
frank came along in 1912 when Robert was eight years old.

19
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.340
The family lived in an upscale apartments on New York's west side.

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.120
Julius had built a successful textile importing business and and there was a

21
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.880
painter they employed to cook sevenths and to show fat.

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.770
Life for young Robert was structured and formal with dinner as requiring a suit

23
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:24.604
and tie.

24
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.940
<v 0>When Robert was five years old,
the family took a vacation to Germany.</v>

26
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.240
There he met his grandfather who gave him a collection of minerals.

27
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.380
He was mesmerized by the stones needing to a lifelong obsession with rock

28
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:46.100
collecting.
When he was 11 he joins the New York mineralogical club.
A year later,

29
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.400
he presented his first scientific paper.

30
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.180
Julia sent his son to the best school he could find the New York school for

31
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:53.110
ethical culture.

32
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.650
Robert attended from the second grade right through to college graduation.

33
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.670
The focus of the education was science,
literature and moral law.

34
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.330
Robert was an eight grade students who completely devoted himself to his
studies.

35
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.510
As a result,
he doesn't have much of a social life friends.

36
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:09.340
They were few and far between.
In fact,

37
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:11.620
according to his high school English teacher,
he once said,

38
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.660
I'm the loneliest man in the world.

39
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.350
Robert was extremely socially awkward as a teenager.
From the start,

40
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:20.980
he considered himself the smartest guy in the room and this led to an arrogance

41
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:22.690
which was off putting to as peers.

42
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.840
They were also so put off by his prim and proper nature.

43
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.353
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.440
<v 0>After graduating from high school,</v>

45
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:36.740
he attended Harvard in order to pursue a serious scientific studies.

46
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.800
He majored in chemistry,
but soon fell in love with physics.

47
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.730
He was admitted into graduate studies in physics and began studying under the

48
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.220
famous experimentalists,
Percy Bridgman,

49
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.540
all the the knew straight away that this was what he wanted to do with his life.

50
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.000
He took a rigorous course load each semester,

51
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.030
which allowed him to graduate in just three years.
At that time,

52
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.680
the American college's couldn't compete with the physics laboratories.
Europe,

53
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.270
the science world was enthralled with the physics revelations of Albert Einstein

54
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.010
and for any,
it's serious up and coming.

55
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:09.940
American physicist crossing the Atlantic was an essential requirements.

56
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.770
In 1924 Oppenheimer was admitted to Kevin dish laboratory and Cambridge England.

57
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.610
This was one of the most renowned and nuclear physics labs in the world.

58
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.700
The lab was under the direction of Ernest Rutherford who had already won the

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.940
Nobel prize for splitting the atom.

60
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.500
Oppenheimer was assigned to a team of researchers under the leadership of Jj

61
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.080
Thomson,
who in 1897 had discovered the electron.

62
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.110
It was the ultimate setting for a budding physics genius,

63
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:38.680
but Oppenheimer quickly realized that it wasn't really cut out for it.

64
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.650
P and experimental physics that just didn't Gel.

65
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.370
He wasn't able to keep up with the required workloads and you want my suffered a

66
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.790
mental breakdown by now.

67
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:50.380
We had developed a habit as a chain smoker and it's often neglected basic

68
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:54.010
hygiene and nutritional practices as he got bogged down with his work,

69
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.600
but trying as he may,
he was unable to keep up with the required workload.

70
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.811
Hey,

71
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.610
depressed and overwhelmed up and I went to see a psychiatrist who told him that

72
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.550
he was suffering from schizophrenia.
The prognosis,

73
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.230
it was not good with longterm institutionalization being the standard treatment

74
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:20.620
at the time.
Oppenheimer refuse to believe this diagnosis.

75
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.340
He took a vacation to Paris with his friend Francis Ferguson.
However,

76
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.290
he wasn't exactly good company being consumed with his own melancholy Ferguson

77
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.740
drying to cheer him up by breaking the news that he was going to marry his

78
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.750
girlfriends.
When he heard this,

79
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.780
something inside Oppenheimer's fragile mind snapped and he leaped upon Ferguson

80
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.510
and proceeded to strangle him.
Ferguson was able to fend them off,

81
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.170
but from then on he became convinced that his friends had serious mental

82
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:48.004
problems.

83
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.160
<v 0>In 1926 off and nine it took up a position at the University of Gottingen in</v>

85
00:04:58.161 --> 00:04:58.700
Germany.

86
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.710
This was the sensor of theoretical physics in Europe and Oppenheimer landed

87
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.390
right in the middle of a revolution in the field.

88
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.500
He found himself rubbing shoulders with and learning from the premier names in

89
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:11.840
quantum physics,
including Enrico Fermi,

90
00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:15.380
Wolfgang Pauli and Verner Heisenberg here.
Finally,

91
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.390
Oppenheimer found his perfect fit.

92
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.530
In 1927 he received his phd in physics.
Over the next two years,

93
00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:26.120
he established himself as one of the leading physicists in Europe publishing 16

94
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:29.080
papers on quantum physics.
American physicist said,

95
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.900
been left behind by the European quantum physics revolution.

96
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.650
Many of the professors refuse to accept the new counselor.

97
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.200
Intuitive theories that went against the grain of everything they had known.

98
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.310
This left a slew of Iga physicists excited about what was happening in Europe

99
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.470
and left out in the cold open.
I'm a sore,

100
00:05:45.471 --> 00:05:49.430
saw himself as the vehicle by which the European advances in quantum physics

101
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:52.310
could be introduced to American physicists.

102
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.490
His first position back in the state swells as a professor at the University of

103
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.740
California Berkeley.
He now has a,

104
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.250
had a brimming with knowledge and lecture halls filled with students,

105
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.570
see what you get to learn from him.

106
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.380
The problem was he didn't know how to teach his social awkwardness.

107
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:15.920
It certainly didn't tell me that he would become tongue tied in front of his

108
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.360
students.
When he did speak,
his ideas would come out as a jumbled mass of words.

109
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:23.090
That's simply served to confuse those in attendance.

110
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.680
By the end of his first semester,

111
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.030
that was just one student remaining who was taking his class for credit.

112
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.370
Fortunately though,
things got better.

113
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.820
He applied himself to his teaching and slowly improved his disability.

114
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.180
He managed to cut out the verbiage to pare down his lectures,

115
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:42.290
making them both understandable and exciting as a result of the students who

116
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.850
referred to him as puppy.
Again,

117
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.040
flocking to his lectures within a couple of years,

118
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:49.370
a cult of personality he had developed around him and he had his own groupies

119
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:51.500
who were known as ops Boyers.

120
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.430
He relished the attention and he gave his time generously to a students.

121
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.870
Often discussions would be hands off to class with students even ending up at

122
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:00.560
his home.

123
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.850
The subject usually more from physics to science to art and literature runs

124
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:07.820
would be fueled by generous quantities of alcohol.

125
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.510
While teaching at Berkeley Oppenheimer that continued his physics research,

126
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.760
the published more papers on quantum physics but did not make any groundbreaking

127
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.600
discoveries.
He did,
however,

128
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:20.960
convert the Berkeley lab into a world class facility,

129
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.220
establishing the new quantum physics as a legitimate science in America.

130
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.780
Often high mag totally immersed himself in his work and the agitation of his

131
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:29.480
students.

132
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.890
He did not own a phone or radio or even read the newspaper when his mind wasn't

133
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:38.090
on physics.
He would be studying Hindu mythology or the ancient classics.

134
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.841
As a result,

135
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:42.950
he was totally divorced from the outside world when the Great Depression struck

136
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:45.530
following the 1929 Wall Street crash,

137
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.210
he was simply none the wiser being NC United from the effects thanks to a trust

138
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.090
fund.
Now,
just before we get into Oppenheimer's work during the war,

139
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.880
let me take a quick break,
just tell you a bit about brilliance.
As always,

140
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:58.340
I know mid role ads in the middle here,
they're not perfect,

141
00:07:58.341 --> 00:07:59.780
but when we started biographics,

142
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:03.920
we really wanted it to be a longer form content channel and well sponsors.

143
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:04.790
They make it possible.

144
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.460
Now you've heard me talk about brilliant before that we're learning platform

145
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:09.470
that focuses on active learning.

146
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.800
This is where you're given a short bit of information on the scientific concepts

147
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.860
and then you're asked to solve a problem based on that information.

148
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.890
It's an incredibly effective way to learn right now.
Brilliant.

149
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:22.640
Have something that would be perfect as a new year's resolution,

150
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.370
even if that new year's resolution is coming a little bit late.

151
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.510
It's called daily problems,

152
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:29.780
and it's five minutes a day that you can use to exercise your brain and learn

153
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:30.530
something new.

154
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.520
Each problem provides you the context and a framework that you need to tackle
it.

155
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.930
That means you can learn concepts by applying them.
That's that active learning.

156
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:39.350
Again,

157
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.970
this sort of short daily practice can lead you from curiosity to mastery and far

158
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:45.050
less time than you would like.

159
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.880
So go to brilliant.org forward slash biographics and finish your day a little

160
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:52.430
smarter.

Let's get back to Oppenheimer.

164
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.490
It was the effect that the depression had on the lives of the students that made

165
00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:15.950
Oppenheimer aware of its devastating impacts.

166
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.520
This broke him in awareness of just how much political and economic events could

167
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.680
affect people's lives.
This is awareness.

168
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.800
It was strengthened as he began to take notice of what was happening in Nazi

169
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:25.400
Germany.

170
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.570
Having Jewish heritage himselfie looked on with great concern at the rise of

171
00:09:29.571 --> 00:09:32.540
Hitler,
yet it took a woman to transform up at home.

172
00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:34.430
His political concerns into action.

173
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.510
Jean tap block was the graduate students who was studying for a degree in

174
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.750
psychology.
She was also a member of the Communist Party.

175
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.590
Tagalog introduced Oppenheimer to the wells of radical politics.

176
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.390
He joined a number of institutions aligned with the Communists,

177
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:53.120
so there is no evidence that he actually became a card carrying member of the

178
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.601
Communist Party.
However,

179
00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:58.160
in 1936 his brother frank moved to California and he did join the party.

180
00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.120
Oppenheimer.

181
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.020
He fell in love with tatlock and they pursued a tempestuous relationship between

182
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:08.021
1936 in 1939 with the ends of his contact with tap block his interest in

183
00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:12.800
communism,
it wanes and by the 1940s he had become rather disenchanted with it,

184
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.060
mainly due to hearing reports of what life was really like in the Soviet Union.

185
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.770
Yet despite his later recessions that is flooded with communism was nothing more

186
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:26.750
than a boyhood fling accusations that he was a Russian sympathizer would dog him

187
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.470
for the rest of his life.
In the wake of his breakup with Tatlock Oppenheimer,

188
00:10:30.471 --> 00:10:32.990
that began a relationship with a woman named Kitty Harrison.

189
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.140
There was however one problem and that's the kitty was married.

190
00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:40.610
She was in fact on her third marriage with her husband to being a British
doctor.

191
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.660
She soon divorced the doctor with Oppenheimer up becoming a fourth husband on

192
00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:46.700
November the first 1914

193
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.840
the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December the seventh 1941 changed the lives of

194
00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:00.500
senior physicists in the United States profoundly overnight.

195
00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:04.610
Their theoretical research,
it was being called upon to help win the war.

196
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.450
The first challenge presented to the physicists was to develop a radar system.

197
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.070
The country's top physicists.

198
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:12.310
They gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,

199
00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:13.850
his radiation laboratory,

200
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.990
ready to throw themselves into what they thought would be the great work that

201
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:18.824
would win the war.

202
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.690
Then in September of 1942 work began on a program that proved to be far more

203
00:11:23.691 --> 00:11:25.730
impactful than the radar project,

204
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.360
and that was of course the development of a nuclear bomb.

205
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.230
In 1939 three German physicists discovered nuclear fission,

206
00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:37.220
which enabled a massive amounts of energy to be released when neutron struck or

207
00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:41.870
uranium nucleus among the first to recognize the massive destructive potential

208
00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:42.740
of this technology.

209
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:46.910
If it can be harnessed into the form of a bomb where two Hungarian scientists,

210
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.450
they made it their mission to warm the presidents of the United States that he

211
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:53.350
needed to develop such a bond before the Germans did.
Yup.

212
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.650
These minus scientists could not get anyone to listen to them.

213
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.970
It was only when they secured the support of the world famous scientist Albert

214
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.610
Einstein,
that they were able to get President Roosevelt's attention.

215
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

216
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.720
<v 0>As a direct result of a Letteri received from Einstein,</v>

217
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.390
Roosevelt created the advisory committee on uranium.

218
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.050
The committee began to stockpile uranium but didn't move fast enough for

219
00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:19.720
Roosevelts.

220
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.820
It was soon dissolved and replaced with the National Research Defense Council.

221
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:25.020
The NRDC.

222
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.760
The council was put in the hands of the army with Brigadier General Leslie

223
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.593
Groves having oversight.

224
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.010
The project was given an innocuous name as to not give away its purpose.

225
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.500
Grove's called it the Manhattan project.

226
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.790
Since 1932 Oppenheimer had been doing his own private research into nuclear

227
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:42.360
physics.

228
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.900
He desperately wanted to get involved in the project in any way that would

229
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:47.370
advance America's security.

230
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.170
In 1941 he was invited to a top secret meeting of scientists to brainstorm how

231
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.280
to build a nuclear bomb.

232
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.150
He was put in charge of the physics group who were given the task of actually

233
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.680
designing said bomb.

234
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.000
By July of 1943 he had officially joins the Manhattan project,

235
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.540
the Manhattan project.
It was not based in one single location.

236
00:13:06.541 --> 00:13:09.660
Rather there were a number of laboratories located around the country.

237
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.630
Each tackling a specific aspect of the project.

238
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.530
The biggest challenge was the creation of the bomb itself and this task was to

239
00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:20.760
be overseen by often high.
The base of the operation was Los Alamos,

240
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:25.220
so deserted area or in the north central part of New Mexico.
Dislocation,

241
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.180
which was selected by Oppenheimer himself,

242
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.800
was to be his home for the next three years and older boy's school was renovated

243
00:13:31.801 --> 00:13:36.240
to serve as a base camp with a number of barracks being moved into service homes

244
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:39.420
for the physicists who would work on the project with the facility ready.

245
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.020
Oppenheimer traveled the country in search of the best scientific minds to help

246
00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:46.860
him build the bond.
In addition to former students eat cold on top physicists.

247
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.590
So number of him,
what Exxon's or Nazi Germany,

248
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.960
if he was concerned that he wouldn't find the people that you need it.

249
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.590
He needed to have been here originally estimated that he would need 30 people,

250
00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:59.370
but scientists from all over the country were energized by the opportunity and

251
00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:04.010
by the end of the war,
they were more than 6,000 people living at Los Alamos.

252
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.960
This is only the primitive living conditions and the oppressive desert.

253
00:14:06.961 --> 00:14:09.780
He's the scientists,
relish that time at Los Alamos.

254
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.530
Many of them have their families with them and spend that time off hiking and

255
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:14.990
skiing.
We'll leave at the southwest.

256
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.840
While they weren't keen on was the seemingly over the top secrecy imposed by the

257
00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:20.790
military who are ever present.

258
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.510
Every scientist was under constant surveillance and none more so than

259
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.090
Oppenheimer himself.
During his time in Los Alamos,

260
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:28.920
the government tapped his phone,
opened his mail,

261
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.580
and had men follow him everywhere as overseer of the project.

262
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.300
Oppenheimer perhaps have not only contend with the invasion of his own privacy,

263
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:40.380
but to mediate between the often feisty scientists in the military.

264
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.400
He constantly reminded the physicists do keep the big picture in mind.

265
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:49.430
They were involved in a once in a lifetime struggle for the very salvation of

266
00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:53.240
mankind.
By February of 1945 that brains at Los Alamos said,

267
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.400
come up with two designs for the atomic bomb.

268
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.520
They were code named little boy and fat man.

269
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.780
Little boy was a uranium based upon while fat man use plutonium.

270
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.770
The scientists were so confident in the design of little boy that they deemed it

271
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.280
unnecessary to test,
but fat man,
he required testing popping.

272
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.600
I'm a designer to test fat man near Alamogordo New Mexico.

273
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.590
It was a 60 mile stretch of desolate landscape from north to south and 40 miles

274
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:21.050
east to west to carry out the explosion safely.

275
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:23.870
They had to ensure that the wind was traveling in the right direction.

276
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.890
If it wasn't radioactive dust and debris,

277
00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:28.380
you could travel over residential areas,
bands,

278
00:15:28.381 --> 00:15:31.550
or wait for what seemed like forever just to get the right conditions.

279
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.540
During this time,

280
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.530
Oppenheimer was wound up with stress that things could go wrong and that they

281
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:39.980
would unleash destruction on the citizens of New Mexico.
Finally,

282
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.180
the conditions were right.

283
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.270
The explosion took place on July the 16th 1945 the resulting flash was visible

284
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.590
from three states.
The mushroom boundaries,
38,000 feet into the air.
Well,

285
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.370
the crater that was blown into the ground was half a mile wide.

286
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.410
The other scientists scattered at the site,

287
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.700
cheered enthusiastically and the wave of the explosion,
but not Oppenheimer.

288
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.510
He found the situation.
Apps do quote from the Hindu text,
the Bhagavad Gita.

289
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.260
<v 1>No,
I am to come to a destroyer of worlds.</v>

290
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.570
<v 0>The decision to make use of the bombs was now in the hands of President Harry s</v>

291
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.130
Truman.
Often much soul searching.

292
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.700
He decided to use it on the Japanese in order to force them to surrender.

293
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.770
On August the sixth 1945 the beat 29 bomber in no to gay dropped little by over

294
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:31.850
the city of Hiroshima.

295
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.090
90% of the buildings were instantly destroyed along with 66,000 people.

296
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.120
However,
the immediate Japanese surrender was not forthcoming.

297
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.370
On August the ninth Fatboy was dropped on the city of Nagasaki.

298
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:48.570
You're causing 40 2005 the deaths,
the double whammy,
it was too much.

299
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.450
On August the 14th 1945 Emperor Hirohito announced the Japanese surrender when

300
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.960
he first heard that the bombs had brought about the desired effect.

301
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.190
Oppenheimer rejoiced along with the rest of the nation on laser reflection.

302
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:01.670
However,

303
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.670
he took in the realization of just what he had unleashed upon the world.

304
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.750
On October the 16th 1945 Oppenheimer relinquished his physician at Los Alamos.

305
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.810
He returned to Caltech before taking up a position as director of the Institute

306
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.840
of Advanced Study at Princeton University.

307
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.950
But it's after three years of excitement,
power,
and and cutting edge research.

308
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.120
He founds the university life whole rather mundane with information about the

309
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.280
Manhattan project now in the public domain,

310
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.090
Oppenheimer became a household figure with his face appearing on the cover of

311
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:38.924
Time magazine.

312
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.920
He now used his position of prominence do lecture around the country on what he

313
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:46.760
felt the United States should do with that new found nuclear technology.

314
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.020
From his unique perspective,

315
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:52.650
he appreciated the technological achievement as well as the killing potential

316
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.730
that did it unleashed in our felt a responsibility to ensure that its future use

317
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.650
was for good and not evil.

318
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.210
He advocated for international sanctions on nuclear power,
but all to no avail.

319
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.140
At the same time,

320
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.010
he appreciated that having nuclear power was a huge advantage to the American

321
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.350
defense program,
so rather than trying to stop it,

322
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.970
he works on how to keep it from going out of control.
Now,
in the postwar years,

323
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:18.300
a new enemy of the United States emerged.
The Soviet Union,

324
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.560
a Cold War ensued leading to an arms race between what we're now the two weld

325
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:25.760
superpowers.
The Americans.
Of course,
they had the nuclear advanced age,

326
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.360
but all of that changed in September of 1949 when the Soviet set off a nuclear

327
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:31.500
explosion of their own,

328
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.550
the Americans were taken off guard having believed that the Russians were well

329
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:36.270
behind them.

330
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.050
The U S government suspected that spies Mr shed vital information with the

331
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:43.780
Soviets,
often the game under immediate suspicion thanks to his form,

332
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:45.330
a connection with the communist party.

333
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.120
Meanwhile,
the Americans rush defines a response to the Russian bomb.

334
00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.550
Discussions were held about a new type of bomb,

335
00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.240
one that was a thousand times more destructive than those that had been dropped

336
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:04.840
over Japan.
It was a bomb that was going to be powered by hydrogen,

337
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.650
all the nine that was opposed to the hydrogen bomb fearing that it would become

338
00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:12.260
a weapon of genocide,
but president dream and decided to go ahead anyway,

339
00:19:12.261 --> 00:19:17.261
and then the hydrogen bomb code named Mike was exploded in 1952 in November of

340
00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:21.610
1953 the FBI received a letter from a former government official alleging that

341
00:19:21.611 --> 00:19:23.440
Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy.

342
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.550
It was enough to bring the full power of the Mccarthy Communist witch hunts down

343
00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:29.740
upon him Oppenheim the security clearance.

344
00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:33.580
It was immediate be revoked or three men investigation was then undertaken.

345
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:34.630
As it progressed,

346
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:38.320
it became obvious that he was really being investigated for his opposition to

347
00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:42.190
the hydrogen bomb project rather than his supposed ties to the Soviets.

348
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.600
The resulting report permanently shut up and Oppenheimer out of any involvement

349
00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:51.160
in government affairs due to what it termed the proof of fundamental defects in

350
00:19:51.161 --> 00:19:51.994
his character,

351
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.180
following the humiliation of his ouster from the government's Oppenheimer

352
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.800
returns of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1963 with the McCarthy red scare.

353
00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:00.640
Long in the past,

354
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:05.620
the government offered an olive branch to Oppenheimer by awarding him the Enrico

355
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.870
Fermi Award for excellence and nuclear research.
Still,

356
00:20:07.871 --> 00:20:11.950
he never fully recovered from the humiliation of the 1950s four years later on

357
00:20:11.951 --> 00:20:16.870
February the 18th 1967 he died of throat cancer.
He was 62 years old,

358
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.320
so I really hope you found that video.
