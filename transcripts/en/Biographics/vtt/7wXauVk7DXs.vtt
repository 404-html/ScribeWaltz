00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] has a military genius,</v>

2
00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>a tactician without peer at the age of 35 having just ground himself,</v>

3
00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the first emperor of France,</v>

4
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>he said about conquering all of Europe.</v>

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>His name was Napoleon Bonaparte,</v>

6
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>and above all he was a master propagandist.</v>

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>He made use of his extraordinary way with words,</v>

8
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>do publish political manifestos and newspapers,</v>

9
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>and later his autobiography,</v>

10
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>he regularly commissioned portraits and sculptures and was acutely aware of how</v>

11
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>to present himself in the best light.</v>

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Even when he made moves to crown himself emperor,</v>

13
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>he used propaganda and political.</v>

14
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Now to convince the populace that it was their idea.</v>

15
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon has aroused one of two emotions,</v>

16
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>hatred or loyalty.</v>

17
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Everything around him seemed bigger than life.</v>

18
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Yet he has none of the physical traits that we associate with power.</v>

19
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>He was short at five foot two had extremely pale skin,</v>

20
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>small delicate hands,</v>

21
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.570
<v Speaker 1>and a large head set on a short stout neck.</v>

22
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.490
<v Speaker 1>his inner self belief projected the aura of invincibility that made him a</v>

24
00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>natural leader of men.</v>

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It led him to the dizzying heights of Victory Am's,</v>

26
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the crushing despair of to feet.</v>

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And this week's biographics.</v>

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>We discover the real Napoleon Bonaparte</v>

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>in the spring of 1769 the tiny islands nation of Corsica was under siege,</v>

30
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.621
<v Speaker 1>a hardy bands.</v>

31
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:34.921
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

32
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:35.101
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

33
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Patriots determines to repel the French army that had invaded their lambs.</v>

34
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>They never stood a chance that after a year of fighting death and carnage,</v>

35
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>the rebels were a fetus.</v>

36
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>The survivors trudge through the mountains back to their homes.</v>

37
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Among them was that easier and Carlo Bonaparte?</v>

38
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Let's easier.</v>

39
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It was six months pregnant.</v>

40
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>It was the day of the Feast of assumption.</v>

41
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>On August,</v>

42
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>1517 69 went letizia.</v>

43
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It gave birth to her second child and he was named Napoleon Napoleon.</v>

44
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>His father gave up the flag.</v>

45
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Of course it can independence.</v>

46
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Once French victory was a shirt he refused to fight on in the mountains with his</v>

47
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>former Patriot holdouts,</v>

48
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the 23 year old university student and ingratiated himself to the French</v>

49
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>overlords and quickly took on the trappings of French privileged.</v>

50
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>It was something that his second son would never forgive him for viewing his</v>

51
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>father as a traitor who had betrayed his countryman.</v>

52
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Collar then entered upon a law practice.</v>

53
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Before long he had won election to the course of an assembly.</v>

54
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>He became accepted among the elite.</v>

55
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:29.521
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

56
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>it can society and was viewed with favor by the French rulers.</v>

57
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

58
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>The more successful he became,</v>

59
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>the more it drove a wedge between him and his second son.</v>

60
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>In contrast to how he viewed his father,</v>

61
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>the younger Polian Sims,</v>

62
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>he adored his mother.</v>

63
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 1>There's easier,</v>

64
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>was a strong willed on the woman of her 13 pregnancies.</v>

65
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>She ended up with eight children.</v>

66
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh half disciplinarian.</v>

67
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>She would tolerate no nonsense.</v>

68
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>We have Napoleon would lead to reminisce that all of his success in life was due</v>

69
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>to the training of that he had received at his mother's knee,</v>

70
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.090
<v Speaker 1>the and set foot on the French mainland for the first time in the winter of 1778</v>

71
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.080
<v Speaker 1>his father having security in that position at the prestigious Royal Military</v>

72
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.030
<v Speaker 1>College at Brienne in northern France.</v>

73
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon though he hated us,</v>

74
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.320
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to the warmth of the Mediterranean,</v>

75
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.280
<v Speaker 1>the harsh climate,</v>

76
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.510
<v Speaker 1>shift him to the bone,</v>

77
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 1>just top it off.</v>

78
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.430
<v Speaker 1>The skinny uncoordinated country by could hardly speak any French,</v>

79
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.700
<v Speaker 1>any one of the facts that he was a scholarship by into country bumpkin and the</v>

80
00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:34.700
<v Speaker 1>loyal Corsican with a strange accident would have been enough to make the</v>

81
00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:39.260
<v Speaker 1>bullies targets and yet somehow Napoleon accustomed himself to life at Brienne.</v>

82
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.890
<v Speaker 1>His stubbornness and tough exterior made him immune to the taunts of is more</v>

83
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:43.431
<v Speaker 1>privileged.</v>

84
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Classmates seem they,</v>

85
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:45.770
<v Speaker 1>along with his teachers,</v>

86
00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:47.180
<v Speaker 1>lost interest in the Sullen,</v>

87
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:48.530
<v Speaker 1>always serious Bonaparte.</v>

88
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon,</v>

89
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.450
<v Speaker 1>he became a loner at the age of 16 Napoleon began his military apprenticeship as</v>

90
00:03:53.451 --> 00:03:56.870
<v Speaker 1>a second left tenants training with the country's most elite itinerary.</v>

91
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Eunice.</v>

92
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.790
<v Speaker 1>He knows his trade well and developed into a skilled handler of arms as well as</v>

93
00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:03.230
<v Speaker 1>a capable Hendra of men.</v>

94
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

95
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the advancements that he had mapped out for himself was slow in coming.</v>

96
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>He soon realized that hard work and application,</v>

97
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.690
<v Speaker 1>we're not enough to forge a stellar military career position and money.</v>

98
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.260
<v Speaker 1>They also played their part and he had neither by his late teens.</v>

99
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon found himself in a state of frustrated inertia.</v>

100
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.180
<v Speaker 1>He knew that he was destined for great things,</v>

101
00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>yet nothing was happening for him.</v>

102
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Simply he was bored to death.</v>

103
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>What Napoleon needed was a cataclysmic event that would up ends the existing</v>

104
00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>order in presenting with the opportunity to grab hold of and shape the future.</v>

105
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Little did he know though that this was waiting just around the corner.</v>

106
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>On July the 14th 1789 Paris erupted and revolution the spark.</v>

107
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 1>There's unleashed the revolution in all its Furio card.</v>

108
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Speaker 1>When a crowd's took over,</v>

109
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 1>an armory called hotel to invalid,</v>

110
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>they grabbed its weapons and stormed the Bastille prison in search of powder and</v>

111
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>shot word spreads of the crown success ends.</v>

112
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Uprisings began all over France,</v>

113
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.510
<v Speaker 1>grand juries and manor houses.</v>

114
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.373
<v Speaker 1>They were overrun.</v>

115
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.600
<v Speaker 1>The country was in great turmoil.</v>

116
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.740
<v Speaker 1>20 year old Napoleon was far from Paris when revolution break forth cause they</v>

117
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>not to revolutionary himself.</v>

118
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>He welcomes the revolts which was shaking the system of privileges which he so</v>

119
00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:22.794
<v Speaker 1>despised.</v>

120
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.221
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

121
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:26.160
<v Speaker 1>it was this very system that prevented him from achieving the advancement of</v>

122
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 1>rank that he felt was due to him.</v>

123
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.030
<v Speaker 1>When the French republic was declared in the fall of 1792 v ambitious courses</v>

124
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

125
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to play a pass formulating a plan.</v>

126
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>He took a leave of absence from the army and returned to Corsica,</v>

127
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 1>which was now a part of France.</v>

128
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 1>He was intent on entering local politics and rising through the ranks until he</v>

129
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 1>could assert its influence on the national stage.</v>

130
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>The course it can.</v>

131
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Governor,</v>

132
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

133
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Rebuff Napoleon calling him a big inexperienced boy and Napoleon reacted to this</v>

134
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:55.470
<v Speaker 1>by setting up a power base to oppose the governor.</v>

135
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>He attracted a following of young cronies.</v>

136
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the establishment's proved too strong fan.</v>

137
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon was forced to flee to the mountains.</v>

138
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.291
<v Speaker 1>He ends.</v>

139
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>His entire family were labeled traitors and enemies of the father lands setting</v>

140
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.751
<v Speaker 1>south France.</v>

141
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>In June of 1793 Napoleon was tougher,</v>

142
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>more steely-eyed and more hard skinned as a result of his unhappy experience in</v>

143
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Corsica.</v>

144
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>The experience also caused a mental displacement.</v>

145
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>No longer a Corsican.</v>

146
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

147
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>he was now 30 French that France.</v>

148
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

149
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>while that was going to have to be molded to make it worthy of feminine,</v>

150
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.920
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't return to the army as an artillery caps him,</v>

151
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.150
<v Speaker 1>he was quickly ordered too,</v>

152
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:42.661
<v Speaker 1>too long.</v>

153
00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:46.020
<v Speaker 1>A city of 28,000 which had broken into open rebellion.</v>

154
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>This is dozens of this southern port.</v>

155
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It thrown their port,</v>

156
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.980
<v Speaker 1>open it to the British.</v>

157
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It was the French itineraries job to prevent the British from gaining a foothold</v>

158
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and just to subjugate the rebels.</v>

159
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.890
<v Speaker 1>The role of the ones that the British were defending the city from their ships,</v>

160
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:00.160
<v Speaker 1>cannons Napoleon,</v>

161
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.180
<v Speaker 1>and knew that he had been presented with the opportunity that could transform</v>

162
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:04.014
<v Speaker 1>his destiny.</v>

163
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Aristocratic officers had fled France leaving a vacuum that the Polian was all</v>

164
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.090
<v Speaker 1>too eager to fill.</v>

165
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.630
<v Speaker 1>All the had to do was simply proven itself on his commands.</v>

166
00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Guns and suppliers were rushed in from Provence and there's gunners were taught</v>

167
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>to Mandan.</v>

168
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.460
<v Speaker 1>The regular infantry were intensely retrains unto Bonaparte's direct</v>

169
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>supervision.</v>

170
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>He also began to display the flashes of charisma,</v>

171
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.180
<v Speaker 1>which would forge an unbreakable loyalty within his ranks.</v>

172
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>On December the 17th he personally led the assault of Fort Egg.</v>

173
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Relate his bravery and his cunning immediately apparent,</v>

174
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.310
<v Speaker 1>throwing himself into the fray.</v>

175
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.900
<v Speaker 1>He fought with fury.</v>

176
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most commanders,</v>

177
00:07:37.981 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon led from the front.</v>

178
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

179
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>horse was shot out from under him and it's an enemy ban at slashed him in the</v>

180
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

181
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

182
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.220
<v Speaker 1>he continued to attack and his forces quickly overcame the resistance.</v>

183
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.911
<v Speaker 1>Within hours,</v>

184
00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:51.270
<v Speaker 1>10 British ships had been destroyed and those that remained were in retreat.</v>

185
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.283
<v Speaker 1>The local people,</v>

186
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.460
<v Speaker 1>they would then subjugate us.</v>

187
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a stunning victory for Napoleon and one that led to his promotion to</v>

188
00:07:57.361 --> 00:07:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Brigadier General.</v>

189
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.550
<v Speaker 1>In the spring of 1795 Napoleon visited Paris has ambition burning brighter than</v>

190
00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:03.090
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

191
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.810
<v Speaker 1>While there he was charged with subjugating the parisien mobs by any means</v>

192
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

193
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.310
<v Speaker 1>He jumped at the opportunity grabbing cannons and muskets in order to equip is</v>

194
00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:12.390
<v Speaker 1>poorly armed forces.</v>

195
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.020
<v Speaker 1>He said his guns up inside the tutor Rian positions that made it impregnable.</v>

196
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.950
<v Speaker 1>When the attack came,</v>

197
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon commanded his men to unleash a merciless hail of fire upon them.</v>

198
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Waiting until he could see the whites of their eyes.</v>

199
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He sends a barrage of great shots that decimated the Parisien mob.</v>

200
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.380
<v Speaker 1>The enemy attacks us.</v>

201
00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:29.670
<v Speaker 1>We killed a great many of them.</v>

202
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.251
<v Speaker 1>Now we'll,</v>

203
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 1>there's quiet.</v>

204
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I could not be happier.</v>

205
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The podium wrote to his brother,</v>

206
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon was triumphant.</v>

207
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Within a month,</v>

208
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:39.600
<v Speaker 1>he had been made a full general I just 26 years of age.</v>

209
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>He was the commander of the army of the interior.</v>

210
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

211
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>As a reward for his success against the Parisien mobs was given command of the</v>

212
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>French army in Italy.</v>

213
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.560
<v Speaker 1>There he was charged with defeating France,</v>

214
00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>his enemies,</v>

215
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>the Austrians,</v>

216
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>along with that Italian allies to push them back over the Alps.</v>

217
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 1>This was his first opportunity to fight on foreign soil,</v>

218
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 1>and Napoleon was determined to capitalize on this.</v>

219
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Prior to his arrival,</v>

220
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's generals had already written him off as a new accounts upstart with</v>

221
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>illusions of grand.</v>

222
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Yet when Bonaparte's arrived in the flashes,</v>

223
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>generals quickly realized their mistake.</v>

224
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>They had vastly underestimated.</v>

225
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:23.214
<v Speaker 1>Then you Camada.</v>

226
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>He quickly put them in that place.</v>

227
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>For nearly two years,</v>

228
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>there in competence had seen the French forces stagnating in the Alps with</v>

229
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>nothing to show for it,</v>

230
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>but a general sense of apathy and discontent as the generals bit their lips.</v>

231
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon addressed the troops.</v>

232
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.351
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers,</v>

233
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you are naked and deal fed.</v>

234
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>No fame shines upon you.</v>

235
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I will lead you into the most fertile plains in the world.</v>

236
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Rich provinces and great city as well lie in your power.</v>

237
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You will find their honor,</v>

238
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>glory and riches.</v>

239
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>The men were enraptured by their new leader smiling and laughing in the midst.</v>

240
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It was unlike anything I had ever seen before.</v>

241
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>He picks up their spirits and made them believe in themselves and infusing them</v>

242
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:02.071
<v Speaker 1>with passion.</v>

243
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He began molding them into eight formidable fighting force.</v>

244
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:05.881
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

245
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>the other European powers had become very nervous about what was going on in</v>

246
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

247
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>The execution of their king and queen led to the fears that the French</v>

248
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 1>experiments in democracy would spreads am's threat and their own kingdoms.</v>

249
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>This led them to quickly move against the new French government.</v>

250
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>This led to a series of wars between France and most of the major European</v>

251
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>

252
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 1>the of built his army into the most efficient conquering force on the European</v>

253
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>mainland.</v>

254
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Over the next three years.</v>

255
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>He brought stunning victories,</v>

256
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:33.210
<v Speaker 1>not only in Italy,</v>

257
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 1>but as far as Australia and parts of North Africa.</v>

258
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a north African invasion force was actually moving it's Britain,</v>

259
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 1>which used Egypt as a trading route,</v>

260
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.400
<v Speaker 1>though he failed to bring Egypt under control,</v>

261
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon was greeted as a hero on,</v>

262
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 1>it's returned to Paris in 1799 yet he founds a nation in Tamale.</v>

263
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>The governments had no money.</v>

264
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>The Austrians and the Russians were threatening to invade and some people even</v>

265
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 1>wanted to bring back the royal family.</v>

266
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Rumors were flying of a cube with the people on the army behind him.</v>

267
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon at took charge of the grand assembly installing a new government that</v>

268
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>was to be headed by three provisional consults,</v>

269
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 1>one of these three men with Napoleon Bonaparte himself,</v>

270
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>and it was he who everyone knew was going to wield the power.</v>

271
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>

272
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon took control.</v>

273
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>He sidelined the other two consoles personally rewriting the constitution to</v>

274
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>make himself the first consult.</v>

275
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.050
<v Speaker 1>At 30 years of age,</v>

276
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon Bonaparte had risen from his humble Corsican backgrounds to become the</v>

277
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 1>most powerful</v>

278
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.600
<v Speaker 2>man in France</v>

279
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>as the absolute central power in France.</v>

280
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon had inherited a nation that had limped from one failed attempt to to</v>

281
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>replace the rule of monarchy to another.</v>

282
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 1>For many people,</v>

283
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>the conditions they found themselves in at the dawn of the 19th century were</v>

284
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>worse than before the revolution.</v>

285
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>They looked in Napoleon to save them from their dispatch.</v>

286
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>First though he had to save them from the Austrians.</v>

287
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 1>The Austrians had regrouped and gains back and most of the lands that Napoleon</v>

288
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>had secured during the Italian campaign,</v>

289
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>the arch Duke Francis.</v>

290
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 1>The second was intent on crushing the course that can use he thought he could do</v>

291
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:12.334
<v Speaker 1>as he pleased,</v>

292
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.241
<v Speaker 1>as was his custom.</v>

293
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:18.241
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon decided to take the offensive in the spring of 1800 he took his 40,000</v>

294
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>strong army across the French Alps.</v>

295
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a harrowing track,</v>

296
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 1>has men dragging field artillery and provisions up steep snow covered mountain</v>

297
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>rangers,</v>

298
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>which towers to a height of 10,500 feet.</v>

299
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Men Donnie's on reason and there's the grand army stumbled through this and</v>

300
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:33.034
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Pass.</v>

301
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 1>They were in a state of utter exhaustion,</v>

302
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>but the crossing it had made in just six days.</v>

303
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 1>The battle was joined on June the 14th and at the day's end,</v>

304
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>7,000 Frenchmen lay debt.</v>

305
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>The Austrians who would finally retreat in from the field of battle left 14,000</v>

306
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 1>bodies behind the totally spans grand army.</v>

307
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.133
<v Speaker 1>They had one again.</v>

308
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.190
<v Speaker 1>The Austrians withdrew and early the next year signed a peace treaty with</v>

309
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon.</v>

310
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain was the only country remaining in the podiums weight.</v>

311
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>He was simply the supreme ruler of the land mass that was Europe.</v>

312
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

313
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain has unquestioned command of the seas and fabulously Richard.</v>

314
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 1>This point due to how colonial conquest since boasting the greatest navy in the</v>

315
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 1>wells Briston decided it was time to holds the rise of the little general</v>

316
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>president declared war on France on May the 18th 1803 and it was at this point</v>

317
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:22.510
<v Speaker 1>in the Napoleon decided it was time to invade England,</v>

318
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.750
<v Speaker 1>displaying the laser like focus that epitomize the man.</v>

319
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>He stated,</v>

320
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 1>all my thoughts aren't directed towards England's.</v>

321
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I want only for a favorable winds.</v>

322
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Two plants,</v>

323
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 1>the Imperial Eagle on the Tower of London.</v>

324
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.961
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out though,</v>

325
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 1>the French invasion of Great Britain never materialized by September,</v>

326
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>1805 war with Austria.</v>

327
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Now fortified by the Russians was once again a priority.</v>

328
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 1>If the ground's army was being rushed from the coast,</v>

329
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 1>do the heart of the Austrian empire.</v>

330
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Then on October the 21st the Royal Navy,</v>

331
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:53.500
<v Speaker 1>it smashed the combined Spanish British fleet in the battle of Trafalgar,</v>

332
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>leaving the French essentially without a navy.</v>

333
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>The British that left them safe.</v>

334
00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 1>The now on December,</v>

335
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the second day's here for Napoleon had crowned himself as the first emperor of</v>

336
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the French in a lavish ceremony in all but name and place.</v>

337
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It was just lengthy coronation of the old kings,</v>

338
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>which with one telling difference,</v>

339
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon that you controller of his own fates,</v>

340
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>place the crown,</v>

341
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.800
<v Speaker 1>all 80 jewel encrusted pounds of it upon his own head.</v>

342
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.973
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

343
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 1>On December the second day,</v>

344
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:29.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>five Napoleon found himself again poised for Massell against Austria.</v>

346
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>This time,</v>

347
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>four to five by Russia,</v>

348
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 1>this would prove to be the little general,</v>

349
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>his greatest victory.</v>

350
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 1>He deliberately abandoned a strategic position near the town of Wooster in the</v>

351
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:42.064
<v Speaker 1>Austrian empire.</v>

352
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>So that his army,</v>

353
00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:46.060
<v Speaker 1>which numbered around 68,000 would appear vulnerable.</v>

354
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.700
<v Speaker 1>He then weakened his right flank,</v>

355
00:14:47.701 --> 00:14:51.970
<v Speaker 1>so it was to look the 90,000 strong flow into a trap if they their center open</v>

356
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>to counter attack and the pony and cut the line in two by 4:30 PM the allies</v>

357
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 1>were either dead or foreign retreat.</v>

358
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 1>The battlefields have simply fallen silent.</v>

359
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.070
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of Austerlitz just like that was over what it began as a great allied</v>

360
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to finally defeat and destroy.</v>

361
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon Bonaparte had ended not only in their defeat,</v>

362
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 1>but in catastrophe.</v>

363
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 1>The grounds victory at [inaudible] was followed up with a 21 day subjugation of</v>

364
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

365
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Over the next five years.</v>

366
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Victory followed victory as one by one.</v>

367
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 1>The European powers bowed to the dictates of Emperor Napoleon only at one</v>

368
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 1>European nation remains to be brought to heel.</v>

369
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.293
<v Speaker 1>Russia</v>

370
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is a colossal army across the Newman River run June the 24th 1812 to</v>

371
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 1>intimidate Russia,</v>

372
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out to be the undoing of his empire.</v>

373
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.570
<v Speaker 1>The Russians systematically retreated and scorched the earth,</v>

374
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 1>which drags the French deep into their territory.</v>

375
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Then when they did do battle,</v>

376
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.960
<v Speaker 1>it was the bloodiest day of Napoleon's Korea.</v>

377
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.160
<v Speaker 1>The French entered Moscow.</v>

378
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.060
<v Speaker 1>A week later,</v>

379
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I need to find it evacuated.</v>

380
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>The retreat ended up being even more costly.</v>

381
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers had insufficient clothing for the freezing temperatures of an early</v>

382
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Windsor disease,</v>

383
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 1>devastated the ranks and Russian forces pursued them all the way.</v>

384
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:16.030
<v Speaker 1>A little over a six of the 600,000 men who marched into Russia came home.</v>

385
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 1>This was a blow from which the little general would never recover by now for the</v>

386
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 1>political map of Europe,</v>

387
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it had changed the British,</v>

388
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:22.731
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish,</v>

389
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.800
<v Speaker 1>the Portuguese pushed the French Bac over the Pyrenees in dependency,</v>

390
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.710
<v Speaker 1>love walk.</v>

391
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 1>A grand coalition was formed with the decisive victory coming at the battle of</v>

392
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Leipzig in October of 1813 known as the battle of the nations that left 38,000</v>

393
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>French dead or wounded and 20 thousands captured.</v>

394
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

395
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon escapes only defines open hostility back in Paris.</v>

396
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.580
<v Speaker 1>The legislative assembly,</v>

397
00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:54.061
<v Speaker 1>the centers,</v>

398
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and even his own general stands on him.</v>

399
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.840
<v Speaker 1>He has no choice but to advocate,</v>

400
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.441
<v Speaker 1>which he did.</v>

401
00:16:58.441 --> 00:17:02.220
<v Speaker 1>So in April of [inaudible] 1814 it was agreed that Napoleon would be sent into</v>

402
00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:04.740
<v Speaker 1>exile on the Mediterranean island of Elba.</v>

403
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:05.950
<v Speaker 1>After 10 months of exome,</v>

404
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the Polian had had enough somehow on the night of February the 26th 1850 and he</v>

405
00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:13.710
<v Speaker 1>managed to sneak past his gods and set sail in a small boat for the mother</v>

406
00:17:13.711 --> 00:17:16.860
<v Speaker 1>country within a handful of loyal soldiers.</v>

407
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Miraculously,</v>

408
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.800
<v Speaker 1>they managed to avoid the British warships,</v>

409
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.630
<v Speaker 1>stepping foot back on French soil.</v>

410
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.470
<v Speaker 1>He fixed his sights on Paris and it's taking back what had been torn from</v>

411
00:17:25.471 --> 00:17:25.960
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>

412
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.880
<v Speaker 1>After six days in just few men were halted by an infantry regiments with strict</v>

413
00:17:29.881 --> 00:17:30.960
<v Speaker 1>orders to detain him,</v>

414
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.260
<v Speaker 1>the podium straight ahead of his followers and stood in their midst.</v>

415
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers either clouds if there is one among you who wants to kill his general</v>

416
00:17:38.731 --> 00:17:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and emperor.</v>

417
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:40.643
<v Speaker 1>Here I am.</v>

418
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.000
<v Speaker 1>His charisma that's done it again rather than rush to taken captive the massed</v>

419
00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:47.100
<v Speaker 1>infantry broken to wild applause.</v>

420
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Cheers of long live.</v>

421
00:17:48.541 --> 00:17:49.940
<v Speaker 1>The emperor filled the air.</v>

422
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly he had an army.</v>

423
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 1>As he closed it on Paris,</v>

424
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.090
<v Speaker 1>he drew more and more support in one place.</v>

425
00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Softer and other treats defected from the royal army and joined the rebel army,</v>

426
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.470
<v Speaker 1>the writing that it was on the wall.</v>

427
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>By the time you arrived in Paris,</v>

428
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 1>let me the 18th and flat.</v>

429
00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 1>The podium was back in command.</v>

430
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The people,</v>

431
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.420
<v Speaker 1>they welcomed him as a redeemed here,</v>

432
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.283
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

433
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.840
<v Speaker 1>across Europe.</v>

434
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.790
<v Speaker 1>The allies were in shock and disbelief.</v>

435
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:22.630
<v Speaker 1>The devil,</v>

436
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.860
<v Speaker 1>it had been unchanged.</v>

437
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.410
<v Speaker 1>They would have to unite one more time to stop him.</v>

438
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.483
<v Speaker 1>This time though,</v>

439
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.450
<v Speaker 1>they would have to totally destroy the man so that there was no chance he would</v>

440
00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:32.170
<v Speaker 1>come back.</v>

441
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon was declared an outlaw and a disturber of the tranquility of the wells.</v>

442
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.200
<v Speaker 1>They mask their armies for attack.</v>

443
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 1>The great reckoning it was that happens,</v>

444
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.420
<v Speaker 1>it would be delivered on a field of Rye and clover just outside of a small</v>

445
00:18:43.421 --> 00:18:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Belgian town called Waterloo.</v>

446
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 1>On June the 18th 72,000 French soldiers face day 68,000 strong allied force</v>

447
00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 1>under the Duke of Wellington.</v>

448
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.590
<v Speaker 1>While the fighting seemed even Napoleon made many tactical errors including</v>

449
00:18:56.591 --> 00:18:58.690
<v Speaker 1>launching his imperial guard too late.</v>

450
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's the most fatal error was to wait until midday before ordering his initial</v>

451
00:19:02.501 --> 00:19:03.010
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

452
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.960
<v Speaker 1>In order to the last of the muddy ground dry.</v>

453
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.300
<v Speaker 1>This gave the Prussians time do enter the fray.</v>

454
00:19:07.301 --> 00:19:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Later on,</v>

455
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.290
<v Speaker 1>they smash it against his right flank and the battle was lost.</v>

456
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Four days later,</v>

457
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon abdicated again,</v>

458
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but this time it would be no return.</v>

459
00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:20.770
<v Speaker 1>He was packed off to the remote British colony of Santa Elena at 46 Napoleon was</v>

460
00:19:20.771 --> 00:19:22.270
<v Speaker 1>simply a man without a future,</v>

461
00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.280
<v Speaker 1>the man of unstoppable ambition,</v>

462
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.210
<v Speaker 1>the man of action,</v>

463
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the amount of headlines he was confined to reading the newspaper and gardening.</v>

464
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:34.180
<v Speaker 1>He died on May the fifth 1821 most likely from stomach cancer days before when</v>

465
00:19:34.181 --> 00:19:35.200
<v Speaker 1>he knew his time was up,</v>

466
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.490
<v Speaker 1>he had whispered to to one of his gods to die is nothing but to live defeated</v>

467
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and without glory is to die every day.</v>
