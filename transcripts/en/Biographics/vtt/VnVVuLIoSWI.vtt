You're going to learn more about brilliant later in today's video,

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.660
but if you would like to learn more about the right now,

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.860
got a brilliant.org forward slash biographics who will also find a link in the

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.790
description below.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.110
<v 0>He is known as one of the most intelligent men to have walked the earth,</v>

8
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.900
yet his private life was nothing short of chaotic.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.220
He was the world's most celebrated scientist,
yet he shuns the limelight.

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
He ushered in the atomic age,
but he was a lifelong pacifist.

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.470
In this week's biographics,

12
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.190
we delve into the contradictory life of Albert Einstein.

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.540
Herman ends,
Pauline Einstein,
a Jewish couple,
married three years earlier,

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.010
welcomed their first child.

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.300
Albert's on March the 14th 1879 six weeks after his birth.

16
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.230
They moved from Ulm,

17
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:58.980
Germany to Munich as a result of failed business endeavors in Munich,

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.460
palm and joined forces with his brother and an electrical engineering business,

19
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.790
which was propped up by Pauline's parents.
Three years later,

20
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.920
they had their second child,
Maria,

21
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.620
with the influence of his musically talented mother.

22
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.820
Albert started musical studies at the age of five learning the piano is than the

23
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:15.570
violin.

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.200
Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age and Lisa roads.

25
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.820
If I were not a physicist,
I would probably be a musician.
I often think in music.

26
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.750
I live my daydreams in music.
I see my life in terms of music.

27
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.140
I get most joy in my life out of music.

28
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.120
He was enrolled in a Catholic school in 1885 switching over to the more advanced

29
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:41.121
Luitpold gymnasium in 1888 which is now known as the Albert Einstein Gen

30
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:45.750
nauseum.
He proved to be an adequate,
but by no means outstanding students.

31
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.310
By 1894 the electrical manufacturing business that Albert's father and uncle ran

32
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.170
was facing serious difficulty.

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.610
For the last decade there had been making DC current componentry,

34
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.580
but now ac current was gaining ascendancy and demand for their services as it

35
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:03.840
dried up with no income coming in home and decided to move the family to Italy

36
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.620
where job prospects looked a bit brighter.
However,
15 year old Albert,

37
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.440
he stayed behind to complete his schooling in Munich.

38
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.840
Albert did not enjoy your schooling and often butted head with the strict route

39
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.480
teachers.

40
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.710
He chafed at the strict discipline and the lack of freedom for any creative

41
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.750
thought.
The subjects that were taught to him,

42
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.220
they just held no interest for him except that was for mathematics.

43
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.820
He has a natural affinity for the subject and it's quickly mastered any work

44
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:30.780
that was presented to him.

45
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.510
From around the age of 12 I began teaching himself advanced mathematical
concept,

46
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:42.610
starting with Algebra.

47
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.680
His father engaged to tutor Max Talmud Ms. Soon Malbec was out thinking even him

48
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.460
tell him it's presented the boy with a geometry textbook.
He later commented.

49
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.990
Einstein had worked through the whole book.

50
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.780
He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics.

51
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.240
Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow

52
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.920
Einstein's dotted teaching in self calculus at age 12 and as a 14 year old,

53
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.340
he says that he had mastered integral and differential calculus.

54
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.850
Soon off to his family's moved to SLE,
Einstein forge a doctor's note,

55
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:16.960
which convinced the principal of the new pole gymnasium to allow him to quit

56
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.150
school and join his family in Italy.

57
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.710
He still had a year to go before completing is required schooling and it has

58
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.440
empty sky out of attending his last year of high school,

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.000
I took an entrance exam and the Swiss Federal Polytechnic University in Zurich.

60
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.970
He came out with excellent results in maths and physics,

61
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.660
but fails in every other subjects.
This school's in physics and math,
sweat,

62
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.630
so outstanding that they call it the eye of the school's principal.

63
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.830
He encouraged the family to sends Alba to the counties and school in Arou

64
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.270
Switzerland's in order to do increases knowledge.

65
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.900
It was arranged with the 17 year old just stay with the family of a professor of

66
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:53.440
the school,
Yoast villa during his year with the villas.

67
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.050
Elliot fell in love with Vince Ella's daughter,
17 year olds,
Marie Evans,

68
00:03:57.051 --> 00:03:58.120
a that they had a brief foray.

69
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.220
Man Switch came to an end when Marie moved to Oseberg jump Starter Teaching
Korea

70
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.430
having found his academic passion.

71
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:11.590
Now there's applied himself to his studies in Switzerland.

72
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.610
He passed the Swiss material with outstanding grades in physics and mathematics

73
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.970
and then reapplied to the Swiss Polytechnic University in Zurich.

74
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.690
This time he passed and was admitted into a four year physics and mathematics

75
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:23.920
teaching diploma program.

76
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.090
It was around this time that Albert also renounced his German citizenship in

77
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.930
order to avoid compulsory military training that would face him in a few months.

78
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:35.740
When he turned 18 Albert soon became friends with the only girl in his class,

79
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.470
Mileva marriage.
They both shared a love for science.

80
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.430
Being at the top of that class mean I spent a semester in Heidelberg,
Germany.

81
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.880
When she was away,
she and Einstein wrote to each other almost every day.

82
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.000
Once she returns their friendship at turned into a relationship.

83
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.930
Einstein's parents,
they oppose the union due to the difference in religion,

84
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.410
culture,
and age.
As the couple's relationship flourished.

85
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.520
Money that started to struggle with our studies in 1900 buying Stein pass the

86
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:03.070
final exam,
but Malave have failed afterwards.

87
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.580
She works at raising her knowledge so that she could retake the test.

88
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.460
It was around this time that she founds out,
but she was pregnant.

89
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.060
My mother decided to move in with their parents in early 19 oh zero she gave

90
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:14.830
birth to their daughter and I sell.

91
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.120
No one is sure what happened to my labor and Alvin's daughter with many thinking

92
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.940
that she was either adopted or died of scarlet fever.

93
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.970
I would struggle to find a teaching position following his graduation.

94
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.510
This was partly due to the fact that he had alienated many of his teachers over

95
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.540
the four years of his studies.
He gave off the impression that they had.

96
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.020
There's a lot of value to impart to him and he preferred to do his own

97
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.480
independent study.
He finally secured a job,

98
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:41.830
but it was one that was totally unrelated to his course of study and four by his

99
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:45.360
contemporaries to be below him.
Having gained his Swiss citizenship,

100
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.680
he became eligible to work for the Swiss government.

101
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.820
He secured a position working as a clerk and the Swiss Patent Office for

102
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:53.050
intellectual property.

103
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.840
Einstein's job was to assess patterns,
applications for all manner of devices.

104
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.230
Quite a number of the patent applications involved the transmission of

105
00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:11.520
electrical signals and the electromechanical synchronization of time.

106
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.290
These concepts jelled with Einstein's area of personal fascination and served as

107
00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:18.090
the impetus for his investigations,

108
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:22.740
exploring the nature of light and the relationship between space and time.

109
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.350
While his days were filled with patents applications,

110
00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:28.440
Einstein spent his evenings working on his scientific theories.

111
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.600
He started a discussion group with a few friends.

112
00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.970
Conrad Holbeck ends Maury solid vine.

113
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.230
He called this group the Olympia Academy Albert's Mla,

114
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.810
but they reunited in 1903 and they got married that same year.

115
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.890
The couple of wins on to have two sons Han's born in 1904 and Eduardo,

116
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.810
who arrived in 1910

117
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.090
1905 it was a turning point for appetite and Stein.

118
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.320
Over the last couple of years,

119
00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:59.710
he had been building our reputation as an up and coming intellect among the

120
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.730
scientific community.

121
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.380
In April of 1905 he completed his thesis in association with a professor of

122
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:08.170
experimental physics by the name of Alfred Kleiner.

123
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.190
Einstein received a phd from Zurich University.
Shortly thereafter,

124
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.390
during the second half of 1905 Albert produced for scientific papers.

125
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.260
The subjects of his dissertations were photo electric effect Brownie in motion,

126
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.770
special relativity and the equivalents of mass and energy.

127
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.760
Each of them was received and things he Astley by the intelligentsia.
However,

128
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.110
it was the fourth paper that gave the world its most famous equation.

129
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.590
E stands for energy,

130
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.650
m stands for mass and c squared for the speed of light multiplied by itself.

131
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.700
What it meant in practical terms was that mass could be changed into energy and

132
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:51.230
vice versa.
As a result,

133
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.400
tiny packets of mass could be converted into huge bursts of energy.

134
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.000
The 26 year old Einstein halves with the publication of his paper on the

135
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.840
equivalency of mass and energy,
it ushered in the atomic age.

136
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.920
Among those who heaped praise upon Einstein for his work was one of the most

137
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:11.660
preeminent quantum theorists of the day,
and that was max Planck from Germany.

138
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.240
His backing gave Albert instant credibility.

139
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.870
He began receiving speaking requests from all over Switzerland's along with

140
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.410
offers of teaching positions is day is at the patent office while they were

141
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:23.360
certainly over.

142
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.540
So this is a biography channel and we're not diving into the depths of

143
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:27.860
Einstein's work today,

144
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.670
but if you'd like to really get an understanding of just what he works on,

145
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.880
you should absolutely check out today's sponsor.
Brilliance.

146
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.970
Brilliance are science learning platform that allow you to learn through

147
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.490
something called active learning.
Basically to sum this up,

148
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.820
this is kind of the opposite of that feeling of reading a complex paragraph

149
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.360
about some principle and then just having no idea what's going on and then you

150
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:50.300
probably read it again and he was still don't have any idea what's going on.

151
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.620
Probably not just me.

152
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:54.980
It's kind of just that inability to absorb complex information.

153
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.710
It's totally normal.
It's also totally not the best way to learn.
Brilliant.

154
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.370
Take even something like special relativity and make it easy to understand.

155
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.300
They give you something super short to read and then you immediately apply that

156
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:10.080
to a problem and just a rinse and repeat and suddenly are understanding all

157
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:12.840
sorts of crazy stuff that you didn't think you'd ever understands.

158
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.630
I've used brilliant and I think you should just go and try it out to see how

159
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:20.010
fascinating it is that you can learn a complex subject so quickly and easily.

160
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.770
It's just remarkable how quickly you can grasp something,

161
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.690
whether you want to learn about paradoxes in space,

162
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:26.880
time in that place in special relativity.

163
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.390
Useful for today's video or maybe something completely different like advanced

164
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:32.790
stats.
Well,
brilliant is why you should do it.

166
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.340
let's get back to Einstein,
shall we?

167
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.120
Einstein worked the lecture circuit and then took up a position as a lecturer at

168
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.120
the University of Bern in 1908 during that year,

169
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.000
he also returned to his Alma Mater,
the University of Zurich.

170
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.090
The university authorities was like taken with the budding genius that they

171
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:01.440
created a position just for him as an associate professor in the theoretical

172
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:02.310
physics departments.

173
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.840
He transferred there from Burn University in 1909 two years later.

174
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.690
Einstein gains a full professorship when he took up the position that the

175
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.980
Charles Virgin and university in Prague to take up the position he had to take

176
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:15.510
out Australian citizenship,

177
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.480
but as he would only remain in the position for 12 months.
Over that time,

178
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:21.210
he published a total of 11 scientific papers.

179
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.780
Then in 1912 he returned to the University of Zurich where he took,

180
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:27.540
I'll pay full professorship and the theoretical physics department.

181
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.200
He was able to work alongside his longtime friend and collaborator,

182
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.280
Marcel Grossmann,

183
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.300
as well as teaching the laws of thermodynamics and also lectured on analytical

184
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:37.720
mechanics.
That's in year.

185
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.730
Einstein began an extra marital affair with his first cousin,
said love,

186
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:45.780
and Tal Einstein was not really there much for his family all of his time and

187
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.270
energy into his work and research.
For several years,

188
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.550
he had been emotionally distant from his wife.

189
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.450
Recently letters were found that he wrote in 1910 to his first love Marie Vinzel

190
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.291
lab in them,

191
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.070
he professed his undying love for her and lamented the life that they had missed

192
00:10:59.071 --> 00:10:59.904
out on together

193
00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.070
in 1914 Einstein,
I breach it his family yet again,

194
00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:12.610
and it took up a position at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics located at

195
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.110
the University of Berlin.

196
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.350
He would remain in Germany for the next 19 years and we're soon appointed

197
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.640
director of the institute.

198
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.370
The position gave him professorship without teaching duties,

199
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:25.510
which afforded him time to work on his scientific studies and other major draw

200
00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:29.380
for the return to Germany was that it allowed him to be closer to his mistress

201
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.220
[inaudible] towards the end of 1914 believe that moved back to Zurich with her

202
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.570
sons.
After finding out about her husband's affair,

203
00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:39.790
it's coming to the realization that Albert was not capable of being a family
man.

204
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.290
Einstein divorcement over in April of 1919 then in June,

205
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.340
he married his cousin in 1960 and Einstein published his theory of general

206
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.940
relativity.
This was a groundbreaking achievement in the world of physics.

207
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.320
It's theorized that what we see as the force of gravity actually results from

208
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:59.310
the curvature of space and time.
As a result,

209
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.440
the earth is not actually being pulled towards the sun by gravity,

210
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.650
but rather by the interaction of space and time,

211
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.780
which dictates how LVF moves.

212
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.130
Einstein predicted that lights from another star would be Ben spine,

213
00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:14.950
the sun's gravity during a solar eclipse in 1919 that prediction,

214
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.700
it was confirmed the publicity that surrounded the confirmation of this theory

215
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:22.570
is went around the globe and for the first time the name Albert Einstein,

216
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.370
it became internationally known.

217
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.273
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

218
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.710
<v 0>and the only 1920s Einstein became a celebrity among the scientific community in</v>

219
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:36.690
America.
He was invited to New York,

220
00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:41.430
so kick off a three week lecture tour in April of 1921 he lectured at Columbia

221
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.680
and Princeton among other places of learning.

222
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.330
He also managed to get in and they tore off the White House.

223
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.260
Einstein's first impression of America was the positive one.

224
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.460
Shortly after his return,

225
00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:54.170
he published an essay called my first impressions of America and dinettes.

226
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.500
He wrote what strikes a visitor is the joyous,
positive attitude to life.

227
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.000
The American is friendly,
self confidence,
optimistic and without envy.

228
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.520
In 1921 Einstein's popularity,

229
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.790
it reached a new high when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics because

230
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.740
there's theories on general and special relativity were not yet widely accepted.

231
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.720
This award was given for his explanation of the photo electric effect throughout

232
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:22.530
the 1920s Albertson Nelson and undertook a number of international tours that

233
00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:26.340
saw them being received in such far flung places as Singapore or Japan in

234
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:30.600
Palestine and December of 1930 he made a second trip to the United States.

235
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.270
This time he wanted to fly under the radar feeling that he had received a far

236
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:37.440
too much attention on his first visit.
That's tries.
He me,

237
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:42.210
he still found himself being overwhelmed with offers to speak and invitations to

238
00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:45.480
receive awards.
All of them.
He turned down.
However,

239
00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.340
when he tried to slip into New York City,

240
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.460
he couldn't avoid the celebrity of being awarded the keys to the city by Mayor

241
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.570
Jim Walker.
When he visited the New York Riverside Church.

242
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:58.590
He was surprised to find that the congregants that created a life size statue of

243
00:13:58.591 --> 00:14:02.340
him.
He then moved on to California where he was introduced to a number of movie

244
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.700
stars and Pleading Charlie Chaplin.
These two men,

245
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.100
the actually remained lifelong friends.
On one occasion,

246
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.730
chaplain and Einstein appeared together in public to great applause at that

247
00:14:11.731 --> 00:14:13.680
binds Einstein turn to chaplain and said,

248
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.010
they are sharing us both to this chaplain replied,

249
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.340
they're applauding you because none of them understands you and applauding me

250
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.380
because everybody understands me.

251
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.200
Back in Germany,
things were beginning to look rather ominous.

252
00:14:31.201 --> 00:14:34.710
With the rise of the Nazi party,
the rights of Jews,
they rapidly diminished.

253
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.110
They were no longer permitted to hold positions of authority,

254
00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:41.250
so Einstein was removed from his directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.

255
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.710
Despite being the most famous scientist on the planet,

256
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.010
he couldn't even teach in the local secondary school while he was on his

257
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:51.470
overseas tours is home,
was raided by the Gestapo.
In February,

258
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.380
1933 Einstein was on another tour of the United States with Elsa.

259
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.340
Without off Hitler having been proclaimed chancellor of Germany just a few weeks

260
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.520
earlier.

261
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.210
Albert's knew that there was no future for him and the country of his birth,

262
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.780
the couple of sale to Belgium and March.
Upon arrival in Antwerp,

263
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.650
Einstein went directly to the German consulate and renounced his German

264
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:11.210
citizenship than Nazis.

265
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.990
Later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler youth camp.

266
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.320
The Einstein's rented a house in Dawn,
Belgium for a couple of months.

267
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.440
During that time,
news of the Nazi book burnings reached them.

268
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.920
It was reported that all of our butts writings had been consumed in the flames.

269
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.060
A German magazine published the list of enemies of the state and it included

270
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.930
Einstein alongside his name was the caption,
not yet hang,

271
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.240
offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.

272
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.980
In July of 1933 nine stone was invited to London for six weeks at the request of

273
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.630
an old British naval officer friends.

274
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.420
While there he had an audience with Winston Churchill,

275
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.990
he asked for British assistance to bring as many Jewish scientists sounds of

276
00:15:47.991 --> 00:15:51.110
Germany as possible.
Giotto was immediately receptive.

277
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.760
Over the coming is Einstein used his influence to arrange for placements of more

278
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.970
than a thousand scientists and teaching positions at universities outside of

279
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:00.650
Germany on his returns and Belgium.

280
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:04.250
Einstein was offered a resident's scholarship at Princeton University in October

281
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:07.820
of 1933 he ends,
Elsa sailed again for the United States.

282
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.050
Einstein took up the position to Princeton University and the Institute for

283
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.260
Advanced Study in 1935 he was granted permanent residency in America.

284
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:20.240
He got his US citizenship in 1940 and 1935 and new tribulation arose.

285
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.470
Feinstein,
his wife Elsa,
was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems.

286
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.880
The following.
Yeah,
sadly she died.
This was to be his biggest trial yet it's now.

287
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.160
Einstein was not one to show his emotions,

288
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:35.150
but it was said by a friend's pita Bucky that he shed a tear off dialysis

289
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:37.040
passing.
This might not sound like much,

290
00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:40.730
but throughout that whole friendship he had never once seen outlet to cry.

291
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.060
In 1939 a couple of young Hungarian scientist named Leo Szilard and Eugene Vigna

292
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.040
discovered the science behind the atomic bomb.

293
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.880
They tried to informing those in positions of power,
but they had no influence,

294
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:00.170
so they were just ignored.

295
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.980
Then they decided to reach out to someone who would have credibility with those

296
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.790
in high power.
That's we spend,
they contacted Albert Einstein,

297
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.300
said Landon Vigna explained their theory to Einstein and he was quick to

298
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:12.410
understand the concepts,

299
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.130
so wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein signature on it.

300
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.630
The letter urged America to create the first atomic bomb before Germany did.

301
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.170
It is generally agreed that the addition of Einstein's signature was a key

302
00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:28.040
influencer and President Roosevelt's adoption of the atomic bomb development

303
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:30.680
projects that was known as the Manhattan project.

304
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.750
The u s government launched a Manhattan project in December of 1941 amazingly,

305
00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:39.020
Einstein's application to be a part of the project was turned down.

306
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.080
The reason for this was simply that he was a German and people were worried that

307
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:43.520
he might be a spy for the Nazis.

308
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.170
On August the sixth and August the ninth 1945 the atomic bomb was used on the

309
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:49.040
Japanese cities,

310
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.030
Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing at least 129,000 people.

311
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.680
Five months prior to his death.

312
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.550
Abbott said that his greatest mistake in life with signing that letter to

313
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:02.550
President Roosevelt concerning the atomic bomb,

314
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.750
he stated I made one great mistake in my life when I signed the letter to

315
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:10.320
President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made,

316
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.700
but there was some justification,
the danger that the Germans would make them.

317
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.480
Einstein was never comfortable about his fame.
He once said in the past,

318
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:28.020
it never occurred to me that every casual remark of mine would be snatched up

319
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:32.130
and record it otherwise I would have crept further into my shell by the time

320
00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:34.140
that he was settled into his life in America.
However,

321
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:38.250
he realized that he was able to use this celebrity status as a vehicle toward

322
00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.810
promoting important causes.

323
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.440
Einstein had been a lifelong pacifist and humanitarian.

324
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.880
Now he used his platform to bring these causes to the fall.

325
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.550
During the 1940 [inaudible] gave his support to the cause of civil rights in the

326
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:54.630
United States.
He considered racism to be the worst disease in America.

327
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.010
He joins the National Association for the advancement of colored people and a CP

328
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.520
and it became friendly with civil rights activists to w E.
B.
Du Bois.

329
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.900
When du Bois was arrested in 1951 Einstein's offered to be a character witness

330
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.430
was enough to get the case dismissed.

331
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.330
In 1946 he was awarded an honorary degree from Lincoln University in

332
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:16.740
Pennsylvania,
which was the first in America to award degrees to black students.

333
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.510
He sold that racism in America was handed down from one generation to the next.

334
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.970
Einstein also spoke out against antisemitism.

335
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.880
He developed a friendship with the first prime minister of the new state of

336
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:28.410
Israel,
David,
Ben Gurion,

337
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.170
regarding prejudice against Jews in various parts of the world.

338
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.110
He said there are no German Jews.
There are no Russian Jews.

339
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:38.370
There are no American Jews.
There are in fact only Jews.

340
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.880
He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with the actions of

341
00:19:48.881 --> 00:19:50.380
humans.
He did say,
however,

342
00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:55.310
that I am not an atheist preferring to call himself an agnostic when boss,

343
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.550
if he believed in an afterlife.
Einstein quips.

344
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.420
No one life is enough for me and that life,

345
00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:02.920
it would end on the 17th of April,

346
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:07.750
1955 at the age of 76 he had been suffering from internal bleeding caused by the

347
00:20:07.751 --> 00:20:09.970
rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm,

348
00:20:09.971 --> 00:20:12.490
which should previously been reinforced surgically.

349
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.430
The night before his passing at Princeton Hospital when offered surgery,

350
00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:17.680
Einstein said,
I want to go when I,

351
00:20:17.681 --> 00:20:21.670
once it is tasteless to prolong life artificially.
I've done my share.

352
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.490
It is time to go.
I will do it elegantly.

353
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.110
In a memorial lecture in 1965 nuclear physicist Jay Robert Oppenheimer

354
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.510
summarized his impression of Einstein as such,

355
00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:36.220
he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without wealthiness.

356
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:40.030
There was always with him a wonderful purity at once.
Childlike,

357
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.870
and it's profoundly stubborn is I really hope you found that video.
Interesting.
