1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.720
John F.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.560
Kennedy served as the 35th president of the United States before he was killed

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.890
in 1963 while we all know about JFK,

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.880
chances are that you probably know more about the conspiracy theory surrounding

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.630
his assassination then the actual details of his life.

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.500
This story goes far deeper than just the individual life of John F.
Kennedy.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.030
In order to understand the man you need to know the family and how he was far

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:27.850
from the only one whose life ended in tragedy.
On today's biographics,

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.740
we will discuss the real man who was behind the presidency.

10
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.460
The Kennedys have been called American royalty and to the outside world.

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.440
They were a symbol of the American dream.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.680
It all started when Patrick Kennedy married Bridget Murphy,

13
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:56.910
who emigrated from Ireland to the United States in the 18 hundreds Patrick died

14
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.670
at an early age leaving Bridget,
a widow and a single mother.

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.170
She became a full time maid for a wealthy family in Boston.
After a few years,

16
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.770
though,
Bridget Kennedy managed to save her money and opens up in general store.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.240
Her only son,
Patrick Junior,

18
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.350
was called PJ and at 14 years old he started working in the general store with

19
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.500
his mother.
When he was in his twenties PJ opens an Irish pub.

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.070
He made so much money that he purchased a bar in an upscale hotel as well as the

21
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.710
local bank,
Bj's son,
Joseph P.

22
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.620
Kennedy would be the first to grow up enjoying the fruits of his ancestors
labor.

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.560
He went to Harvard University where he got a taste of high society.

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.550
Unfortunately though,

25
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.330
Joseph was snubbed by a lot of his classmates and denied from answering several

26
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.580
fatalities.
While it's hard to imagine now,

27
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.150
there was actually a huge stigma against Irish Catholics back then,

28
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.010
especially among the American elite.

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.860
Most of the upper class American families were descended from British

30
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.250
Protestants who taught their children that the Irish were low class,

31
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.470
good for nothing.
Drugs this stereotype,

32
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.210
it motivated Joseph Kennedy to become a millionaire and prove everybody wrong.

33
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.020
Joseph Kennedy married the Mayor of Boston's daughter,
Rose Fitzgerald.

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.970
They went on to have nine children together.

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.120
The oldest son was named a juicy of junior runs.
Even as an infant.

36
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.200
His parents would say that he would grow up to be the presidents of the United

37
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.100
States.
His second son,

38
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.750
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May the 29th of 1917 but everyone called him

39
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.920
Jack Rose.

40
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
We'd go on to have seven more children and they all grew up watching their

41
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:21.981
father work hard to make his first million before the age of 35 in the 1920s

42
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:25.980
Joseph Kennedy was hustling to make as much money as he could by any means

43
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.640
necessary.

44
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.270
You took advantage of prohibition by buying of the alcohol just before the laws

45
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:34.020
were scheduled to change.
He ran speakeasies with a man named Sam g and Connor,

46
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.880
who was connected to the Chicago mob.

47
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.210
He also played the stock markets and made millions running schemes that would

48
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.760
now be considered rather illegal.
Before long,

49
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.660
Joseph Kennedy became the richest Irish Catholic in the United States.

50
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.410
Since he was always trying to climb the ladder for more money and more power

51
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.620
dress of Kennedy began to get involved in politics.
President.

52
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:56.310
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was impressed when Kennedy's Wyss and charisma,

53
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:00.040
and so it was appointed as the ambassador to Great Britain considering that he

54
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.580
had spent his entire life trying to prove that Irish men could be just as

55
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:04.870
successful as the English.

56
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
This was the cherry on top of Kennedy's achievements and the only way it could

57
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.030
get any better was if one of his sons became the president

58
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.450
and Andy was an adorable baby with big blue eyes.

59
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.380
But even during his earliest days in life,
he was already very sick.

60
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.150
By the age of three,
he had had whooping cough,

61
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.430
chicken pox or measles and scarlet fever.

62
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.420
Jack was also diagnosed with a condition called Addison's disease.
Indeed,

63
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.450
because of all of this,
you spent a lot of his young life living in the hospital.

64
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.950
His parents,
they were told by doctors that he may not survive to adult it.

65
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.710
However,
Jack was a very happy kid since he handled a lot of love for life.

66
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.490
Friends and relatives say that he never complained about his illnesses and that

67
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.980
he was always smiling and always making checks.

68
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.580
His siblings made light of his condition.
Joking that if a mosquito bit him,

69
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.010
he would die instantly.
The good of the children,

70
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.980
they grew up meeting members of the British aristocracy from a young age,

71
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.740
so they were taught traditional attic cabs.

72
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.620
They became this uniquely all American family who had the charm of British

73
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:08.680
royalty while most of the children were living with their father in London.

74
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:12.640
Both Jack and his older brother Joe Jr attended a private high school called

75
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.950
Choate,
Rosemary Hall in Connecticut.

76
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.820
Joe Junior was the most popular guy in school and the all around the golden boy.

77
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.250
He was a varsity football player who was good looking,

78
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.670
outgoing and charismatic and got straight A's.
Jack,
on the other hand,

79
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.570
was the polar opposite of his older brother because of his disease.

80
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:30.400
He grew up feeling as if every day might be as lost,

81
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:32.620
so he was constantly living life to the fullest.

82
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.450
He got cs in every subject except English and history,
just like his father.

83
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.630
Jack got some backlash from his peers for being Irish.

84
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.110
Some of the other kids called him market because that was the nickname given to

85
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:47.950
Irish man who would clean up the horse manure in the stables and English navels

86
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.940
instead of sulking.

87
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.200
Jack countered the bullies by embracing the name is even proudly wore a necklace

88
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:54.850
with a gold shovel.
Chogm.

89
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.510
He created a group on campus called the market's club and they dedicated their

90
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:02.440
free time to playing crazy pranks around campus.
Soon enough being a marker.

91
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:05.620
It wasn't a derogatory term anymore.
It was a badge of honor.

92
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.620
Some of the most popular boys in the school joined his clubs so that they could

93
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.560
raise hell.
If Youtube had existed back then,

94
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.740
there is no doubt that they would be filming these pranks and putting them on

95
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.820
the platform.
In fact,

96
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.190
Kennedy was planning a prank where they'd bring in a huge amount of manure ends

97
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:22.300
in the middle of the school's dance floor and take photographs of the students

98
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.580
and teachers reactions when they opened the doors.

99
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.170
When the Dean caught wind of this plan,

100
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:28.750
he called in Joseph Kennedy for a parent teacher conference.

101
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.550
Jack was nearly kicked out of school,

102
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:34.030
but his father stepped in and prevented him from being expelled with a wink and

103
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:34.571
a smile.

104
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:38.050
Jason Senior was teaching Jack that he didn't have to play by the rules that

105
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:42.250
normal people played by the Kennedy's.
They were always able to pay someone off.

106
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.260
Unfortunately,
Jack's recklessness,

107
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.140
it would catch up to him when he became seriously injured during a football
game.

108
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.710
He ruptured a disc in his back and it took months of surgeries and time in the

109
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:52.930
hospital before he could even walk again.

110
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.620
He never fully recovered and to be in pain for the rest of his life.

111
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.240
After graduating from high school,

112
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.290
Jaquinta Harvard bound side of pass see joins the swimming and sailing teams and

113
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.790
was known for being a ladies' man.

114
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.710
Even though he had a passion for English literature,

115
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.740
his father pushed him to study political science and law.

116
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.480
He also arranged for him and his older brother,

117
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.420
Joe Junior to get summer jobs in the American embassy in London.

118
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.351
Jack and his father.

119
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:24.100
They would send letters back and forth about politics and when World War Two

120
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:27.490
began,
he already had plenty of insight and knowledge about what was going on in

121
00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:31.740
Europe.
For his senior thesis,
Jack wrote a book called why England slabs,

122
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.460
which basically reiterated his father's beliefs about how he believed Great

123
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.620
Britain was not prepared for World War II.
It became a best seller in,

124
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:43.540
did establish the name John F.
Kennedy as a political expert at an early age.

125
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.080
While Jack was finishing up his degree at Harvard,
his father,
Joseph Kennedy,
Sr,

126
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.710
was dealing with the very real possibility that the United States would join in

127
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.200
World War II even though he was living in London at the time.

128
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.680
Joseph Kennedy made it very clear that he was an isolationist,

129
00:06:56.681 --> 00:06:59.290
which meant that he did not want Americans to join the war.

130
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.160
And in 1940 he made a comment in the press that he believed that he could

131
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:06.340
negotiate a peace treaty without off Hitler because of the statements.

132
00:07:06.341 --> 00:07:10.450
People assumes that he was a Nazi sympathizer and he was forced to step down as

133
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:14.230
the ambassador Jack and his older brother Joe Jr both wanted to join the navy

134
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:18.280
after the United States officially entered World War Two in 1941 when Jack went

135
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.670
through the medical examination,
he was rejected because of his past back injury.

136
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.210
His father,
however,
paid off the army officials and they let him pass through.

137
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.880
Joe Junior went on to become a pilot in Europe.
Well,

138
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.070
Jack worked as the commander of a torpedo,

139
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.810
but in the South Pacific called PD one oh nine his back was in near constant

140
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:38.230
pain,
but he always suffered in silence,
swimming and sailing.

141
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.350
Every summer it paid off for Jack and a huge way because during the war,

142
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:44.290
PT 109 was attacked by the Japanese and it began to sink.

143
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.600
He spent three hours swimming around the rackage,

144
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.870
making sure that he had accounted for all of the survivors.
One of the men,

145
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.830
Patrick McMahon,
was badly burned all over his body and he could hardly move.

146
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.500
Kennedy was the strongest swimmer of the group.
So yeah,

147
00:07:56.501 --> 00:08:00.430
to tow Patrick McMahon by pulling a string from his life jacket with his teeth,

148
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.840
he let his men as they swam three miles to a nearby island to safety and they

149
00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:07.930
were rescued.
A week later when Jack returned home,

150
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.260
he weighed any 120 pounds and he was in excruciating pain cans,

151
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.440
wear a back brace and walk with a cane.

152
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:18.460
For several months he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps metal for a service.

153
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.730
The entire family celebrated his bravery by throwing him a party.

154
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.280
Jack's older brother Joe Jr came home for the party,

155
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:28.420
but he felt a deep sense of shame because he never did anything to prove that he

156
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:31.240
was a war hero and it just happens to be like his younger brother Joe.

157
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.810
He accepted an extremely dangerous mission to carry heat sensitive explosives

158
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:37.210
and a plane boss before he could complete the mission,

159
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.220
the plane exploded in midair.
Joseph Kennedy Jr died at just 29 years old.

160
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.400
Jack Kennedy never wanted to be presidents of the United States.

161
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:54.700
He was very much a free spirit and he wasn't suited for politics.

162
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.350
He always that he wants it to be a writer who sailed around the world,

163
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.090
but now that Joe Jr was gone,

164
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:04.230
his father turned to Jack to fulfill all of his hopes and dreams even though he

165
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.120
didn't have very much experience in politics.

166
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:10.620
His father used as money and connections to propel JFK of case Korea supported

167
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.401
by their father,

168
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.800
has siblings pitched in by spending a lot of their time running Jack's campaign

169
00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:18.690
as their full time job through his late twenties and early thirties he quickly

170
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.540
moved up the House of Representatives and then the Senate.

171
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.240
In 1953 John Kennedy married Jacqueline Bouvier.
She was a young social license,

172
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.980
a riser at the Washington time.
Harold,
just the like Jack.

173
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.250
She had also been groomed by how wealthy east coast family to be the perfect

174
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:35.490
first lady.
She could speak French,
Italian and Spanish fluently,

175
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.460
which ages later on in international diplomacy.

176
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.630
Soon after Marian Jacqueline JFK wrote his second book called profiles of

177
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.030
courage,
which won him the Pulitzer Prize.

178
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.070
In 1960 JFK became the Democratic nominee for the presidency when he was just 43

179
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:50.730
years old.

180
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.570
The public love to Jack Kennedy because he seems like any other normal guy.

181
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.050
He spoke with a Boston accents and he wasn't afraid to visit the factories and

182
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.650
shake the hands of the average American even though he came from a wealthy

183
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.620
family,
people knew that the Kennedys was self made and sold,

184
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.940
that he was very down to earth.

185
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.200
Young voters of the 1960s they were eager for change and he represented the

186
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:11.100
ideal American.

187
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.880
When he moved to the White House in 1961 jack placed his younger brother Bobby

188
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.240
as the new attorney general.
Even though he was only 35 years old,

189
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.280
the media was obsessed with the Kennedys.

190
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.570
Jackie would appear in magazines showing off our interior design skills at the

191
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.930
White House and it's a French fashion was always front page news.
Well,

192
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:30.840
they didn't know is the behind the scenes.
She was his rock.

193
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.230
She would help him by translating foreign books and documents all through the

194
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:37.530
night while also giving them a place to call home outside of work.

195
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.600
He loved spending time with his two children.

196
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.680
John Jr and Karen and Fred said that the oval office was always filled with the

197
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:47.580
kids' toys and the first thing he did every morning was watched cartoons and eat

198
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.970
cereal with them.
Despite having such a beautiful young family,

199
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:53.820
JFK was known for having not so secret affairs.

200
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.670
Raymond speculated that he was dating the buxom movie star,

201
00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.390
Marilyn Monro and and phone records prove that she frequently called the White

202
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.950
House,
but for all of this secret fas,

203
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.330
Jackie never strayed from a loyalty she knew about his infidelity and considered

204
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:07.111
getting a divorce,

205
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:10.500
but chose to stay together for the sake of Jack's political career.

206
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.580
In later interviews,

207
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:15.570
Jackie said that Jack never stopped appreciating the fact that they were lucky

208
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.740
enough to live in the White House.

209
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.370
She described it as constantly feeling like a kid on Christmas because they were

210
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:22.560
always gushing over the history that surrounded them.

211
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.720
They never took a moment for granted.
The Kennedys,

212
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.510
youthful enthusiasm is often credited for pushing America through the space
race,

213
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:31.560
and Jeff k helped to bring America to the noon.

214
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.070
John gave the impression that he genuinely enjoyed his job as presidents.

215
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.340
He was known for smiling in the middle of a question from a journalist because

216
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.320
it already thought of what he come back.

217
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.160
He treated his press conferences almost like they were an audience for jokes

218
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:45.480
that he was writing in his spare time.

219
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.600
One day he was holding a piece of paper as if it was about to say something

220
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:51.420
incredibly serious to the crowd.
He then looked up and said

221
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.823
in space,
uh,

222
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.360
<v 3>took off at 10 oh eight.
He reports that everything is perfect and working well.</v>

223
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.370
<v 0>He smiles in the room,
burst out in laughter</v>

224
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.010
even though he was always smiling for the press.
John F.

225
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.110
Kennedy was an expert at hiding his pain.

226
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.800
He has been credited for saving the United States from the Cuban missile crisis

227
00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:18.860
and preventing nuclear war during the Eisenhower Administration.

228
00:12:18.861 --> 00:12:22.820
The CIA was planning to invade Cuba to bring down the communist leader Fidel

229
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:22.910
Castro.

230
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.990
When JFK was sworn into office in January of 1961 he was briefed on the plan

231
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.890
that was already underway.
This was the famous mission known as the Bay of Pigs,

232
00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:34.640
and unfortunately it was not a failure.
After this,
Fidel Castro,

233
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:38.330
Captain American soldiers and threads in the United States with a nuclear bombs.

234
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.950
After a series of negotiations,

235
00:12:39.951 --> 00:12:44.630
Kennedy agreed to send $53 million in baby food and medication to Cuba in

236
00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:46.910
exchange for the lives of the American prisoners.

237
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.400
By notice 60 to the threats of nuclear war.

238
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.610
It's subsided and a collection of interviews called the Jackie Kennedy tapes.

239
00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:56.300
We learned that it was terrifying for the young couple to and to office and

240
00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.470
immediately have such a huge burden on their shoulders during the Cuban missile

241
00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:00.860
crisis.

242
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.310
JFK was so upset about the possibility of nuclear war that he hardly slept and

243
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.460
one day simply bled into the next.

244
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.340
She also said that they had a conversation about what to do in the case of an

245
00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:13.340
attack.
Jacqueline was more than willing to die with Jack.

246
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.580
She said that if there was not enough time to get to the bunker,

247
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.760
she would stand beside him on the White House lawn to watch the world.

248
00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:24.320
And Jack Kennedy truly did care for the American people and he loved them even

249
00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:26.930
if he didn't know them personally.
His wife,
Jackie,

250
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.040
said that he would often come home sobbing whenever he had any tragic news of

251
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:34.430
Americans dying.
You had first hand experience serving in World War II,

252
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.060
so the last thing he wanted was for the United States to get involved in the

253
00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:41.870
Vietnam War.
The media accused him of being soft on communism,

254
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.980
but he was firm on his decision.
If he was still alive to complete a second time,

255
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:50.981
there is a very real possibility that the 58,220 Americans who died in Vietnam

256
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.590
would have never met that fate bus.
As we all know,

257
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.220
Lyndon B Johnson declared war on Vietnam in 1964

258
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.183
<v 4>yeah.</v>

259
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.430
<v 0>On November the 22nd 1963 John F.</v>

260
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.880
Kennedy and his presidential motorcade was driving through the streets of
Dallas,

261
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:10.540
Texas.

262
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.350
Jack was waving to the crowd and sickening next to his wife Jackie in the back

263
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:17.170
of the 1961 Lincoln continental,
the governor of Texas,

264
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:20.590
John Connolly and his wife were sitting in front of them just as they were

265
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.370
passing the Texas school book depository.
At least three shots were fired.

266
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.340
Jack was hit in the neck and the next was the fatal head shot.

267
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.130
At least one of the bullets I'll say had cannoli,
John F.
Kennedy.

268
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.670
He was pronounced dead and vice president Lyndon B Johnson assumed the role of

269
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:37.150
president of the United States,
the entire country.
It was stunned.

270
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.770
Everyone who was alive back then remembers exactly where they were when Jack

271
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.780
Kennedy was killed and the entire nation.

272
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.690
More at that president's a man named Abraham is approved.

273
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:49.930
It was in the crowd during the attack and he filmed the parade with his eight

274
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.570
millimeter camera.
He not the only one filming that day,

275
00:14:52.571 --> 00:14:56.240
but he captured the clearest picture of what actually happens.
Once an engine,

276
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:57.700
bea Johnson became the new president's.

277
00:14:57.701 --> 00:15:01.400
He ordered an investigation known as the Warren Commission to examine the facts

278
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.000
of the shooting,
including a frame by frame analysis of the Zapruder film.

279
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.890
The head of the CIA,
Allen duals,

280
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.400
was one of the men on the committee and many believe that his influence

281
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:12.830
completely manipulated the results of the investigation.

282
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.790
The Warren Commission came to the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald worked
alone.

283
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.810
He was already under investigation for collaborating with the Soviet Union and

284
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:22.580
for being a potential terrorist.

285
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.890
He also worked at the Texas school book depository,

286
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.130
which is where he had set up his gun before he could be questioned in court.

287
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.940
Oswald was killed two days later by a man named Jack Ruby.

288
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.400
The incident was broadcast on live TV.

289
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.730
All of this seems to convenience and plenty of people believe that there was a

290
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:39.980
much larger conspiracy at hands.
Now,

291
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.330
there are a lot of theories out there about who was behind JFK assassination,

292
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:48.470
so keep in mind that we'll never have enough time to go over all of them in this

293
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:48.890
video.

294
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.920
One of the many reasons why people find the Warren Commission so hard to believe

295
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:56.180
is the fact that only three shell casings were found that were fought by Lee

296
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:56.240
Harvey Oswald.

297
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.170
Two out of three bullets were shattered upon impact and even tiny fragments

298
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:02.420
behind.
How about the is one bullet.

299
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.180
There's supposedly traveled through both John F.

300
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.870
Kennedy and governor Connally's bodies and yet somehow it remained completely

301
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:09.620
intact.

302
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.620
This idea is called the magic bullet theory and it's honestly really hard to

303
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:13.160
believe.

304
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.020
Many people believe that there were more than just three shots fired and that

305
00:16:16.021 --> 00:16:18.050
was a second gunman.
They believe this third,

306
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:20.660
but it was planted in the co off towards by the CIA.

307
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.190
If there was more than one shooter,

308
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:25.880
there is the very real possibility that multiple people were behind plotting his

309
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:30.881
death and the CIA wants us to believe that it was just one crazy American hating

310
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.830
terrorist.
One of the only ways to prove that the where are the shots,

311
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:36.110
five would be if we saw the proof on video.

312
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.710
There was supposedly a different angle films of the shooting by a man called

313
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.130
Orville Nix,
which is called the grassy knoll footage.

314
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.420
He sold one copy to the local press for $5,000 and he gave the second copy to

315
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:48.770
the FBI.
In this film,

316
00:16:48.771 --> 00:16:52.130
there is supposedly evidence that there was a second shooter hiding behind the

317
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:54.080
bushes in a grassy knoll.
However,

318
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:57.530
the government sees the footage and Nick's claims that when he was given it
back,

319
00:16:57.531 --> 00:17:00.470
there were sections of the tape that had been removed.
Orville Nix,

320
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:01.970
his granddaughter Gail Nix,

321
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:05.930
Jackson sued the u s government for $10 million or getting her family's original

322
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:06.740
film back.

323
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.740
This they claim to no longer have it in 2017 the CIA declassified thousands of

324
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:15.440
records about the JFK assassination that had never been seen by the public.

325
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.570
While it gives more insights into the case,

326
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:21.650
it does little to fuel the fire of any particular conspiracy theory.

327
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.850
We may never know the whole story of what happens during JFK assassination and

328
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:27.020
if the truth he wants to cover up,

329
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:29.630
we have no control over what's been done in the past.

330
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.630
If they could see what happened to his legacy,

331
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.940
surely Jack would want us to remember this.

332
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.800
He lived every day like it was his last,
and when asked if he has any regrets,

333
00:17:37.801 --> 00:17:40.880
Sione said,
I wish I had more good times.

334
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.550
We'll leave you today with the words of Jacqueline Kennedy.

335
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.400
Jack was young and loved.
You know everything.

336
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.950
Jack was the most unselfconscious person I'd ever seen.

337
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.120
He could naturally be attractive in a crowd,
in a room.

338
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.190
It was like having so many things in common with the many sides of view.

339
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.790
Everyone found a part of themselves in Jack.

340
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.340
So I already have you found that video.
