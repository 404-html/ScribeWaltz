00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.620
<v Speaker 1>He has come down through history as America's first serial killer,</v>

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the incarnation of pure evil.</v>

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.740
<v Speaker 1>He was the first of a new breed of American celebrity,</v>

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.491
<v Speaker 1>the handsome,</v>

5
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>debonair,</v>

6
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>superintelligence mass murderer is legends fields by his own insatiable</v>

7
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>appetite,</v>

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>for exaggeration,</v>

9
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>would turn him into a monster.</v>

10
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>The arch fiends of the age and the greatest criminal of this expiring century is</v>

11
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:23.511
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

12
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Castle situated at the heart of the world's greatest exhibition was reputedly.</v>

13
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>The scene of unspeakable horror is yes.</v>

14
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>The truth about Dr. h Dot h Holmes is far removed from the sensationalism that</v>

15
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>surrounds his name.</v>

16
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>No one did more to turn the gossip into legend than Holmes himself,</v>

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>which makes it all the more difficult to get the truth about the devil in the</v>

18
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:44.024
<v Speaker 1>white city.</v>

19
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I was born with a devil in me.</v>

20
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I could not help the fact that I was a murderer more than a poet's can help the</v>

21
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to sing</v>

22
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 2>who</v>

23
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>would come to call himself.</v>

24
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Henry Howard homes was born with a far less impressive name,</v>

25
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and that was webster mudget on the 16th of May,</v>

26
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:13.961
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

27
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>61 in Gill Manson,</v>

28
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:16.744
<v Speaker 1>New Hampshire.</v>

29
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.591
<v Speaker 1>By all accounts,</v>

30
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>his parents were upright and respectable people with the child's upbringing,</v>

31
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>being pretty unremarkable.</v>

32
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Laser stories that his father was a violent alcoholic.</v>

33
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>He would smother his children with chloroform,</v>

34
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>so handkerchiefs to you,</v>

35
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>teach them a lesson.</v>

36
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Are the results of a newspaper writers overactive imagination?</v>

37
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>There is one incident in his youth which clearly did have a profound impact on</v>

39
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>his later life when he was about 13,</v>

40
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>two older boys dragged them into the local doctor's office.</v>

41
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.201
<v Speaker 1>I play Simon,</v>

42
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>was terrified of because of the various tales had been told about body parts</v>

43
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>lying around the place.</v>

44
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>The bullies brought the terrified by face to face with a human skeleton,</v>

45
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>but rather than frightening him,</v>

46
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.953
<v Speaker 1>human bones,</v>

47
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>they fascinated the trials,</v>

48
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>this fascination.</v>

49
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It grew into an adult desire to study medicine,</v>

50
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>homes out another really fascination,</v>

51
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>and that was with women by the age of 16.</v>

52
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>He was working odd jobs when he fell head over heels in love with a beautiful</v>

53
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>young woman by the name of fire and the mets,</v>

54
00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Clara while working on her father's farm soon after they were both at a church.</v>

55
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Social Clara though,</v>

56
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>while she was flirting with another boy,</v>

57
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.860
<v Speaker 1>and this made young Herman see reds,</v>

58
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>he promptly marched.</v>

59
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Every other boy bands threatened to punch his lights out if he didn't.</v>

60
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Gala last well,</v>

61
00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>this thing to impress young Clara with Herman,</v>

62
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>escorting her home arm in arm.</v>

63
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>The next day.</v>

64
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>He was telling everyone that they were engaged.</v>

65
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.431
<v Speaker 1>The two,</v>

66
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>both 17 years of age at the time were married by a justice of the peace on</v>

67
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:38.951
<v Speaker 1>fourth of July,</v>

68
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:39.341
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

69
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:41.740
<v Speaker 1>78 for the first six months of the marriage.</v>

70
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.520
<v Speaker 1>It was kept a secret with a couple living apart with their parents when it was</v>

71
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>finally revealed farlands mother or Riley commented she couldn't have done much</v>

72
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>worse and we'll probably have to support you as father arranged for her to work</v>

73
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>in his brother's grocery store in east concourse.</v>

74
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Nine months later,</v>

75
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Clara she gave birth to a son named Robert.</v>

76
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Becoming a father.</v>

77
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Seems to have inspired him in because he was interested in medicine.</v>

78
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He quit the store on Wednesday to take up an apprenticeship under Dr. Right.</v>

79
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>The owner of the office in which had been introduced to the skeleton six years</v>

80
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.214
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>

81
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>ballroom and the baby went to live with our parents.</v>

82
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>The budding medical took up more formal studies at the medical school in</v>

84
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.041
<v Speaker 1>Burlington,</v>

85
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Vermont.</v>

86
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>During this time.</v>

87
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.640
<v Speaker 1>He conducted himself as a single man.</v>

88
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.181
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

89
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>he carried on a relationship with the daughter of his landlord.</v>

90
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Lives became so passionate that people thought they were engaged.</v>

91
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>When Hammond's remade,</v>

92
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Fred ingles revealed to the girl's father,</v>

93
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but he was already married.</v>

94
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>The two time that lead a thrashing on Ingolstadt left him with a black eye and</v>

95
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>scratched face.</v>

96
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Darker than this though was the fact that the wife of the owner of the boarding</v>

97
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>house once noticed a foul smell emanating from Herman's room on investigating.</v>

98
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>She was horrifying to find a dead baby under his bed.</v>

99
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>His explanation was that had been experimenting with dissections is part of his</v>

100
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.063
<v Speaker 1>homework.</v>

101
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Herman was warms.</v>

102
00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Do never bring dead bodies into the house again it to how many wins an audit to</v>

103
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:13.110
<v Speaker 1>study at the University of Michigan at this time,</v>

104
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>he took his wife and son with him,</v>

105
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.690
<v Speaker 1>but the marriage,</v>

106
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>while it was already on shaky grounds,</v>

107
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>other residents of the boarding house,</v>

108
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>but they live in later records that the couple often quarrels with Clara</v>

109
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>frequently sporting black eyes.</v>

110
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>At some point cholera.</v>

111
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Mr decided she had enough because she returns home with her baby then marriage.</v>

112
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:29.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:30.390
<v Speaker 1>it was effectively over,</v>

114
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but this would never be formalized now on infested by family home and threw</v>

115
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>himself into his studies.</v>

116
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 1>He was particularly fascinated with the dissection of human bodies.</v>

117
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.931
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

118
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.470
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than the country's Wayne's of flesh and pull out body organs.</v>

119
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.910
<v Speaker 1>One small and he took to taking home infant corpses to work on during the spring</v>

120
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>break.</v>

121
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>This fellow students remembered that harmon's fascination with dissection.</v>

122
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it was unnatural mender nerving,</v>

124
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.020
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the question of whether or not Hammond participated in a ruse</v>

125
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 1>of faking someone's death in order to collect insurance money and is very</v>

126
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:01.261
<v Speaker 1>dubious.</v>

127
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:02.011
<v Speaker 1>Autobiography.</v>

128
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>He claims that he and his medical student pals spoke of the idea but never</v>

129
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>actually did it and given his pension for self exaggeration,</v>

130
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>it seems unlikely he would have been shy about revealing this v one scandal from</v>

131
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:13.861
<v Speaker 1>his college days,</v>

132
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>which can be substantiated as involves not surprisingly,</v>

133
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>are women though still married to Clara.</v>

134
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 1>He began courting the women in his boarding house.</v>

135
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:22.014
<v Speaker 1>He resided.</v>

136
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.460
<v Speaker 1>He had promised to marry her.</v>

137
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.210
<v Speaker 1>The new women found the letter in his room that was signed by his wife.</v>

138
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>This certainly shocked to women,</v>

139
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but she should have counted ourselves.</v>

140
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky at least she didn't find a dead baby.</v>

141
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

142
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the women complained to the medical school faculty citing breach of promise.</v>

143
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Payment appeared at a hearing and themes that woman was lying and that he never</v>

144
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>promised to marry her heart.</v>

145
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.940
<v Speaker 1>The faculty believed him and he was acquitted.</v>

146
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>A few months later on being handed his graduation diploma,</v>

147
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:51.080
<v Speaker 1>though harmon approached his professor and said Dr. focused things that women</v>

148
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>said about me on twitter</v>

149
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.950
<v Speaker 1>after graduating and lived with his family back in New Hampshire during the</v>

150
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.783
<v Speaker 1>summer.</v>

151
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.671
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't.</v>

152
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>He began working as both a physician and a school teacher in New York.</v>

153
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.931
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

154
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>he gains a reputation as a debt default and a womanizer.</v>

155
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>He proposed marriage to to more women that with the latter mini Everett's</v>

156
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>backing out with a prophetic reflection,</v>

157
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>there is something lacking in that man's character that time will reveal.</v>

158
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I do not like him.</v>

159
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I firmly believe that he would commit murder.</v>

160
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Herman also acquired a reputation as a swindler.</v>

161
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't use any number of excuses to get out of paying his rent.</v>

162
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.251
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

163
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>he left town in the middle of the night in order to escape a mountain of debt,</v>

164
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>even swindled the price of his train ticket out of town.</v>

165
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It was may of 18,</v>

166
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>66 and that swindled train ticket and taken him to Chicago.</v>

167
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.100
<v Speaker 1>It was his intention to find work in a drug store,</v>

168
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>but he needed a pharmacy license.</v>

169
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 1>In order to do that.</v>

170
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>You went to Springfield and sat a three day examination.</v>

171
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It was subsequently announced in the press that Harry h homes passed the bar.</v>

172
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>This announcement is it marks the first time that the home's alias was used,</v>

173
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>why he chose to call himself Harry Howard.</v>

174
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Homes is still unknown,</v>

175
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>contrary to what many people think.</v>

176
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not a nod to sherlock holmes,</v>

177
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Conan Doyle's most famous creation would not appear for yet another year almost</v>

178
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>christened as new name by becoming a big ernest on the way to Chicago.</v>

179
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.940
<v Speaker 1>He spent time in Minneapolis where he took up with and then married a young</v>

180
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:21.700
<v Speaker 1>woman named Mirta belknap.</v>

181
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>That's where she was rather plain looking,</v>

182
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>but her parents had money and that was enough for homes.</v>

183
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after moving to Chicago,</v>

184
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:32.981
<v Speaker 1>he used this wealth to purchase a parcel of land on what was then 701 to 700 and</v>

185
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:33.741
<v Speaker 1>360,</v>

186
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>third street and Englewood.</v>

187
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.210
<v Speaker 1>He had ownership but in zoo,</v>

188
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:36.981
<v Speaker 1>his wife's name,</v>

189
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and then into that if our mother,</v>

190
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>in order to keep the credit as a bay almost mythology tells us that the bad</v>

191
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>doctor needled his way into the employers are bedridden.</v>

192
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Pharmacist named e s Holton,</v>

193
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>who's young wife was run off our feet,</v>

194
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>operating the business by herself.</v>

195
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Homes was hard to take over the operation and shortly thereafter the couple</v>

196
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 1>disappeared with the implication here being that homes murdered them,</v>

197
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't at all the reality of the situation.</v>

198
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

199
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Dr. yes,</v>

200
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Holton,</v>

201
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>whereas actually the wife or husband's rather than being on his deathbed was a</v>

202
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>robust longshoreman.</v>

203
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Dr Olsen's are on homes and found him to be and the ideal asset for the</v>

204
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

205
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 1>When she became pregnant with our second child in 18,</v>

206
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>87,</v>

207
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>she decided to sell the pharmacy to homes rather than disappearing.</v>

208
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>The holtons both lived well into the 20th century remaining in these same</v>

209
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods.</v>

210
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>That whole time the pharmacy business became a great success,</v>

211
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>becoming especially popular with young women who came from afar to be served by</v>

212
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the charming,</v>

213
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 1>handsome new doctor,</v>

214
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>honestly begins eating on assistants who were invariably a nubile young beauties</v>

215
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>who were flocking to Chicago by the train.</v>

216
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.081
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

217
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>homes turns his attention to the vacant lot that he owned on the same street as</v>

218
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the pharmacy plan to construct a two story building with retail space on the</v>

219
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 1>first floor and residential apartments on these seconds.</v>

220
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>The building had some unusual features.</v>

221
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 1>There was a hidden compartment between the first and second floors along with a</v>

222
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>staircase between floors and that could only be reached from a trapdoor in the</v>

223
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:01.150
<v Speaker 1>second story buffering far more troubling than these designed quacks,</v>

224
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

225
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>was the fact that Holmes refused to pay his bills when the build is I've never</v>

226
00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>iron and steel sued in 18.</v>

227
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 1>80 eight homes,</v>

228
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>claimed at the team wasn't liable because the building was actually owned by his</v>

229
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>mother in law when the building company lies began to chronicle his involvement</v>

230
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.450
<v Speaker 1>in the project homes alleged event,</v>

231
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the steel beams provided was too short,</v>

232
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>which negated the entire contract.</v>

233
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Defending himself in court apparently did nothing to dwindle his passion for</v>

234
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>swindling.</v>

235
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>His favorite trick was buying goods on credit and then selling them for cash and</v>

236
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>not paying the original bill.</v>

237
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.281
<v Speaker 1>In one case,</v>

238
00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 1>he purchased in this specialty heavy,</v>

239
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 1>safe on credit and had it installed on the first floor of his new building.</v>

240
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Having balls bells around that.</v>

241
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>When the repossession agents came knocking homes replied,</v>

242
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and take the safe,</v>

243
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>but I warn you not to damage the building.</v>

244
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>They're repossessing as they struggled for hours.</v>

245
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Finally realizing that they couldn't get it out without tearing down a wall.</v>

246
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>They have no choice but to leave the safe exactly where it was.</v>

247
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.620
<v Speaker 1>The people who worked for homes single use to is quirky ways he wants invited to</v>

248
00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:10.310
<v Speaker 1>work at do you step inside the safe and start yelling when homes close the door</v>

249
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.990
<v Speaker 1>in order to test if it was soundproof,</v>

250
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.560
<v Speaker 1>his housekeeper would also regularly catch tip toeing around at night and the</v>

251
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 1>janitor who worked at the pharmacy records a time when homes showed him a</v>

252
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:21.490
<v Speaker 1>collection of fake beards and other discussions,</v>

253
00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:22.520
<v Speaker 1>is it 1990,</v>

254
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.300
<v Speaker 1>almost decided to sell the drugstore business in order to focus on real estate.</v>

255
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>

256
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.270
<v Speaker 1>the salads and into another swindle.</v>

257
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.040
<v Speaker 1>After the new owner took possession,</v>

258
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:34.460
<v Speaker 1>he was shocked to find that much of the floor stock had not been paid for with</v>

259
00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:38.780
<v Speaker 1>repossession agents claiming them back still somehow managed to talk his way out</v>

260
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:39.530
<v Speaker 1>of this struggle.</v>

261
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.010
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

262
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>even though he no longer owns the drugstore,</v>

263
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>he still spent a lot of time there.</v>

264
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.440
<v Speaker 1>He just so happened to be on hands.</v>

265
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:49.100
<v Speaker 1>One day when one of the new investors showed up with important information to</v>

266
00:10:49.101 --> 00:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>share the mend and inexplicably collapsed right outside the drug store.</v>

267
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Holmes was the first one to aside pouring a dark liquids down the man's throat.</v>

268
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Within minutes he was debt.</v>

269
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>This was likely the first person to die at bands of Dr Holmes killed,</v>

270
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>likely because he knew too much about the magic magic,</v>

271
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.060
<v Speaker 1>although we'll never really know what that information he had was in July of 18,</v>

272
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:13.061
<v Speaker 1>89 homes employed a young couple conant who worked in the pharmacy and lived on</v>

273
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:16.460
<v Speaker 1>the second floor of the recently completed anglewood building.</v>

274
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Within a month,</v>

275
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>pons and Julia were engaged in a fat even as myrtle lived under the same roof.</v>

276
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.150
<v Speaker 1>This understandably drove a wedge between the couple with ned filing for divorce</v>

277
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 1>and quitting homes as employee.</v>

278
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Julia now started doing tango herself in homes.</v>

279
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.530
<v Speaker 1>There's financial web enlisted our whereas the cofounder of a number of</v>

280
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:36.200
<v Speaker 1>businesses and took out numerous steps in our name.</v>

281
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Then on July the fourth,</v>

282
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:37.791
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

283
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:38.300
<v Speaker 1>91,</v>

284
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Julia and say,</v>

285
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.831
<v Speaker 1>Reggie rolled daughter,</v>

286
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:42.470
<v Speaker 1>pearl disappeared off the face of the earth.</v>

287
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 1>The body is whenever discovered and Tom's never confessed to murdering them,</v>

288
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.390
<v Speaker 1>but it seems quite likely that they were the victims if the deadly doctor around</v>

289
00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 1>this same time on started a brand new business and this the warner glass bending</v>

290
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

291
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that he knew nothing about glass bending,</v>

292
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 1>he convinced those who would listen,</v>

293
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.300
<v Speaker 1>that he had invented a unique gloss bending technique to perfect.</v>

294
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>He had built a furnace in the basement of his two story building and made a</v>

295
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>great show of setting to work though no one actually saw him.</v>

296
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.233
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>

297
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 2>the last</v>

298
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.830
<v Speaker 1>after the establishment of his basement furnace,</v>

299
00:12:21.831 --> 00:12:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the disappearance of young women who came into homes is circle became more and</v>

300
00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:26.360
<v Speaker 1>more frequent.</v>

301
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.171
<v Speaker 1>First there was emily,</v>

302
00:12:27.171 --> 00:12:27.861
<v Speaker 1>instagrams.</v>

303
00:12:27.861 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You came to Chicago looking for work in May of 18,</v>

304
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>92 homes,</v>

305
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.160
<v Speaker 1>employer as a typewriter girl,</v>

306
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.450
<v Speaker 1>and we're seeing getting much more for his money.</v>

307
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.580
<v Speaker 1>When the girl disappeared around Christmas time,</v>

308
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 1>homes dismissed is with what became a common explanation.</v>

309
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.510
<v Speaker 1>She's gone to Europe to get married by the end of 18,</v>

310
00:12:44.511 --> 00:12:44.901
<v Speaker 1>92.</v>

311
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:46.620
<v Speaker 1>The whole city of Chicago was a buzzword.</v>

312
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.510
<v Speaker 1>The prospect of the approaching welds fat in celebration of the 400th</v>

313
00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:53.630
<v Speaker 1>anniversary of Columbus is landing on the America's.</v>

314
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Never want to pass up an opportunity.</v>

315
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Homeless quickly had a third story put onto his building to serve as a hotel.</v>

316
00:12:59.180 --> 00:12:59.580
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

317
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.660
<v Speaker 1>he never really intended to use the floor as a hotel.</v>

318
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.140
<v Speaker 1>The amount of homes could make renting out rooms were small potatoes compared</v>

319
00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:06.500
<v Speaker 1>with water.</v>

320
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 1>You could make a buying,</v>

321
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.940
<v Speaker 1>convincing others that he was opening a hotel with such a venture in the work so</v>

322
00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you could raise money from investors who never see a penny back.</v>

323
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.180
<v Speaker 1>You can also find numerous goods on credits and sell them without paying for</v>

324
00:13:17.181 --> 00:13:17.510
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

325
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And then as a final windfall,</v>

326
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.580
<v Speaker 1>he decided to make thousands and insurance money by setting the building on</v>

327
00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>

328
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.990
<v Speaker 1>just like the popular notion that the hotel was flourishing during the welds</v>

329
00:13:26.991 --> 00:13:27.381
<v Speaker 1>fan,</v>

330
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.180
<v Speaker 1>during countless women do that death.</v>

331
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>They're all known records that he even took in a single paying customer when he</v>

332
00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:36.410
<v Speaker 1>set the structure of blaze 18,</v>

333
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 1>93 to claim the insurance,</v>

334
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>the only people on the site where longterm residents,</v>

335
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 1>the resulting claim would spend years going through the courts,</v>

336
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>by which time the claimant's it'd be behind bars.</v>

337
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.360
<v Speaker 1>With balancing lawsuits,</v>

338
00:13:56.361 --> 00:13:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Holmes decided that it was time to quit.</v>

339
00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Chicago has traveled to countries</v>

340
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Lewis and finally to Philadelphia</v>

341
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>

342
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 1>We got married once more this time to a 23 year old with a $2,000 in Harrison's.</v>

343
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.170
<v Speaker 1>He also fell in with a likeminded swindler by the name of Benjamin Quetzal</v>

344
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Pencil.</v>

345
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Old Lady got himself thrown in jail to passing bad checks and swanee was inside</v>

346
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.630
<v Speaker 1>almost began paying the premiums on the life insurance policy when he got out</v>

347
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>the to joined forces and not just a vacant lot in Fort Worth.</v>

348
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>they set about building a replica of the complex that Holmes had built and then</v>

350
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:30.440
<v Speaker 1>burned to the ground in Chicago,</v>

351
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 1>just linked the original building,</v>

352
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 1>the Texas hotel featured a number of strange passengers and twists,</v>

353
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but just what homes planning to do with a building is unclear.</v>

354
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 1>He never hung around long enough to use it.</v>

355
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>What he did do was take out tens of thousands of dollars on mortgages in it and</v>

356
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>then disappear without making more than a couple of token payments for to move</v>

357
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 1>to send the new as well on sport drugstore for the down payments of $50 and</v>

358
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>promissory notes that are completely worthless.</v>

359
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>What a surprise.</v>

360
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Had Ben approached a drugstore supply runs,</v>

361
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 1>convinced him that he was interested in buying the drugstore from homes.</v>

362
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 1>If that ends in the money,</v>

363
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>he would then use them as their main supplier.</v>

364
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 1>They agreed these winds,</v>

365
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 1>although it came unstuck when the drugstores or app called in the next day only</v>

366
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:10.401
<v Speaker 1>to find the place,</v>

367
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 1>shut it up.</v>

368
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>It got suspicious and causing the authorities almost was arrested and he spent</v>

369
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.334
<v Speaker 1>three days.</v>

370
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.353
<v Speaker 2>Jay</v>

371
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.581
<v Speaker 1>on his release,</v>

372
00:15:26.581 --> 00:15:29.790
<v Speaker 1>homesteaded for Philadelphia and that least Wyndell that would prove his</v>

373
00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:30.624
<v Speaker 1>undoing.</v>

374
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

375
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.310
<v Speaker 1>he plans to make good on those insurance premiums.</v>

376
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Had paid for pf still a few months back.</v>

377
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.000
<v Speaker 1>The team then had long been scheming to defraud the fidelity mutual insurance</v>

378
00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:40.680
<v Speaker 1>company by faking capsules,</v>

379
00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:43.260
<v Speaker 1>deaf and splitting the proceeds in early September.</v>

380
00:15:43.261 --> 00:15:43.710
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

381
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:44.310
<v Speaker 1>cancel golf,</v>

382
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.900
<v Speaker 1>cold feet and wanted to back out,</v>

383
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.860
<v Speaker 1>and I'm happy homes agreed to meet up the next day to further discuss the issue.</v>

384
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.900
<v Speaker 1>When he turns up at Pitt source address,</v>

385
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:52.171
<v Speaker 1>homeless,</v>

386
00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:53.820
<v Speaker 1>proceeded to get him drunk.</v>

387
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Then he knocked him out with chloroform handkerchief,</v>

388
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.910
<v Speaker 1>increasing his dosage into this old friend was debt homes,</v>

389
00:15:59.911 --> 00:16:02.670
<v Speaker 1>then attempted to stage the scene to make it look like an accident.</v>

390
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Then we're this 23 year old wife into.</v>

391
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.810
<v Speaker 1>He jumped on the train for Indianapolis,</v>

392
00:16:06.811 --> 00:16:10.440
<v Speaker 1>intends on securing the $10,000 insurance payout.</v>

393
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

394
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the payoff was made to be at sols widow,</v>

395
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:17.880
<v Speaker 1>but homeless convinced her that her husband had died in $7,500 for the taxes</v>

396
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:18.570
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

397
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.660
<v Speaker 1>She handed the money over as an active seeming graciousness.</v>

398
00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Homes agreed to accompany in bps,</v>

399
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:27.180
<v Speaker 1>all children to Indianapolis where they were to stay with that arms before he</v>

400
00:16:27.181 --> 00:16:27.751
<v Speaker 1>could deliver them.</v>

401
00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:28.201
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

402
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:30.150
<v Speaker 1>and he discovered that he was a wanted man.</v>

403
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Authorities from a number of states,</v>

404
00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:33.240
<v Speaker 1>including Philadelphia</v>

405
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.820
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>

406
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

407
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Now officially on the run,</v>

408
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.100
<v Speaker 1>he moved the children all over the countryside.</v>

409
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.950
<v Speaker 1>At some point you decided that the children would have to die.</v>

410
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.640
<v Speaker 1>The youngest eight year old Howard was poisoned with cyanide while the two</v>

411
00:16:53.641 --> 00:16:54.121
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

412
00:16:54.121 --> 00:16:55.470
<v Speaker 1>but like he gassed to death.</v>

413
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.510
<v Speaker 1>The bodies were buried in a cellar by now.</v>

414
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Detectives were hot on homelessness trail.</v>

415
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.670
<v Speaker 1>They finally caught up with him in Boston and of all things arrested him for</v>
