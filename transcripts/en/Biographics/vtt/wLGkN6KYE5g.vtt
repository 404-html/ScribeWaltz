00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>He sees you when you were sleeping.</v>

2
00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>He knows when you're awake.</v>

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>He knows when you've been bad or good,</v>

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>so be good for goodness sake.</v>

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>If you live in the western world,</v>

6
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:14.451
<v Speaker 1>you already know this line from Santa Claus is coming to town by Harry Connick</v>

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.821
<v Speaker 1>Jr.</v>

8
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>We've all heard the songs and seeing the movies,</v>

9
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.881
<v Speaker 1>but do you may not know the true story behind the legend of the man who can fly</v>

10
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>around the world in just a single night?</v>

11
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.091
<v Speaker 1>Any mind?</v>

12
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:26.761
<v Speaker 1>They'll be wondering,</v>

13
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>why am I wearing a hat that is not a Santa Claus hat and that is because for</v>

14
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>this very special Christmas video,</v>

15
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get a Santa Claus hat,</v>

16
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>but apparently I have a giant head and this Christmas tree house was the only</v>

17
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>thing that would fit me.</v>

18
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take this off and we're going to get on with today's video.</v>

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas of Bari was born in the fourth century in the town of Myra,</v>

20
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>located in Asia Minor.</v>

21
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>This is now modern day Turkey.</v>

22
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>His parents were wealthy Christians who had trouble conceiving a child for many</v>

23
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

24
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>They prayed to God every day to have a child if their very own,</v>

25
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:13.580
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as they finally conceived and gave birth to a son,</v>

26
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>they saw it as Trudy America.</v>

27
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Sadly Nicholas's parents,</v>

28
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they would die of an epidemic that spread throughout the city of my relieving</v>

29
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>him to become a young orphan.</v>

30
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>He was raised by his uncle,</v>

31
00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>who was the bishop of Myra,</v>

32
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>who would never had children of his own.</v>

33
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>He was very proud of his nephew,</v>

34
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>especially when he grew up to be a very well behaved boy.</v>

35
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>His uncle apparently announced to everyone in the church that he had a vision</v>

36
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.010
<v Speaker 1>that his nephew would grow up to bring joy to many people.</v>

37
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>When Nicholas grew up,</v>

38
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>his uncle's prophecy actually did come true.</v>

39
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>He was always kind to others and twin town of his way to help people as an</v>

40
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:44.601
<v Speaker 1>orphan.</v>

41
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas had a special place in his heart for children and he would often help</v>

42
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>them make handmade toys to play with.</v>

43
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Even though he was from a wealthy family,</v>

44
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>he still had a lot of sympathy for the poor and he wanted to do whatever he</v>

45
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>could to help.</v>

46
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>There was a man in the town who had three beautiful daughters,</v>

47
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but he was so poor he could not pay for a dowery.</v>

48
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>This meant that his daughters could not get married and so they would have to be</v>

49
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.090
<v Speaker 1>sold into slavery because the father could not afford to support them.</v>

50
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas wanted to help,</v>

51
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>but he did not want to hurt the father's pride by offering a donation face to</v>

52
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

53
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>so he dropped a bag of gold down the chimney,</v>

54
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>which lands in their stockings that were hanging up to dry.</v>

55
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Speaker 1>The father and his daughters,</v>

56
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>they jumped for joy,</v>

57
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>believing that God had finally answered their prayers.</v>

58
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>He was finally able to pay for the dowery and all his daughter went on to get</v>

59
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

60
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas came back to do this again for the two younger daughters,</v>

61
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>which is when he was caught in the acts.</v>

62
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew this gold wasn't just appearing out of thin air and people began</v>

63
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>to whisper around town.</v>

64
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>About a young Nicholas and his kind heart and his generosity.</v>

65
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas was a very simple person who didn't need a lot to be happy and the</v>

66
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>money didn't mean much to him,</v>

67
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>but he knew that his donations could be life changing for other families and</v>

68
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Myra,</v>

69
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>he just sent me did to continue paying attention to people who needed the most</v>

70
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>help in the city and he would always anonymously give away his inheritance,</v>

71
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.630
<v Speaker 1>have a people off to this story spread around town people again,</v>

72
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>

73
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>leave that stockings and shoes by the fireplace in hopes that they would receive</v>

74
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>gold from Nicholas as well.</v>

75
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.101
<v Speaker 1>Soon Office of this,</v>

76
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>people throughout the city of Myra were receiving anonymous presence that would</v>

77
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>mysteriously appear in their homes.</v>

78
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>This box has spirit of giving a neighbors.</v>

79
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>We're now helping out one another in that time of need without fear of hurting</v>

80
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:21.724
<v Speaker 1>that pride.</v>

81
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Anytime an anonymous gift would show up,</v>

82
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>they designed it to thank Nicholas.</v>

83
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Even if he wasn't the ones who actually deliver every single present.</v>

84
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>People begin to remove that since this man seemed to be able to be in many</v>

85
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.221
<v Speaker 1>places at once,</v>

86
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>he was more than just a devout Christian men.</v>

87
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>They believed that he had been blessed with magical powers.</v>

88
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Now he truly did begins you travel across Turkey and he reached a point where he</v>

89
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>had given away all of his earthly possessions,</v>

90
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>which was totally fine with him.</v>

91
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>He at that point,</v>

92
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>is devoted his life to becoming a monk.</v>

93
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>We know with absolute certainty that Nicholas truly was a real person because he</v>

94
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:55.310
<v Speaker 1>grew up to take over his uncle,</v>

95
00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>his position as the next bishop of Myra.</v>

96
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>There are records of his participation in the first council of Nicea,</v>

97
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>including his outspoken outrage over the corruption that he saw within the</v>

98
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church.</v>

99
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>In one story,</v>

100
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas witnessed a horrific scene where children had been kidnapped since he</v>

101
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>was then able to rescue them.</v>

102
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>He was seen as such a hoodie man that he was the nature canonized,</v>

103
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>a Saint Nicholas,</v>

104
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>the patron saint of children,</v>

105
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>and surprisingly sailors.</v>

106
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.520
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

107
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Saint Nick.</v>

108
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.761
<v Speaker 1>I love to travel.</v>

109
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.594
<v Speaker 1>Even back then.</v>

110
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>He sailed along the coast of Asia.</v>

111
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Minor ins dreamed of seeing the entire planet,</v>

112
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>so he has to come sailors,</v>

113
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.010
<v Speaker 1>which continue to pray to some Nicholas to help them whenever they were on a</v>

114
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>long voyage.</v>

115
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Legend has it that one day Turkish sailors were out at sea.</v>

116
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>The winds and waves were so strong that the men were afraid that the boat would</v>

117
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.144
<v Speaker 1>capsize.</v>

118
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 1>They prayed to Saint Nicholas for help and he appeared before them.</v>

119
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>With his arms outstretched.</v>

120
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He was able to control the weather and it's calm the ocean and the sailors made</v>

121
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.744
<v Speaker 1>it home safely.</v>

122
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>This was just one of the many examples.</v>

123
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>If the stories of Nick's extraordinary magical powers,</v>

124
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and it just may be a good explanation of how center managers to travel in his</v>

125
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>sleigh through all kinds of weather,</v>

126
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the fantastical stories of Sedna,</v>

127
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>this loss did for longer than just one lifetime.</v>

128
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Historically didn't need to go on for another thousand years.</v>

129
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>It would seem that the magic behind his generosity was so inspiring and</v>

130
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

131
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It was enough to keep them alive in the hearts of mankind for generations to</v>

132
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.534
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

133
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>From the fourth to the 16th centuries,</v>

134
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas became one of the most popular Catholic scenes.</v>

135
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>People continue to pray to him,</v>

136
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>wishing for his help in their time of need.</v>

137
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.751
<v Speaker 1>As time went on,</v>

138
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>he preferred to receive letters rather than press.</v>

139
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>It was probably much easier for him to keep records this way.</v>

140
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Stories of cynics magic and generosity began to spread throughout the rest of</v>

141
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>the wells.</v>

142
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.701
<v Speaker 1>In the Netherlands,</v>

143
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Belgium and Switzerland.</v>

144
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Children began to leave the shoes outside on Saint Nicholas Day,</v>

145
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>so the to the Jolly Sinta class could leave them presence.</v>

146
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.891
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>

147
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>small toys and candy were left for them when they work in the morning after the</v>

148
00:05:57.801 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Protestant reformation,</v>

149
00:05:58.881 --> 00:05:59.551
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther,</v>

150
00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do away with the stories of Catholic saints,</v>

151
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>so he said that these presence were actually coming from the baby Jesus or</v>

152
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Christ candle.</v>

153
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>People were confused,</v>

154
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:09.471
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

155
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>because they knew that the real gift giver was the Jolly old son,</v>

156
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.281
<v Speaker 1>Nick,</v>

157
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>delivering the presence to these children.</v>

158
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>So Christ Kendall was misunderstood to be Kris Kringle Lens.</v>

159
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>The nickname stock after the revolutionary war,</v>

160
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>there was a movement to reject many of the English ways and start new traditions</v>

161
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>the way uniquely American and author by the name of Washington and I haven't had</v>

162
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>already made a name for himself by writing and publishing American folk tales</v>

163
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that had been told by word of mouth,</v>

164
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>like Rip Van Winkle Lens,</v>

165
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>the spooky legend of sleepy hollow.</v>

166
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>This became a Halloween classic.</v>

167
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.140
<v Speaker 1>So when he heard about the Dutch story of Sinterklaas see,</v>

168
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>decided to officially give him the properly American sounding name,</v>

169
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Santa Claus.</v>

170
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>This is house and Nick officially became a part of the American Christmas</v>

171
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

172
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Either the next few hundred years the public would learn more about Santa Claus</v>

173
00:06:55.611 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>then they had known before in 1809 I haven't wrote in his book knickerbockers</v>

174
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>history of New York about a surprising Santa Siting in central park.</v>

175
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It read the good Saint Nicholas came riding over the tops of the trees in that</v>

176
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>selfsame wagon wearing.</v>

177
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>He brings his yearly presence to children.</v>

178
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 1>He went on to explain the sense it took a break to smoke his pipe of tobacco</v>

179
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.180
<v Speaker 1>before getting that in his wagon.</v>

180
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Then flying away.</v>

181
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.831
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

182
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:19.551
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

183
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>modern sensor has given up smoking,</v>

184
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't replaced it with a serious cookie addiction,</v>

185
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>so it's not exactly kind on his ever expanding waistline.</v>

186
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>As the years went on,</v>

187
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 1>more and more writers would elaborate with additional details and now sound to</v>

188
00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>

189
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>In December of 1823 a writer named Clement Clarke Moore was walking through the</v>

190
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>snow on his way home under his arm.</v>

191
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>He had a Christmas Darcie for his family and looking around at the beautiful</v>

192
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:42.321
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>

193
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he was suddenly inspired to write a poem.</v>

194
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>It titles of visit from Saint Nicholas,</v>

195
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 1>but you probably know that as the night before Christmas.</v>

196
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>It was the night before Christmas when all through the house,</v>

197
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 1>not a creature was stirring,</v>

198
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>not even a mouse.</v>

199
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.300
<v Speaker 1>The stockings were hung by the chimney with pat and the hopes that Saint</v>

200
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas,</v>

201
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.593
<v Speaker 1>which soon</v>

202
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>this became an incredibly popular poem.</v>

203
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>It's so perfectly captured the Christmas spirit so that in just a few years,</v>

204
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>nearly every American would know it by heart.</v>

205
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Instead of thinking of his time living in Turkey as a fourth century St people.</v>

206
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Now Imagine Santa clause to be a chatty jolly old man who climbed through the</v>

207
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>chimney to place presence in stockings and leave them wrapped up under the</v>

208
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:25.364
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree.</v>

209
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So I said Nick had always been a sailor and as an avid traveler throughout his</v>

210
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:29.380
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

211
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Now the gauging the open sea is no easy task,</v>

212
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>especially before the benefits of gps,</v>

213
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but he wants it to get around on land at a much faster pace.</v>

214
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>In 1921 and anonymous author wrote and illustrated a story called old Santa</v>

215
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Claus with much delight.</v>

216
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.320
<v Speaker 1>For the first time the public learns that center had upgraded his ride from a</v>

217
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>rickety old wagon and is a boat to a proper sled,</v>

218
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>pulls by a single raindance.</v>

219
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>In 1889 poet Katharine Lee Bates introduced the world to Mrs Clause and we got</v>

220
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:57.421
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>

221
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>and it's a bit more about some next personal life.</v>

222
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 1>We still don't know exactly when they got married,</v>

223
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:06.810
<v Speaker 1>but this couple have what is probably the longest lasting marriage in history.</v>

224
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>We also don't know if they ever had any children together.</v>

225
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>As the years went on,</v>

226
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.500
<v Speaker 1>the public learns more about centers,</v>

227
00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>progress in his mission to bring joy into the world.</v>

228
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>We learned that he moved his new secret hideouts to the North Pole and he hired</v>

229
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>a team of elves to run his workshop.</v>

230
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.940
<v Speaker 1>We were introduced to his extended fleet of eight magic reindeer and in 1939 he</v>

231
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:29.750
<v Speaker 1>added to the newest member of the team Rudolph the red nose reindeer.</v>

232
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>In 1891 even the presidents of the United States was promoting Santa Claus.</v>

233
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Harrison told the breasts,</v>

234
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>we shall have an old fashioned Christmas tree for the grandchildren upstairs and</v>

235
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I shall be the Santa Claus Myself.</v>

236
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>That's me hope that my example will be followed by every family and the land.</v>

237
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.810
<v Speaker 1>The very first video footage have captured of Santa Claus was in 1898 by a film</v>

238
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>maker named Je Ne Smith.</v>

239
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 1>The wells could see him leaving presence for sleeping children on Christmas Eve.</v>

240
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.271
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

241
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:00.050
<v Speaker 1>as time went on and modern technology improved,</v>

242
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>more and more people were capturing footage of Santa Claus.</v>

243
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It was finally time for him to come out of hiding and make his first public</v>

244
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:07.704
<v Speaker 1>appearances.</v>

245
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Moving into the 20th century,</v>

246
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>it sounds a clause was always hip to the modern times during the industrial</v>

247
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:19.791
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

248
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>He was able to improve as operations with as Elf employees working the assembly</v>

249
00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:28.100
<v Speaker 1>lines in his workshop at the North Pole sound the game more like the CEO of his</v>

250
00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:28.970
<v Speaker 1>toy empire,</v>

251
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.580
<v Speaker 1>making sure the operation run as smoothly as possible.</v>

252
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Now that he wasn't running as workshop alone,</v>

253
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:37.730
<v Speaker 1>he was finally able to make the time to begin making public appearances.</v>

254
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.020
<v Speaker 1>In 1924 he decided to be a part of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New</v>

255
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.530
<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>

256
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.120
<v Speaker 1>It received such a warm welcome from his adoring fans that he decided to reapply</v>

257
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.920
<v Speaker 1>every single year ever since.</v>

258
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>So long as the organizers meet the demand on his ride or to provide him a tall</v>

259
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:56.210
<v Speaker 1>glass of milk and some warm chocolate chip cookies in the green room in the</v>

260
00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:59.630
<v Speaker 1>1980s brought the boom of the shopping mall in the United States and this began</v>

261
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 1>the tradition of Santa Claus taking personal requests from boys and girls.</v>

262
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.790
<v Speaker 1>There is even a massive party gold Sandvik on held every year in New York City,</v>

263
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 1>which isn't even a real convention.</v>

264
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just an excuse to dress a and nick and party in the streets.</v>

265
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.510
<v Speaker 1>There is also the livable Santa Dash and so many other events all around the</v>

266
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.310
<v Speaker 1>world that are thrown in is on that.</v>

267
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Moving into the 21st century,</v>

268
00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>modern technology has helped us truly break down the science of just how center</v>

269
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:25.851
<v Speaker 1>manages to make.</v>

270
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 1>As Jenny,</v>

271
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.490
<v Speaker 1>you can track some nicks progress on Google maps is Santa Tracker and in 2016</v>

272
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the Mira did an intensive study of this statistics of centers magical Jenny.</v>

273
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:36.554
<v Speaker 1>On Christmas Eve.</v>

274
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.930
<v Speaker 1>They discovered that in order for him to deliver presence,</v>

275
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you every single child in the weld on a single night,</v>

276
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.420
<v Speaker 1>he would need to travel at speeds of 1,280 miles per second.</v>

277
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Even though the world love Santa Claus,</v>

278
00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean his legacy has been free from controversy in he is often for</v>

279
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 1>being at the root of making the holiday season about material things rather than</v>

280
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 1>having young people remember the true meaning of Christmas.</v>

281
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Commercialism is a very real thing of course,</v>

282
00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>and there is no denying that Santa Claus has helped sell billions of dollars in</v>

283
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>products every holiday season from Coca Cola to Barbie dolls,</v>

284
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.200
<v Speaker 1>let's say no wells where religion and politics divide so many people.</v>

285
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 1>There are very few things that Americans agree on quite like the tradition of</v>

286
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.294
<v Speaker 1>Santa Clause.</v>

287
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Every December the 24th children go to bed and they wake up at the crack of</v>

288
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>dawn,</v>

289
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>hoping they will find presence underneath that Christmas tree.</v>

290
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:27.281
<v Speaker 1>For many.</v>

291
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the very few memories we all share rough.</v>

292
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Having faith in something and the experience of childhood wonder and it's the</v>

293
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 1>belief in magic,</v>

294
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it sends a close call and do everything by himself and he needs to</v>

295
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 1>recruit help in unexpected ways.</v>

296
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Just one example of this was in 2011 a young couple names,</v>

297
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Jim and Dylan moved into their new apartments on West 22nd street in New York</v>

298
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>

299
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Then they started to get letters in their mailbox address to Santa Claus.</v>

300
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>They thought it was a joke of course,</v>

301
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and they went to the post office to see if there was a forwarding address for</v>

302
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the previous tenants.</v>

303
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 1>They were told that yes there was,</v>

304
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 1>but it was simply push as the north pole that fast.</v>

305
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know what to do with these letters and they had no idea how these</v>

306
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 1>random children got their address.</v>

307
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>They even 30 such for why on Google.</v>

308
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Eventually they decided that they could not ignore these matters.</v>

309
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Many of them were heartbreaking matters that came from underprivileged children,</v>

310
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Dylan and jammed against you,</v>

311
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.660
<v Speaker 1>parse out letters to their friends and coworkers who all shared in the</v>

312
00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of buying presents for these kids.</v>

313
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough what spread on Facebook and they were able to get hundreds of</v>

314
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 1>letters fulfilled by kindhearted volunteers.</v>

315
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 1>They now run a charity called miracle on 22nd street where anyone can volunteer</v>

316
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 1>to help out with the letters to Santa.</v>

317
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 1>If you're still unconvinced in the existence of Santa Clause,</v>

318
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>there are few words that can better express the truth.</v>

319
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Then those are Francis for solace church.</v>

320
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>In 1997 and an eight year old girl named Virginia,</v>

321
00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 1>a Hanlon wrote to the New York Sun saying that I have friends in school told her</v>

322
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 1>that Santa Claus was not real.</v>

323
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Speaker 1>She asked the church to tell her the truth and they published this reply.</v>

324
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.181
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

325
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>

326
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 1>there is a Santa Claus.</v>

327
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 1>He exists is short or his generosity and devotion exists and you know their</v>

328
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:03.070
<v Speaker 1>bounds and give to your life.</v>

329
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It's highest beauty and joy.</v>

330
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Alas,</v>

331
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.530
<v Speaker 1>how dreary the world would be without to Santa Claus and just era biographics.</v>

332
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 1>We want to say that Santa Claus does exist as long as he's in our Haas and with</v>

333
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that very merry Christmas and happy holidays.</v>

334
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
