64
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:44.594
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

108
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Tutus as a man on the rise.</v>

109
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Following his graduation in 1916,</v>

114
00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:58.440
<v Speaker 1>it was clear that this Iraqi would never come to head the Chicano plan.</v>

115
00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.690
<v Speaker 1>picks up a penchant for gambling which he proved to be quite successful.</v>

142
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>In 1926,</v>

143
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>he was assigned to the United States for a second time where he stayed for two</v>

144
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>years as he rocky's two great passions combined in 1928 when he was given</v>

145
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:22.320
<v Speaker 1>command of the Imperial Navy's first aircraft carrier ecology.</v>

146
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>He retains this post for a little over a year.</v>

147
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.881
<v Speaker 1>Within that time,</v>

148
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:29.010
<v Speaker 1>he developed a strong bonds with the men under his command z grit.</v>

149
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>The tomorrow they're strict,</v>

150
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>but Faq Monda.</v>

151
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.871
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

152
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Rocky was mastery of the English language,</v>

153
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:43.350
<v Speaker 1>made him a valuable asset to the Japanese high command,</v>

154
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and in October of 1929,</v>

155
00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 1>he was stationed to London to act as an assistant to the Japanese delegation to</v>

156
00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:52.110
<v Speaker 1>the London Naval Conference of Nineteen 30.</v>

157
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 1>During his time in London,</v>

158
00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:57.450
<v Speaker 1>he received the news that he had been promoted to rear admiral back in Japan.</v>

159
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto was given yet another role within the imperial navy.</v>

160
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.100
<v Speaker 1>He became head of the technical division of the aeronautics department.</v>

161
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.001
<v Speaker 1>After three years,</v>

162
00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:08.490
<v Speaker 1>he then found himself back in command to the economy.</v>

163
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.350
<v Speaker 1>He threw himself into this role,</v>

164
00:07:10.351 --> 00:07:13.680
<v Speaker 1>disciplining and training as aviators with absolute precision.</v>

165
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:14.370
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

166
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>eight months into this role,</v>

167
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Speaker 1>he was again selected for service overseas.</v>

168
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.620
<v Speaker 1>The preliminary discussions for the second London naval conference took place in</v>

169
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:27.621
<v Speaker 1>London in October of 1934 and the gamma motor was selected as a chief delegate.</v>

170
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>He was tasked with pressing Japan's claim for a better naval construction ratio,</v>

171
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>which had previously been set at 60 percent of the battleship and carrier</v>

172
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 1>strength of the United States and Britain.</v>

173
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Despite his own personal misgivings,</v>

174
00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:42.570
<v Speaker 1>he proved to be the right man for the job.</v>

175
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.110
<v Speaker 1>His opposition negotiators from Britain and the US were impressed with his</v>

176
00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:48.090
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and his reasonableness.</v>

177
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 1>He put the demands from his government on the table which worth and naval parity</v>

178
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.940
<v Speaker 1>with the other two powers.</v>

179
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.690
<v Speaker 1>This was never going to be acceptable to the Brits and the Americans and</v>

180
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.593
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto.</v>

181
00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 1>He knew this,</v>

182
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 1>the negotiations.</v>

183
00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:04.440
<v Speaker 1>They went nowhere and the conference broke up without resolution even though we</v>

184
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 1>had not been able to achieve as government's ambitions.</v>

185
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Yamamotos prominence at the conference had made in internationally famous.</v>

186
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.270
<v Speaker 1>When he returned to Japan,</v>

187
00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:15.720
<v Speaker 1>he faced a period of stagnation which was very troubling to him.</v>

188
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:16.380
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

189
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.570
<v Speaker 1>he seriously considered at this point,</v>

190
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.100
<v Speaker 1>resigning from the navy.</v>

191
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Fun Kit was resolved though in December of 1935 when he was appointed chief of</v>

192
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 1>the aeronautics department at the Navy Ministry.</v>

193
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 1>He was now the boss of everything to do with naval aviation in Japan.</v>

194
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 1>This gave him the ability to put into development some of the concepts that he</v>

195
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:41.980
<v Speaker 1>had previously worked on.</v>

196
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>These included the type 96 land based attack plane.</v>

197
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.140
<v Speaker 1>This one's the most advanced attack plane possessed by any navy in the world and</v>

198
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:55.141
<v Speaker 1>would form a central part of Yamamotos offensive plans against the United</v>

199
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

200
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:55.831
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

201
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>on February the 26th,</v>

202
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

203
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.321
<v Speaker 1>36,</v>

204
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>there was an attempted military coup in Japan.</v>

205
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>The nationalistic governments placed Admiral Magonia Sama.</v>

206
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the new minister of the Navy Yamamoto excepted the position of vice</v>

207
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:08.761
<v Speaker 1>navy,</v>

208
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota.</v>

209
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>He sat about reinstilling,</v>

210
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>a lost discipline and the navy's command dismissing those who didn't meet the</v>

211
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

212
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>He also actively worked to prevent the army's push towards war.</v>

213
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 37 was to prove to be a key,</v>

214
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:30.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

215
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>in the advancement of Japan's war stance in the wake of starting a war on her</v>

216
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>doorstep with China.</v>

217
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>She signed a tripartite pact with Germany and definitely yellow.</v>

218
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Jay was against the pact and he wasn't shy about voicing his opinion.</v>

219
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 1>This brought him into increasing conflicts with the army administration and</v>

220
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>their right wing followers.</v>

221
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 1>He received numerous death threats.</v>

222
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>These didn't phase him and he appears to have accepted that sooner or later he</v>

223
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>would simply be assassinated.</v>

224
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>A crisis occurred in 1939.</v>

225
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>This was when the Germans signs a nonaggression pact with Russia,</v>

226
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>the traditional enemies of the Japanese.</v>

227
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>On August the 23rd,</v>

228
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>the entire Japanese cabinet resigned,</v>

229
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:13.710
<v Speaker 1>resulting in Yamamotos loss of his position as vice navy minister along with his</v>

230
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Superior Navy Minister Uni before leaving office.</v>

231
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:17.551
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

232
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know I had appointed Yamamoto as the commander in chief of the combined</v>

233
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 1>imperial fleet.</v>

234
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto was a highly experienced commander and to get the respect of his men,</v>

235
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>he was seen as a pacifist at a time when the country was marching towards war.</v>

236
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

237
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.510
<v Speaker 1>he threw himself into the position with his usual Gusto,</v>

238
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:41.400
<v Speaker 1>pushing aside his own reservations and stepping up training and preparation for</v>

239
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 1>the coming conflict.</v>

240
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 1940,</v>

241
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the pro German factions within the armed forces were driving the country towards</v>

242
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 1>a conflict with the United States,</v>

243
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>though personally opposed to taking on the use.</v>

244
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm the moto began planning for succession eventuality.</v>

245
00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>He was adamant that the only chance for success against America laying with a</v>

246
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>massive surprise attack that would take out the American fleet,</v>

247
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>followed up by the blitzkrieg like tactics that the Germans were using with such</v>

248
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.870
<v Speaker 1>positive effects in Europe.</v>

249
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It repeatedly stated that if a wall was to be one against the United States,</v>

250
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>it had to be completed within six months.</v>

251
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.191
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

252
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>the economic and manpower advantage of the Americans would inevitably prevailed.</v>

253
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>In July 19,</v>

254
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:23.701
<v Speaker 1>41,</v>

255
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>the United States responded to continue Japanese aggression in China by imposing</v>

256
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>a trade embargo on Japan and freezing all Japanese assets in its country,</v>

257
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Britain and the Netherlands.</v>

258
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 1>They quickly followed suit.</v>

259
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 1>The most crippling effect was the loss of oil imports,</v>

260
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:44.421
<v Speaker 1>which accounted for 90 percent of Japan's usage and of course the largest user</v>

261
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>of oil and the country was Japan's imperial navy.</v>

262
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.570
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese response was to further step up preparation for war while also</v>

263
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>looking to seize control of the oil reserves held in the Dutch east indies and</v>

264
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the British had in the Far East.</v>

265
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto believed that any attack on or British possessions withdraw the</v>

266
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Americans into an armed conflict.</v>

267
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.580
<v Speaker 1>It was at this time that Yamamoto formulated the plan for a decisive preemptive</v>

268
00:12:13.581 --> 00:12:17.270
<v Speaker 1>strike on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.</v>

269
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.410
<v Speaker 1>He believed that such a crushing blow would destroy American morale and lead to</v>

270
00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:22.970
<v Speaker 1>a negotiated peace settlement.</v>

271
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.360
<v Speaker 1>The plan was risky and many officials were opposed to it.</v>

272
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.410
<v Speaker 1>It's big volumes about Yamamoto is prestige and influence that he was able to</v>

273
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:32.840
<v Speaker 1>push the plan through to a final approval.</v>

274
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.460
<v Speaker 1>The plan was actually rejected by the navy general staff several times,</v>

275
00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:38.720
<v Speaker 1>but finally I'm a moto.</v>

276
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Had to put his foot down as long as he was commander in chief.</v>

277
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.960
<v Speaker 1>He called his command is the Pearl Harbor attack.</v>

278
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.913
<v Speaker 1>We'd go ahead.</v>

279
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.360
<v Speaker 1>He then went to the naval general staff and told them that unless the plan was</v>

280
00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>approved,</v>

281
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.870
<v Speaker 1>he and his entire staff would resign.</v>

282
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>The idea of going to war with out Yamamoto was a scary prospect to the navy bras</v>

283
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and they finally relented.</v>

284
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto is planned for Pearl Harbor,</v>

285
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>was to sink as many battleships as possible.</v>

286
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.460
<v Speaker 1>He sold the battleship as the symbol of American naval superiority and figured</v>

287
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:14.540
<v Speaker 1>that the sudden loss of the majority of that reserve would destroy the American</v>

288
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:15.374
<v Speaker 1>fighting spirit.</v>

289
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:15.951
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

290
00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 1>staff officer for the first athletes,</v>

291
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Granada,</v>

292
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:24.481
<v Speaker 1>I felt that it was more advantageous do concentrate on singing American aircraft</v>

293
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:25.310
<v Speaker 1>carriers.</v>

294
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.940
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

295
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.170
<v Speaker 1>a compromise was reached.</v>

296
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.280
<v Speaker 1>The first wave of the attack comprising of 40 torpedo planes would be directed</v>

297
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.810
<v Speaker 1>at two carriers.</v>

298
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.790
<v Speaker 1>The other 24 planes would focus on the eight battleships.</v>

299
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.520
<v Speaker 1>That could also potentially be that another 50 level Bowman's web to head for</v>

300
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.280
<v Speaker 1>battleship row where most of that or ships were expected to be buffed.</v>

301
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.971
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

302
00:13:43.971 --> 00:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>54 dive bombers were the escorting fighters were to attack the oil fields on a</v>

303
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Awahoo who the second wave of the attack was to comprise 81 dive bombers and was</v>

304
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:55.790
<v Speaker 1>intended to finish off the cruisers with their bombs being too small to damage</v>

305
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:56.630
<v Speaker 1>the battleships.</v>

306
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.510
<v Speaker 1>As it turned down to the attack during the early hours of December,</v>

307
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:00.021
<v Speaker 1>the seventh,</v>

308
00:14:00.021 --> 00:14:00.441
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

309
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:04.250
<v Speaker 1>41 was far more successful and it's targeting of battleships,</v>

310
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 1>cruises,</v>

311
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.190
<v Speaker 1>none of which were actually in the doc that day.</v>

312
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 1>The battleships so in West Virginia was sunk while the California was struck</v>

313
00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:15.230
<v Speaker 1>with two torpedoes eventually sinking and the Nevada with a single strike that</v>

314
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.430
<v Speaker 1>also brought her down.</v>

315
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.630
<v Speaker 1>All of this was achieved in only 11 minutes in battleship row.</v>

316
00:14:20.631 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 1>The Arizona was struck with a 1,760 pounds armor piercing,</v>

317
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.540
<v Speaker 1>bombed the forward magazine of the ship,</v>

318
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:27.200
<v Speaker 1>exploded,</v>

319
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.280
<v Speaker 1>killing 1000,</v>

320
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.690
<v Speaker 1>177 offices and creaming the attack was a complete success.</v>

321
00:14:32.691 --> 00:14:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Achieving Yamamotos objective of decimating American naval power in one fell</v>

322
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.060
<v Speaker 1>sweep.</v>

323
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>18 ships had been sunk or damaged while only 29 Japanese aircraft had been shot</v>

324
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:43.100
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

325
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Most pleasing dmr motor was that five battleships that either sunk or beached in</v>

326
00:14:48.381 --> 00:14:49.220
<v Speaker 1>the bigger picture of things.</v>

327
00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:49.521
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

328
00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 1>the attack at Pearl Harbor it achieved little yamamoto is emphasis on destroying</v>

329
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:54.201
<v Speaker 1>battleships.</v>

330
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It was not a sound policy.</v>

331
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>The Americans were already moving towards carriers rather than battleships and</v>

332
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 1>the Pearl Harbor attack merely sped up.</v>

333
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>This transition further more than rather than breaking American morale is</v>

334
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto had thought that the attack served as a rallying cry to drive the</v>

335
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>American zone.</v>

336
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Two final victory</v>

337
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.130
<v Speaker 1>with the United States Declaration of war against Japan on December the eighth,</v>

338
00:15:21.131 --> 00:15:21.521
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

339
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:22.330
<v Speaker 1>41.</v>

340
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.470
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese had to devise a strategy to overcome this far greater power.</v>

341
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.520
<v Speaker 1>It was decided to fight a defensive campaign where the Americans would be drawn</v>

342
00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:31.780
<v Speaker 1>into the Pacific eastern,</v>

343
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 1>worn down to the point of accepting a negotiated peace settlement.</v>

344
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:35.831
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

345
00:15:35.831 --> 00:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese would occupy key territories in the Asia Pacific moving down into</v>

346
00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Australasia or in the central Pacific,</v>

347
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Yemen military believe that when Singapore was taken,</v>

348
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.050
<v Speaker 1>the time would be right to sue for peace with the success of his brainchild,</v>

349
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.150
<v Speaker 1>the Pearl Harbor Attack Yamamotos influence group.</v>

350
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.930
<v Speaker 1>He was instrumental in planning invasions on Malaysia and the Philippines as</v>

351
00:15:55.931 --> 00:15:57.340
<v Speaker 1>well as Guam in Singapore.</v>

352
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.380
<v Speaker 1>In early February of 1942,</v>

353
00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:04.090
<v Speaker 1>he moved his staff headquarters onto the super battleship yamato with Singapore</v>

354
00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:04.841
<v Speaker 1>having fallen.</v>

355
00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto believed that it was time for his government to pressure the allies for</v>

356
00:16:08.411 --> 00:16:08.890
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>

357
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.700
<v Speaker 1>It's lack of action on this greatly frustrated him despite his conviction that</v>

358
00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:16.180
<v Speaker 1>our campaign that went for more than six months would be disastrous.</v>

359
00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>He was forced to plan out the next phase of the war.</v>

360
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.211
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

361
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>his ideas were at odds with the naval general staff who wanted to concentrate on</v>

362
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Australia where he was intent on taking control of the Indian subcontinent.</v>

363
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.450
<v Speaker 1>The army,</v>

364
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:28.900
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

365
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.230
<v Speaker 1>refused to back such a plan and it was quickly taken off the table.</v>

366
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.440
<v Speaker 1>The first major setback for the Japanese,</v>

367
00:16:40.441 --> 00:16:43.860
<v Speaker 1>the code with the battle of coral sea between may the fourth and the eighth,</v>

368
00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:44.760
<v Speaker 1>1942,</v>

369
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.180
<v Speaker 1>which successfully hold to the Japanese invasion of New Guinea.</v>

370
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

371
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:48.991
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

372
00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:52.800
<v Speaker 1>So we continue to butt heads with the naval general stuff as he now proposed an</v>

373
00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:57.270
<v Speaker 1>attack on Midway atoll that would draw out the remnants of the American fleet</v>

374
00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:58.104
<v Speaker 1>from Hawaii.</v>

375
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Wires could be utterly destroyed.</v>

376
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Resistance was stiff with general staff members pointing out the midway was too</v>

377
00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:07.320
<v Speaker 1>close to Pearl Harbor and too far away from Japan.</v>

378
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.370
<v Speaker 1>You have a motorcycle now used his old tactic of threatening to resign and you</v>

379
00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:12.510
<v Speaker 1>go his way again.</v>

380
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.790
<v Speaker 1>The attack on midway required Yamamoto,</v>

381
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.780
<v Speaker 1>two coordinators,</v>

382
00:17:15.781 --> 00:17:18.000
<v Speaker 1>fleets over huge stretches of water.</v>

383
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

384
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:18.781
<v Speaker 1>Moto,</v>

385
00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:19.231
<v Speaker 1>but board.</v>

386
00:17:19.231 --> 00:17:22.260
<v Speaker 1>The Yamato personally led one battle group and self.</v>

387
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.310
<v Speaker 1>What he didn't know was that the Americans had broken their secret codes and</v>

388
00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:29.580
<v Speaker 1>we're already aware of the attack and advance through us.</v>

389
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Carriers were sent to midway in order to surprise the Japanese.</v>

390
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.050
<v Speaker 1>In the ensuing battle,</v>

391
00:17:34.051 --> 00:17:37.590
<v Speaker 1>four Japanese carriers were sent to the bottom of the ocean acknowledging</v>

392
00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:38.070
<v Speaker 1>defeat.</v>

393
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto ordered his remaining ships back to base the defeat at midway,</v>

394
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.350
<v Speaker 1>was a humiliation for Yamamoto and see received much criticism for us still,</v>

395
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 1>he was able to retain his position as commander chief,</v>

396
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:53.730
<v Speaker 1>largely because to remove in would have been too demoralizing for the men under</v>

397
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:54.564
<v Speaker 1>his command.</v>

398
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Over the next few months,</v>

399
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese achieved limited success against the fleet around Guata canal in</v>

400
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 1>the Solomon Islands.</v>

401
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of Guadalcanal,</v>

402
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:02.431
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

403
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 1>was another crushing defeat for the Japanese</v>

404
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.060
<v Speaker 1>in the wake of Guadalcanal.</v>

405
00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Yamamoto set out on a morale boosting tour of af four spaces across the South</v>

406
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Pacific on April the 14th,</v>

407
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 1>1943 and message which announced his exact itinerary on route to a base in the</v>

408
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Solomon Islands was intercepted by US intelligence.</v>

409
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.230
<v Speaker 1>This presented the Americans with the perfect opportunity,</v>

410
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.560
<v Speaker 1>do assassinate the Japanese naval commander in chief.</v>

411
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.430
<v Speaker 1>It was a risk and that it would portray the Americans' ability to break Japanese</v>

412
00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:36.761
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

413
00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:40.720
<v Speaker 1>but Yamamoto was seen as such a big fish that it was deemed worth giving up.</v>

414
00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:41.680
<v Speaker 1>This intelligence,</v>

415
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.311
<v Speaker 1>a plan,</v>

416
00:18:42.311 --> 00:18:43.300
<v Speaker 1>nicknames operation.</v>

417
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Vengeance was put into operation with the objective of killing Yamamoto.</v>

418
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.820
<v Speaker 1>18 US fighter pilots were chosen from the base at Guadalcanal to participate in</v>

419
00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:52.570
<v Speaker 1>the operation.</v>

420
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 1>14 of them would provide cover at around 20,000 feet while for others for them</v>

421
00:18:56.431 --> 00:19:00.460
<v Speaker 1>to a strikeforce to blow yamamotos plane right out of the sky.</v>

422
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.620
<v Speaker 1>The attack it was set for April the 18th that morning that was not one but two</v>

423
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>m,</v>

424
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.970
<v Speaker 1>one type one betty bombers along with six a six,</v>

425
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.220
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

426
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.250
<v Speaker 1>zero five just to provide escort and yamamotos fleet.</v>

427
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.090
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't long into the flight when the four American p 38 swept seen</v>

428
00:19:16.091 --> 00:19:19.960
<v Speaker 1>approaching the bomber that was carrying Emma Moto immediately began to descend</v>

429
00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:22.090
<v Speaker 1>while the escort planes moved into intercept,</v>

430
00:19:22.091 --> 00:19:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the Americans bombed so they weren't able to prevent the [inaudible] from</v>

431
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.980
<v Speaker 1>achieving their objectives.</v>

432
00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:29.290
<v Speaker 1>With both of the betty bombers receiving strikes,</v>

433
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.700
<v Speaker 1>both of the planes crashed.</v>

434
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.241
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

435
00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:34.840
<v Speaker 1>an autopsy on his body revealed that Yamamoto who was sitting on the starboard</v>

436
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:38.230
<v Speaker 1>side of the plane behind the plane commander had been struck by bullets to the</v>

437
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:41.920
<v Speaker 1>drawer and shoulder and was probably dead before the plane hit the grounds.</v>

438
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Yamamotos body was found later that day.</v>

439
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It had been thrown from the wreckage,</v>

440
00:19:46.121 --> 00:19:47.380
<v Speaker 1>still strapped to the seat.</v>

441
00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.520
<v Speaker 1>The death of Yamamoto was not revealed to the Japanese people until may the 20,</v>

442
00:19:51.521 --> 00:19:54.130
<v Speaker 1>fast more than a month after he was shot down,</v>

443
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.960
<v Speaker 1>more than a million people lined the streets of Tokyo as his ashes passed by.</v>

444
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.690
<v Speaker 1>So today's video was made possible by audible,</v>

445
00:20:01.691 --> 00:20:04.360
<v Speaker 1>who I'm sure many of you know about already.</v>

446
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I've been a longtime customer of audible reading tons of books on all sorts of</v>

447
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:09.250
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>

448
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:09.551
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

449
00:20:09.551 --> 00:20:10.510
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a funny story.</v>

450
00:20:10.511 --> 00:20:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I personally really love autobiographies and biographies and listening to those</v>

451
00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:15.244
<v Speaker 1>three audible.</v>

452
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I was actually inspired me to stop this channel.</v>

453
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:18.611
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

454
00:20:18.611 --> 00:20:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It all kind of came full circle,</v>

455
00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:21.460
<v Speaker 1>so thanks for that order bulk.</v>

456
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.210
<v Speaker 1>There are loads of autobiographies on audible and I bet that if it's a notable</v>

457
00:20:25.211 --> 00:20:25.421
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

458
00:20:25.421 --> 00:20:27.880
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a cool audiobook version of it as well.</v>

459
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Also related to this video,</v>

460
00:20:29.171 --> 00:20:31.150
<v Speaker 1>there are tons of audio books on World War Two,</v>

461
00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:32.170
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific theater,</v>

462
00:20:32.171 --> 00:20:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Pearl Harbor itself.</v>

463
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Lots and lots of those.</v>

464
00:20:34.721 --> 00:20:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I just did a quick search and the entire first page of results are all super</v>

465

<v Speaker 1>highly rated books about this attack and its consequences.</v>

466
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.111

<v Speaker 1>what about was always a good deal and you'd go into an audio book a month for a</v>
