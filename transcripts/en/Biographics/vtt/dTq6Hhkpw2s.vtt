<v Speaker 1>or pulled the second ruled over Belgium from 1865 to 1909 today.</v>

5
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>The memory of his reign still lives on and he is glorified with golden statues</v>

6
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>of his likeness in every major city in Belgium.</v>

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.703
<v Speaker 1>In history class,</v>

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>each generation is taught that he was a humanitarian.</v>

9
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>He brought Christianity and the wonders of civilizations of the Congo Free</v>

10
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>State.</v>

11
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

12
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>the truth has been kept away from the Belgium people.</v>

13
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>The reality is the king Leopold.</v>

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>The second is responsible for the murder and mutilation of 10 million Congolese</v>

15
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

16
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>In the video today we're looking at what might just be the biggest cover up in</v>

17
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>European history.</v>

18
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Leopold.</v>

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>The second was born in 1835 to king Leopold the first and is Luisa.</v>

20
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Maria Volley on.</v>

21
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>They were the very first role family of Belgium because the country,</v>

22
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it was just five years old for thousands of years.</v>

23
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>That territory had been conquered by nearby the Netherlands,</v>

24
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:12.991
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

25
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:13.411
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

26
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>and Luxembourg.</v>

27
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>They were a newly independent country.</v>

28
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>There's had to get to form a unique national identity.</v>

29
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.651
<v Speaker 1>Leopold,</v>

30
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the seconds had two younger siblings called Felipe and Charlotte.</v>

31
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Their family life was dysfunctional to say the least.</v>

32
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Soon after Charlotte's birth in 1844 king Leopold,</v>

33
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>the first metric at 16 year old girl named [inaudible].</v>

34
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>He was 54 years old at the time,</v>

35
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't stop him from having an affair with a teenage girl.</v>

36
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Clarence would go on to become a barren s and her son's George and Arthur were</v>

37
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>made into barons.</v>

38
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>They weren't rumors that the uphold the first ad to several other affairs,</v>

39
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>so the exact number of half siblings that the appalled.</v>

40
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>The second has is actually a known Queen Louise.</v>

41
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Maria was understandably miserable in a marriage and she chose to let out her</v>

42
00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>anger on her children.</v>

43
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>She would make fun of young Leopold.</v>

44
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>The second's large knows that he inherited from his father.</v>

45
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>She told her son that his face was disfigured and that he had the beak of a bird</v>

46
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>in 1853 when he was 18 years old,</v>

47
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Leopold the second had an arranged marriage with Marie Henry out of Austria</v>

48
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>since he had never actually seen what a loving marriage looks like.</v>

49
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>The team couple were incredibly awkward around one another.</v>

50
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Someone in the Belgium rock ought had commented that seeing them together,</v>

51
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>it was like watching a nun and the stable boy people thought the best was so</v>

52
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>hilariously accurate that the phrase was repeated amongst everyone who knew</v>

53
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

54
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Apparently his parents cad so less about Leopold that they never even bothered</v>

55
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>to tell them about the birds and the bees.</v>

56
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.071
<v Speaker 1>They're polled Zealand.</v>

57
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Queen Victoria of England had a great marriage with our husbands,</v>

58
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Albert and she apparently gave her nephew a lot of sacs advice.</v>

59
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>This was probably just as awkward as you are right now in engineering.</v>

60
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>They uphold the seconds and Marie Henry as eventually figured it out because</v>

61
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Speaker 1>they managed to have two daughters together.</v>

62
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.630
<v Speaker 1>When Leopold the first dies in 1865 Leopold the seconds ascended the throne as</v>

63
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>the new king of Belgium.</v>

64
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Since this personal life was so dysfunctional,</v>

65
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it's really no surprise that his happiness and satisfaction came from attaining</v>

66
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>material thinks according to William the second the ruler of Germany,</v>

67
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>he was together watching a parade with Leopold the second in Berlin when he</v>

68
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>called and said there is really nothing left for us king's except money.</v>

69
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.091
<v Speaker 1>Before he died,</v>

70
00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:30.290
<v Speaker 1>king Leopold the seconds father and made 50 attempts to conquer a colony for</v>

71
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>

72
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but he always failed.</v>

73
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It was clear to him that the power of other countries like England,</v>

74
00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

75
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.021
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

76
00:03:36.021 --> 00:03:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and the United States was thanks to colonization there pulled the first belief</v>

77
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that without colonizing an African nation,</v>

78
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.620
<v Speaker 1>they would never be considered one of the world's larger powers.</v>

79
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.191
<v Speaker 1>Leopold,</v>

80
00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>the second's picked up where his father left off,</v>

81
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but he did not want to conquer a nation on behalf of Belgium.</v>

82
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>He blends to make an entire country is personal property.</v>

83
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.220
<v Speaker 1>This way he could have complete control and to have direct access to the</v>

84
00:03:58.221 --> 00:03:59.030
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>

85
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>He knew that if he was honest about his greedy intentions,</v>

86
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.200
<v Speaker 1>none of the other major powers would agree to last him colonize an entire</v>

87
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>country for himself,</v>

88
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.880
<v Speaker 1>so he simply told everyone that it was his mission to spread Christianity,</v>

89
00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 1>do the Congo.</v>

90
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to convert and civilize.</v>

91
00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.850
<v Speaker 1>There's poor godless souls.</v>

92
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>In 1884 he met with 14 other European nations at the Berlin conference.</v>

93
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.310
<v Speaker 1>He pitched his idea for colonizing the Congo and cleaned that he wanted to spend</v>

94
00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>his own fortune bringing missionaries to Africa out of the goodness of his own</v>

95
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

96
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.340
<v Speaker 1>He also promised the rest of Europe that they could freely explore and trade</v>

97
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 1>with his country.</v>

98
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.841
<v Speaker 1>The Congo,</v>

99
00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>though it was known for being incredibly dangerous and difficult to colonize the</v>

100
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>rain forest and Savannah,</v>

101
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.230
<v Speaker 1>they're filled with gorillas,</v>

102
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:42.741
<v Speaker 1>lions,</v>

103
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>leopards and wolves.</v>

104
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 1>The Congo river has Manny's in crocodiles and hippopotamuses as well as insects</v>

105
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>that carry deadly diseases in general.</v>

106
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a very wild place and not many Europeans exactly wanted to go out there</v>

107
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and live.</v>

108
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.960
<v Speaker 1>If they're bought the second one you to go and take on the challenge.</v>

109
00:04:56.961 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 1>The other powers were pretty much willing to say,</v>

110
00:04:58.821 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.080
<v Speaker 1>go on then.</v>

112
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

113
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:00.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:02.600
<v Speaker 1>she explorer in journalist named Henry Morgan.</v>

115
00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Stanley already had years of experience in Africa.</v>

116
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 1>He was sent on projects by several different newspapers in the United Kingdom</v>

117
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and he became an expert on the continents.</v>

118
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.161
<v Speaker 1>Through his writing,</v>

119
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:17.480
<v Speaker 1>he tried to convince Queen Victoria that despite all of the difficulty he</v>

120
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:20.750
<v Speaker 1>believed it would be worthwhile to colonize the Congo.</v>

121
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's suggestions and ever made any impact until king Leopold.</v>

122
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:26.510
<v Speaker 1>The seconds found his work.</v>

123
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 1>In 1879 the king sent him on a mission to colonize the Congo.</v>

124
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Henry Martin Stanley used parlor tricks.</v>

125
00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you convince the African tribal chiefs that white men were invincible?</v>

126
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.030
<v Speaker 1>He used a battery powered contraptions and makers grips so strong that Congolese</v>

127
00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 1>men almost collapsed from a single handshake.</v>

128
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.991
<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>

129
00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>claims that white men could wrap a tree out of the grounds with their bare</v>

130
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

131
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 1>He also held a magnifying glass in the sunlight and use the sun's rays to light</v>

132
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:54.291
<v Speaker 1>a cigar,</v>

133
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>claiming that to man had power over the sun.</v>

134
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

135
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>he handed the gun to a need of men.</v>

136
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>He instructed him to step back several yards and try to shoot him sounded he had</v>

137
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>taken the gunpowder and bullets out beforehand,</v>

138
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:06.381
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

139
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's when the young man build the trigger.</v>

140
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Stanley would double over dramatically only to take his shoe off and shake the</v>

141
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>bullet out onto the grounds.</v>

142
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>He claims that white men were spirits who could not be killed and no matter how</v>

143
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>hard they it and the two bullets which simply pass right through them.</v>

144
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>This was enough to terrify the chiefs into signing a contract which declared</v>

145
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>king Leopold the seconds for new owner of the Congo.</v>

146
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.921
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

147
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>the Congolese people had no idea what the contract actually says,</v>

148
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>but it served as a legal document in the eyes of the European people.</v>

149
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.241
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

150
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Leopold's wants to keep up an image that he was doing good in the country,</v>

151
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>so he named it the Congo Free State.</v>

152
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Henry Morgan Stanley published a book about his journey through Africa called</v>

153
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>through the dark continent.</v>

154
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>He was able to go on a lecture tour around London and he was even knighted in</v>

155
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 1>1899</v>

156
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Leopold the second Trudy was paying for all of the startup expenses do colonize</v>

157
00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the Congo out of his own pockets.</v>

158
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 1>He appointed governor generals to manage the various territories of the country.</v>

159
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Leopold's men eventually discovered that the rain forest had a plentiful supply</v>

160
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 1>of rubber trees.</v>

161
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.940
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

162
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 1>it was essentially like stumbling across a gold mine.</v>

163
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.971
<v Speaker 1>At the time.</v>

164
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 1>There was a huge demand for natural rubber in order to make tires,</v>

165
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:21.070
<v Speaker 1>but there was a very small supply.</v>

166
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.240
<v Speaker 1>The only problem of course,</v>

167
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:27.241
<v Speaker 1>was finding a way to pay for all of the manual labor required the bolder</v>

168
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.430
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

169
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>he ordered his men to enslave the Congolese people.</v>

171
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Each of the governor general's had their own tactic to achieve this.</v>

172
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Usually they set a village on fire so that there was no worth anyone's a height.</v>

173
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>They would shoot and capture women of the village and tell them that if they did</v>

174
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>not bring back 15 kilograms of rubber,</v>

175
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:44.770
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the day,</v>

176
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>they would kill their wives and daughters.</v>

177
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>The Congo free state was anything but free.</v>

178
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.800
<v Speaker 1>King Leopold.</v>

179
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.040
<v Speaker 1>The second believe that all of these people were his personal slaves and he</v>

180
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.870
<v Speaker 1>could do whatever he wanted with them.</v>

181
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.160
<v Speaker 1>King Leopold passenger,</v>

182
00:07:57.161 --> 00:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>he handed out bonuses to the commanders if they could produce more rubber by any</v>

183
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>means necessary.</v>

184
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Leopold's began to grow his own private army in the Congo called the force</v>

185
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>publique.</v>

186
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>When his men were destroying villages,</v>

187
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 1>they would pick out the tool list and strongest young men to recruit as</v>

188
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

189
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.620
<v Speaker 1>These soldiers were instructors do systematically kill anyone who disobeyed the</v>

190
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:19.120
<v Speaker 1>orders of the governor generals.</v>

191
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 1>They were told to not waste any ammunition and that they must kill a man with a</v>

192
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:23.740
<v Speaker 1>single bullet.</v>

193
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 1>They were required to bring back one severed hand for every bullet fired.</v>

194
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.533
<v Speaker 1>If they did not,</v>

195
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.370
<v Speaker 1>they would be killed by that general.</v>

196
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.550
<v Speaker 1>This led to the soldiers cutting off hands of people that were still alive</v>

197
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.380
<v Speaker 1>whenever they wasted ammunition.</v>

198
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.011
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

199
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:36.431
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>

200
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>people have no idea what was actually going on.</v>

201
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Word got around that King Leopold,</v>

202
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:42.790
<v Speaker 1>the second neater more soldiers to help with his Christian missions.</v>

203
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:44.230
<v Speaker 1>You colonize the Congo,</v>

204
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of young men from Belgium,</v>

205
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.391
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>

206
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:46.781
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>

207
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:47.231
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

208
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:47.771
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>

209
00:08:47.771 --> 00:08:49.690
<v Speaker 1>they all signed up to join the force.</v>

210
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Publique.</v>

211
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.980
<v Speaker 1>They were taught that these black natives worth animals and not fully human like</v>

212
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:54.221
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

213
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>so they shouldn't guilty about killing them whenever necessary.</v>

214
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.291
<v Speaker 1>After a while,</v>

215
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.041
<v Speaker 1>these men,</v>

216
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>they became desensitized to the killing.</v>

217
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Some of these soldiers would Gus people learns,</v>

218
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>pull out that end trails or slice off a group of men's genitalia only to hang</v>

219
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>them in a row.</v>

220
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of the Governor General's right,</v>

221
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>that is to King Leopold.</v>

222
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>The second about the scenes because they were actually proud of their brutality.</v>

223
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>They believed that the worst they treated the Congolese people,</v>

224
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 1>the harder they worked.</v>

225
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Overtime King Leopold's men managed to enslave the entire population of the</v>

226
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>country even though we'd promise that the rest of the world could visit the</v>

227
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Congo whenever they want.</v>

228
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Since King Leopold,</v>

229
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>the second's became very nervous when he learned that Arabian merchants were</v>

230
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.180
<v Speaker 1>coming together,</v>

231
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 1>some rubber for themselves.</v>

232
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>He did not want to lose his monopoly over the industry,</v>

233
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 1>so he declared that they needed to go to war with these so called Arab slave</v>

234
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>traders,</v>

235
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>which would free the Congolese people.</v>

236
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.581
<v Speaker 1>The sparks,</v>

237
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>the two year Congo,</v>

238
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Arab war and 95 and English merchant named Charles Stokes was on a mission for</v>

239
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>the Germans do travel to the Congo to purchase.</v>

240
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Rather,</v>

241
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>he was hung by the force Republique with out receiving a trial,</v>

242
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Britain,</v>

243
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they were outraged that he was killed without ever committing any crime.</v>

244
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>The of Holt was forced to pay substantial fines to both governments for</v>

245
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 1>violating the treaty,</v>

246
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>and the incident was cooled.</v>

247
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>The stokes Afaf,</v>

248
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.211
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

249
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 1>paying this fine,</v>

250
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>it was a drop in the bucket.</v>

251
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>King Leopold the second made a profit of 220 million francs,</v>

252
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>which would be worth more than a billion dollars today</v>

253
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.150
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>

254
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 1>The second time,</v>

255
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.310
<v Speaker 1>the team of propaganda writers to publish books and articles about what a great</v>

256
00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:31.144
<v Speaker 1>job he was doing.</v>

257
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.840
<v Speaker 1>None of these writers had ever actually traveled to the Congo free stage,</v>

258
00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>but they were happy to glorify their kings,</v>

259
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:37.541
<v Speaker 1>Christy,</v>

260
00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and mission.</v>

261
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.500
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

262
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.810
<v Speaker 1>journalists from Great Britain and the United States were beginning to travels</v>

263
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the Congo Free State and report on what they saw in the air.</v>

264
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.450
<v Speaker 1>As in 19 Americans have a war veteran named George Washington Williams visited</v>

265
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:52.060
<v Speaker 1>the Congo Free State and he was horrified.</v>

266
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 1>He wrote an open letter to King Leopold.</v>

267
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.490
<v Speaker 1>The seconds are counting the horrors that he witnessed while visiting the</v>

268
00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:58.324
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

269
00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.193
<v Speaker 1>The king,</v>

270
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.280
<v Speaker 1>he never replied.</v>

271
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.970
<v Speaker 1>A man named Edelman's Denny moral worked as a clerk at a shipping firm in</v>

272
00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:04.331
<v Speaker 1>Liverpool.</v>

273
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Linkedin's Belgium ships would come and go delivering rubber to Liverpool from</v>

274
00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:12.700
<v Speaker 1>the Congo mural knew that it wouldn't be possible for Belgium to produce such a</v>

275
00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:16.120
<v Speaker 1>high volume of rubber and less they were using slave labor.</v>

276
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>He began investigating and when he discovered the horizontal,</v>

277
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.200
<v Speaker 1>what was actually happening,</v>

278
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:23.860
<v Speaker 1>he wrote several anonymous articles for a British newspaper called the speaker</v>

279
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.290
<v Speaker 1>exposing the truth about what he saw.</v>

280
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:26.950
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>

281
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>this was the greatest crime that has ever been committed in the history of the</v>

282
00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:33.424
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

283
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.300
<v Speaker 1>In 1901 the shipping company offered moral a job to manage the shipments of</v>

284
00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 1>rubber to and from the Congo.</v>

285
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.120
<v Speaker 1>They were willing to pay him a huge salary in exchange for his silence.</v>

286
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.660
<v Speaker 1>He turned it down and became a full time journalist and stat.</v>

287
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It became so passionate about the cause that he began publishing his own</v>

288
00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:50.441
<v Speaker 1>newspaper,</v>

289
00:11:50.441 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 1>called the west African male with any new information he founds.</v>

290
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.890
<v Speaker 1>In 1906 he published a book called Red Rubber and other journalists name's Roger</v>

291
00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.081
<v Speaker 1>Casement,</v>

292
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>was sent to interview people of the Congo to get their testimonies about the</v>

293
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>human rights abuses in the country.</v>

294
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>He realized that it was crucial to convince the White Christian missionaries to</v>

295
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>come forward with their stories because they had been there from the beginning</v>

296
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>and they could prove that king Leopold.</v>

297
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>The second was aware of the atrocities after Roger casements report was</v>

298
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:17.201
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>

299
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:17.741
<v Speaker 1>King Leopold,</v>

300
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the second he knew that if he did not respond with his own inquiry,</v>

301
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>this would be the end of him.</v>

302
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.420
<v Speaker 1>He sent his own international commission to the Congo in the hopes that he could</v>

303
00:12:25.421 --> 00:12:26.170
<v Speaker 1>bribe them.</v>

304
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>He thought that he could pay them off to publish whatever he wanted them to say,</v>

305
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 1>but this totally backfired and Christy and missionary named John Harris had been</v>

306
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 1>living in the Congo Free State for years.</v>

307
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>He and his wife devoted their lives to helping me,</v>

308
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Congolese people.</v>

309
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 1>When King Leopold's international commission showed up,</v>

310
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>John Harris was ready for them.</v>

311
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 1>He gathers a group of Congolese people who testified to the death,</v>

312
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 1>torture,</v>

313
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>mutilation,</v>

314
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 1>rape,</v>

315
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>and then save them that they suffered at the hands of the king.</v>

316
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 1>His wife,</v>

317
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.351
<v Speaker 1>Alice Harris,</v>

318
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>was a photographer and she was able to present them with photographic evidence</v>

319
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.080
<v Speaker 1>of the horse that they had seen.</v>

320
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>When the international commission returned to Belgium,</v>

321
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:04.930
<v Speaker 1>they published a 50 page report on all the human rights abuses that they had</v>

322
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:05.920
<v Speaker 1>found in the Congo.</v>

323
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>They submitted it to king there,</v>

324
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

325
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the seconds once he realized that he could no longer get away with his lies,</v>

326
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Leopold audit,</v>

327
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>all of the Congo free state records to be burned so that there would be no</v>

328
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 1>evidence of his crimes.</v>

329
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.230
<v Speaker 1>In 19 eight the Congo became a Belgium colony,</v>

330
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't seize it from the king.</v>

331
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.601
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

332
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>they paid him 50 million francs for the purchase.</v>

333
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.130
<v Speaker 1>He dies just one year later in 1909</v>

334
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.350
<v Speaker 1>once the Belgium government visited the Congo,</v>

335
00:13:36.351 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 1>they found far more profitable resources than just rubber.</v>

336
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.550
<v Speaker 1>They were diamonds,</v>

337
00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:40.971
<v Speaker 1>gold,</v>

338
00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and ivory that could be sold for massive profits.</v>

339
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.600
<v Speaker 1>The government ended slavery and employed the Congolese people to work for wages</v>

340
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.110
<v Speaker 1>instead very soon after Belgium became extremely wealthy,</v>

341
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the city of Brussels.</v>

342
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Now some of the most breathtaking architecture in the world is complete with</v>

343
00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:56.810
<v Speaker 1>golden statues of King Leopold.</v>

344
00:13:56.811 --> 00:13:57.590
<v Speaker 1>The seconds,</v>

345
00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.290
<v Speaker 1>all because of the money that he brought from the Congo,</v>

346
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but the Belgium government,</v>

347
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.900
<v Speaker 1>they had to make a decision.</v>

348
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.370
<v Speaker 1>What do they tell if a public Leopold the second line to his people for a long</v>

349
00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:10.640
<v Speaker 1>time and they looked up to him like a father figure who brought glory to the</v>

350
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:11.400
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

351
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Not only would the citizens be disappointed,</v>

352
00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:16.280
<v Speaker 1>but it would make Belgium look terrible to the outside world.</v>

353
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Their nation was still less than a hundred years old at the time.</v>

354
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.240
<v Speaker 1>England in the United States had already outlawed slavery in the 18 hundreds so</v>

355
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.440
<v Speaker 1>the king of Belgium had essentially taken a big step backwards in humanitarian</v>

356
00:14:27.441 --> 00:14:28.160
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

357
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.820
<v Speaker 1>The Belgium government chose to allow their people to continue believing the lie</v>

358
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.250
<v Speaker 1>that King Leopold the second to built for himself,</v>

359
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.370
<v Speaker 1>they taught their children that there was never any slavery in the Congo.</v>

360
00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Free stays in that everything king Leopold.</v>

361
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.940
<v Speaker 1>The second did was wonderful.</v>

362
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.790
<v Speaker 1>This lie was retold generation after generation,</v>

363
00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:48.110
<v Speaker 1>so the point we're at became then you truth and part of that cultural identity.</v>

364
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Before his death in 1897 the apple of the created a human zoo at his summer</v>

365
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>

366
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>He bolts and muddle African village and captured to 267 Congolese people to live</v>

367
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:02.900
<v Speaker 1>that Belgium people showed up to Gawk at them throwing peanuts and bananas over</v>

368
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 1>the fence as if they were monkeys.</v>

369
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 1>They were forced to stay outdoors in this village and all kinds of weather.</v>

370
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Several of those people dying of influenza and pneumonia after he died to the</v>

371
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.610
<v Speaker 1>king's estates became the Royal Museum of Central Africa and to continue to</v>

372
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:17.690
<v Speaker 1>glorify Leopold.</v>

373
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>The seconds achievements in colonization decades after his death in 1958 the</v>

374
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:26.270
<v Speaker 1>governments of Belgium even went as far as to replicate is human zoo at the</v>

375
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Brussels welfare,</v>

376
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>putting Congolese people on display like animals.</v>

377
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.483
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

378
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 1>nearly every western nation has some history of slavery and genocide,</v>

379
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but in most Belgian school classes they will never have the truth about king</v>

380
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:39.471
<v Speaker 1>Leopold.</v>

381
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 1>The seconds they will say that slavery never happened in the Congo since the</v>

382
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 1>records were destroyed.</v>

383
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>We will never know just to many people,</v>

384
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Leopold was responsible for killing some estimate that it is roughly 4 million</v>

385
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:56.350
<v Speaker 1>while others believe it is as high as 10 somewhere between 70 to 90% of the</v>

386
00:15:57.021 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>total population was wiped out in the age of the Internet.</v>

387
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

388
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.280
<v Speaker 1>It become much more difficult for Belgium to ignore the reality of what happens.</v>

389
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.080
<v Speaker 1>In 2018 the curators of the Royal Museum of Central Africa finally decided to</v>

390
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>change the exhibits to honor the lives lost by the native Congolese people.</v>

391
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.941
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

392
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Congolese people who've visited the exhibits said that it is still not enough</v>

393
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 1>and that as long as the story is told from the perspective of a Belgium white</v>

394
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

395
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.970
<v Speaker 1>the country will never show you the full truth about the monstrous deeds of King</v>

396
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:26.421
<v Speaker 1>Leopold.</v>

397
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:27.254
<v Speaker 1>The seconds.</v>

398
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 1>So in some way the Internet has become an incredible way for smaller voices to</v>
