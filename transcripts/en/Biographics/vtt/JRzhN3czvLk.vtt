00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Two things before we get started today.</v>

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.431
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

3
00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>they're all weird pronunciations in this one.</v>

4
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking them up when I can.</v>

5
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I have a laptop right here.</v>

6
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it doesn't exist.</v>

7
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're just owned the pronunciations available.</v>

8
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.363
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my best,</v>

9
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but have a good.</v>

10
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the comments if you want.</v>

11
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:13.764

18
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.361
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

19
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>so for three years and eight months,</v>

20
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Pol Pot ruled over Cambodia with an iron fist.</v>

21
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>The legacy that he left his horrific millions of families were torn apart.</v>

22
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of thousands were terribly tortured and one point 7 million of his own</v>

23
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>people will put to death.</v>

24
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>So how did it end this way?</v>

25
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 1>On this week's biographics,</v>

26
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>we attempt to see.</v>

27
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:48.134
<v Speaker 1>Colin says,</v>

28
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>as we delve into the life of Pol Pot,</v>

29
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>the man who the world would come to know was polled.</v>

30
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Part was born Sar on January the 25th,</v>

31
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.541
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

32
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:14.541
<v Speaker 1>25 in the small village of praxis in Cambodia is was a peasant family and from</v>

33
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>an early age he found himself working long hours in the rice fields.</v>

34
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>The selloff Klan were better off than many being landowners who worked that own</v>

35
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:24.024
<v Speaker 1>rice fields,</v>

36
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.873
<v Speaker 1>saw his father,</v>

37
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>owns nine hashtags and would employ local workers at harvest time.</v>

38
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.120
<v Speaker 1>His mother saw him was a devoutly religious woman who brought up her children as</v>

39
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Theravada Buddhists.</v>

40
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Saul was the second to youngest of nine children,</v>

41
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

42
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>three of them died early according to his brother and A.</v>

43
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Saul was a considerate,</v>

44
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>kind and hard working child.</v>

45
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.091
<v Speaker 1>During the day,</v>

46
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>he and his brothers would work in the fields,</v>

47
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>then play in the rivers and on the outskirts of the jungle.</v>

48
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.551
<v Speaker 1>In the evening,</v>

49
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>they would gather around and open,</v>

50
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>fire and sing the teachings and histories of a local religious leader.</v>

51
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>For the vast majority of Railroad Cambodians,</v>

52
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>life revolved around the rice fields in the village.</v>

53
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever traveled to beyond the borders of their birthplace,</v>

54
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.703
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

55
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>wanted his sons to experience more from life.</v>

56
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So when he was six,</v>

57
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Sar and his older brother was sent to the Cambodian capital,</v>

58
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Phnom Penh loft had a cousin by the name of me who was employed as a consort to</v>

59
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>the king of Cambodia,</v>

60
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>and the boys were sent to live with him,</v>

61
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>no longer considered as peasants sergeant,</v>

62
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>his brother well now among the privileged.</v>

63
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.341
<v Speaker 1>As such,</v>

64
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>they were educated by the French.</v>

65
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Colonial rule is in a school where the teaching was done in the French language,</v>

66
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>saw studied French literature and history,</v>

67
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>filling his head with the events of the 1789 French revolution and the reign of</v>

68
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>terror that followed under the orchestration of Maximilian Robespierre.</v>

69
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Former school names rather than saw was there quiet,</v>

70
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>introspective young man who kept his thoughts to himself.</v>

71
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>He was an average student at best apparently being held back two years.</v>

72
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Most of his classmates were the children of French officials or Catholic</v>

73
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:54.654
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese.</v>

74
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia was officially a monarchy,</v>

75
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:57.984
<v Speaker 1>but the king,</v>

76
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>he ruled in name only with the real power lying with the French colonial</v>

77
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

78
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>At this time,</v>

79
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>the French were tied up in a bit of a struggle to hold onto their power in</v>

80
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.120
<v Speaker 1>neighboring Vietnam bad.</v>

81
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>The Communist army under Ho Ci Minh was leading the struggle for independence,</v>

82
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnamese revolutionaries that started to train small groups of Cambodians</v>

83
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and infuse them with the desire for independence from this European rule.</v>

84
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.850
<v Speaker 1>This was a movement that was spreading throughout all of India,</v>

85
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>China at this time,</v>

86
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>at the age of 28,</v>

87
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>so traveled with some friends on a pilgrimage to the famous temples at Angkor</v>

88
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Wat.</v>

89
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>This site was the rallying point for Cambodian nationalistic pride.</v>

90
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>The trip left a lasting impression on the young men in 1970,</v>

91
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:48.114
<v Speaker 1>70 status.</v>

92
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 1>If our people could build ankle wash,</v>

93
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 1>they could do anything we must revive on national soul and pride in order to</v>

94
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Speaker 1>defend the nation bills the country well then preserve it forever.</v>

95
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>The trip mocks the awakening of saws,</v>

96
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>political consciousness,</v>

97
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>and his drawing for independence.</v>

98
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 1>In 1947,</v>

99
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 1>he passed the exams and gained entrance into the Cecil was author secondary</v>

100
00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:11.850
<v Speaker 1>college and Phnom Penh,</v>

101
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.070
<v Speaker 1>but the following year he failed the entry exam into the upper classes and he</v>

102
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>had to leave the school with his academic career seemingly at a standstill.</v>

103
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>He began to study carpentry.</v>

104
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1949,</v>

105
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 1>do you want a scholarship to study at an elite engineering school in Paris?</v>

106
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 1>For the first few months,</v>

107
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 1>he indulged in the excesses that Parisians social life had to offer.</v>

108
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>This thing's changed when he came into contact with some fellow Cambodian,</v>

109
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>so you had views that builds upon the spark of nationalist pride that had been</v>

110
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>ignited at Angkor Wat.</v>

111
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>The group that began meeting at size apartments and discussions can lead to the</v>

112
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:53.430
<v Speaker 1>formation of two groups,</v>

113
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>one who advocated working peacefully towards independence from the French and</v>

114
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.540
<v Speaker 1>the other who were in favor of armed resistance.</v>

115
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.420
<v Speaker 1>From the very start saw was in the latter camp.</v>

116
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>He endures likeminded friends.</v>

117
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They pointed to other countries around the world were armed overthrow was</v>

118
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

119
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>and they noticed they all had one thing in common.</v>

120
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>The rebels were all communists.</v>

121
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 1>There was a vibrant communist movements in Paris at the time and sirens.</v>

122
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Those of his group he worked for armed rebellion,</v>

123
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 1>began attending meetings,</v>

124
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.350
<v Speaker 1>saw again studying the teachings of Karl Marx,</v>

125
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>but found them difficult to understand.</v>

126
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

127
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.520
<v Speaker 1>he readily cottoned onto the writings of Joseph Stalin and became a lifelong</v>

128
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 1>advocate of Stalinism with its emphasis on rapid industrialization,</v>

129
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.460
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian governments,</v>

130
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.050
<v Speaker 1>and the cult of personality.</v>

131
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>In 1951,</v>

132
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:44.550
<v Speaker 1>he joined the Communist Party and by the time that he returned to Cambodia in</v>

133
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 1>1953,</v>

134
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.340
<v Speaker 1>he had committed himself to the cause of the Cambodian revolution once back on</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cambodians soil sir journey north to join up with Cambodian forces who had</v>

136
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>attached themselves to the Vietnamese communists and that fight for independence</v>

137
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.834
<v Speaker 1>from the French.</v>

138
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.500
<v Speaker 1>He now lived in the jungle is a perspective guerilla fighter,</v>

139
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>but first he amped to do an apprenticeship.</v>

140
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>For the first few months,</v>

141
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>his duties consisted of maintaining the group's vegetable patch paydays recalled</v>

142
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>most everyone that was Vietnamese that were very few Cambodians for a long time,</v>

143
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing for me to do.</v>

144
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>After awhile they let me work in the kitchen,</v>

145
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>but really the Cambodians were there in name only.</v>

146
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Victory was achieved by Vietnamese communists in 1953 following the French</v>

147
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:37.200
<v Speaker 1>disaster at the battle of DNB and food.</v>

148
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.490
<v Speaker 1>The French pulled out of not just Vietnam,</v>

149
00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:40.720
<v Speaker 1>but Cambodia also.</v>

150
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.291
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

151
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>the new nationalists,</v>

152
00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Cambodian government who has had it not by a communist,</v>

153
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>probably the King Norodom Sihanouk still the top third of Cambodia,</v>

154
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>was under the control of Viet Minh,</v>

155
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 1>so Erin's other local communist soldier,</v>

156
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>the Viet Minh to continue pushing south until the entire country was communist.</v>

157
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.040
<v Speaker 1>But the leadership of the Viet Minh resisted.</v>

158
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:00.874
<v Speaker 1>This surgeon's.</v>

159
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.770
<v Speaker 1>A truce was arranged with the king,</v>

160
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.910
<v Speaker 1>so now resend to Phnom Penh where he continued to work for the political</v>

161
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:07.630
<v Speaker 1>undergrounds.</v>

162
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.220
<v Speaker 1>His Day job was as a school teacher where he taught history by noise,</v>

163
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

164
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.010
<v Speaker 1>he worked to establish contacts with every strata of society,</v>

165
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>from intellectuals to peasants in order to garner support for the coming</v>

166
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 1>communist revolution around this time,</v>

167
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>so at the man who would become his closest political associates and second in</v>

168
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:25.780
<v Speaker 1>command,</v>

169
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.700
<v Speaker 1>nuon chat,</v>

170
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.540
<v Speaker 1>chat later recalled that Sir had an innate ability to charm people and bring</v>

171
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:32.560
<v Speaker 1>them into the party.</v>

172
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Having the ability to explain things in a way that simple people were able to</v>

173
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:37.114
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

174
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>so also met up with a revolutionary students who he had worked with in Paris by</v>

175
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the name of King Van Zach.</v>

176
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.171
<v Speaker 1>Together.</v>

177
00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:48.040
<v Speaker 1>They worked on plans for the country's first free and open political elections,</v>

178
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>so I went to vans,</v>

179
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Zach's house for breakfast every morning to work on their party's manifesto.</v>

180
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

181
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.600
<v Speaker 1>that work did not come to fruition.</v>

182
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.800
<v Speaker 1>King Sihanouk because renounced his throat and formed his own political party,</v>

183
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.783
<v Speaker 1>the satin chrome.</v>

184
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>He threw his hat into the 1955 general election and one becoming Cambodia's.</v>

185
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:08.410
<v Speaker 1>New Prime Minister Nuke had achieved this victory,</v>

186
00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:11.770
<v Speaker 1>though by throwing his political rivals into prison for sub,</v>

187
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:16.000
<v Speaker 1>the Shaman action marks the end of any hopes he may have had for a democratic</v>

188
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:18.070
<v Speaker 1>means to bring about change in his country.</v>

189
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 1>He confirmed his commitment to violence overthrow wins through himself towards</v>

190
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 1>working toward that goal in July of 1956.</v>

191
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.580
<v Speaker 1>So I married a fellow Communist Party member by the name of q panare likes.</v>

192
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.340
<v Speaker 1>She had been educated in France and was equally committed to the revolution</v>

193
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:34.174
<v Speaker 1>recourse.</v>

194
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 1>They soon became the power couple of the underground communist movements.</v>

195
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Life was increasingly dangerous for the communists under the rule of CNN.</v>

196
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.700
<v Speaker 1>He had outlawed the Communist Party and it's given them a new name,</v>

197
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 1>the kind of of rouge,</v>

198
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>the pace of imprisonments killings and general Tara was stabbed top as the prime</v>

199
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>minister to stamp out any and all opposition to his rule.</v>

200
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>The Communist Party secretary,</v>

201
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>a close friend of so was taken to the outskirts of Phnom Penh and killed his</v>

202
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>during this climate of fear.</v>

203
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a accepted the leadership of the Climber Rouge.</v>

204
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It was constantly followed by the police who knew who he was,</v>

205
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but not his position in the party.</v>

206
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.711
<v Speaker 1>By 1960,</v>

207
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>three things had gotten too hot for Sarah in the capital city and d left to</v>

208
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>dwell in the jungle in the north.</v>

209
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

210
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 1>He was taken in by the Viet Minh who had set up camps on the Vietnam Cambodia</v>

211
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>

212
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.680
<v Speaker 1>They were now focused on a new enemy within their country.</v>

213
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>That's of course the United States from that Cambodian basis.</v>

214
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>They would regularly traveling to Vietnam to make lightening strikes before</v>

215
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>retreating back over the border in response to the American strawbs,</v>

216
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs in north Cambodia and and attempts to</v>

217
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>kill the Viet Minh and the process they killed.</v>

218
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Over the course of the war,</v>

219
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 1>nearly $150,000 Cambodians,</v>

220
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.653
<v Speaker 1>the American bombing,</v>

221
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.060
<v Speaker 1>have the effect of drawing more and more people to the [inaudible].</v>

222
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Soon said no longer had to rely only on the Viet Minh.</v>

223
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>He now had his own gorilla camps stretched out along the border and he himself,</v>

224
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>he had transformed himself in the mold of his hero,</v>

225
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Stalin.</v>

226
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.180
<v Speaker 1>He was the unquestioned party leader and he now went by the name Paul Pot.</v>

227
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>He lives apart from the rank and file of his army and only allowed a select few</v>

228
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.190
<v Speaker 1>the privilege of having an audience with him.</v>

229
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Paul believed that the lifeblood of his revolutionary forces would come from the</v>

230
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>peasantry,</v>

231
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but he also believed that they needed to be molded so their soul allegiance was</v>

232
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:26.244
<v Speaker 1>to the party.</v>

233
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.660
<v Speaker 1>New recruits would undergo an intense period of initiation where they would be</v>

234
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 1>locked in a cell until they were proven to be obedient.</v>

235
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Pole instituted as a rigid disciplinary structure which included group meetings</v>

236
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>where members have to confess their weaknesses and seek forgiveness.</v>

237
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>In 1970,</v>

238
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>prime minister can newquist overthrown by a military dictatorship.</v>

239
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 1>He escape to the north and sought to establish an alliance with this format</v>

240
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:56.181
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>

241
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.110
<v Speaker 1>the kind of bolstered by the supporters of CNU.</v>

242
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Speaker 1>The Canberra region numbers rose by 64,000.</v>

243
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:03.500
<v Speaker 1>By the spring of 1964,</v>

244
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.450
<v Speaker 1>many of them went.</v>

245
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:04.671
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

246
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:06.620
<v Speaker 1>armed with Chinese supplied rifles,</v>

247
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.610
<v Speaker 1>pole vault saw me of gradually filtered down from the border area and now</v>

248
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 1>controlled two thirds of Cambodia.</v>

249
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.510
<v Speaker 1>By December of 1974 pole felt in a strong enough position to make an assault on</v>

250
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:18.170
<v Speaker 1>the capital,</v>

251
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 1>became a revision cycle,</v>

252
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:20.091
<v Speaker 1>Phnom Penh,</v>

253
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:22.310
<v Speaker 1>and began to close in those you could flood.</v>

254
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The city is the streets became more zones.</v>

255
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Within five days,</v>

256
00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the military government was overpowered and the revolution was ifn.</v>

257
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 1>April the 17th,</v>

258
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:34.640
<v Speaker 1>1975 was day zero and the life of a new Cambodia,</v>

259
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia was now called Campo Chair and it was under the control of it's stolen</v>

260
00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and this leader Pol Pot.</v>

261
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.271
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

262
00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 1>just before we get into the really,</v>

263
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 1>really dark part of this video,</v>

264
00:11:43.881 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Paul Potts reign of terror.</v>

267
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but these sorts of videos I think they're important to make and they would be</v>

268
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:53.444
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>

269

308
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Check them out through the link below and now let's get back to the misery that</v>

309
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 1>is Pol Pot.</v>

310
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>The people who have been on Penn,</v>

311
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>they enthusiastically welcomes the climate rouge,</v>

312
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>but the smiles tend to alarm at the ruthlessness of Poles.</v>

313
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Men,</v>

314
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.710
<v Speaker 1>they shot any military forces on site.</v>

315
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Then Paul ordered a massive evacuation of the capital.</v>

316
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.320
<v Speaker 1>The reason given was that the Americans were about to bomb Phnom Penh.</v>

317
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Guy Maria soldiers went into the city forcing people out of hospitals in their</v>

318
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>

319
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Many died in the streets in the melee that followed.</v>

320
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.240
<v Speaker 1>The reality was that there was no threat of an American outrage.</v>

321
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Pol Pot simply wanted to get the people now so the way so that he could</v>

322
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on rebuilding his new society.</v>

323
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 1>He told his aides that they must use cutting edge violence in order to build a</v>

324
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 1>socialist system from the ground up.</v>

325
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>The 2 million people who were forced out of Phnom Penh has a pass through these</v>

326
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>checkpoints on the outskirts of the city that they were assigned to districts</v>

327
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>for reeducation as field laborers,</v>

328
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 1>the policy of equality with strictly enforced with any possessions that set city</v>

329
00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 1>folk apart from the peasantry being taken off them,</v>

330
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos,</v>

331
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>soldiers went through the now deserted capital and destroyed any of the</v>

332
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:26.200
<v Speaker 1>trappings of modern civilization that they could find.</v>

333
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Any people who were found to be hiding were taken into the street and shot under</v>

334
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Pol Pot regime.</v>

335
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Communist to quality meant that everyone wants to be a peasant.</v>

336
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>As a result of all of the modern advances of the last 100 years.</v>

337
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 1>They were rejected and even though former city dwellers and peasants were now</v>

338
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.960
<v Speaker 1>working in the field side by side,</v>

339
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that kind of rear driver see us held a special hatred for the form of urbanites</v>

340
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 1>who are considered to be capitalists.</v>

341
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 1>They were given only half of the food rations of the peasants.</v>

342
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>The equality policy included children to live with [inaudible] teachers from the</v>

343
00:14:58.491 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 1>age of seven onwards.</v>

344
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Private thoughts and feelings were considered to be evil with uniformity,</v>

345
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.340
<v Speaker 1>the only acceptable way of life the state who would choose which people got</v>

346
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:10.730
<v Speaker 1>married and anyone who was suspected of falling in love outside of this</v>

347
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 1>arrangements have beaten to death and public.</v>

348
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.480
<v Speaker 1>The regime outlawed any form of entertainment including sports with former</v>

349
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>sports fields and basketball courts being planted as rice fields.</v>

350
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of terror that had been generated reached into the Asher lawns of</v>

351
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>power with members of Paul's governments.</v>

352
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Iga.</v>

353
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 1>It's approved that they too were peasants and they worked in the fields.</v>

354
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.911
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

355
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 1>there was no real governance.</v>

356
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Poland's did use it,</v>

357
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 1>a rice harvesting quota on the people,</v>

358
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>which was three tons of unhosted rice per hectare,</v>

359
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.800
<v Speaker 1>but less than a third of this was actually being produced.</v>

360
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.431
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

361
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 1>the people were suffering physically.</v>

362
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Disease was rife,</v>

363
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>and millions suffered from malnutrition.</v>

364
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of people were dying every single day.</v>

365
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Paul blames the lack of success of his great vision on infiltrators and enemies</v>

366
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 1>of the party.</v>

367
00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 1>He devised a great purge to weed out those nonconformists estate secrets.</v>

368
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Interrogations and do is set it up so you in prison and torture.</v>

369
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Those were expected of being traitors.</v>

370
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 1>The families of those arrested would also be taken to the prison and tortured.</v>

371
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 1>If a child was too young to be interrogated,</v>

372
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>it would be taken away and simply killed immediately.</v>

373
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Any adults that you survived,</v>

374
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 1>that torture were taken out to the killing fields and beaten to death of the</v>

375
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>14,000 prisoners you pass through the gates of the main interrogation center in</v>

376
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.634
<v Speaker 1>Phnom Penh.</v>

377
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Only seven survived.</v>

378
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Many of those killed were loyal supporters who were falsely accused of treason.</v>

379
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Paul Potts had succeeded in imposing his ruthless iron fisted control within the</v>

380
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>borders of Cambodia,</v>

381
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.270
<v Speaker 1>but there was a new threat to his regime just over the border.</v>

382
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>The Vietnamese is having seen off the Americans now turn their attention on</v>

383
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia.</v>

384
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 1>A border dispute threatened to bring these two countries to war as the tensions</v>

385
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:50.871
<v Speaker 1>were rising.</v>

386
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Paulo did his latest purge right on the border zone.</v>

387
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.800
<v Speaker 1>He suspected his defensive forces in that area of colluding with the Vietnamese</v>

388
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 1>after being viciously interrogated more than 100,000 soldiers and party</v>

389
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:07.181
<v Speaker 1>officials along with their wives and that children were executed as a result of</v>

390
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:09.910
<v Speaker 1>this wholesale massacre of his own defense forces.</v>

391
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Paul left is eastern border with Vietnam open to invasion and that invasion came</v>

392
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 1>on Christmas Day.</v>

393
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 78,</v>

394
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.170
<v Speaker 1>taking just 13 days for the capital of Phnom Penh to fall.</v>

395
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Pol Pot managed to slip away and escape into the jungle,</v>

396
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>but at least his three and a half year reign of terror was over.</v>

397
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>In total it'd cost the lives of nearly 2 million people.</v>

398
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 1>The caiman ridge may have been over,</v>

399
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 1>but the party persisted for nearly 20 years at retina and continued to wage</v>

400
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:39.830
<v Speaker 1>guerrilla warfare from its jungle basis.</v>

401
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.371
<v Speaker 1>Ballpark,</v>

402
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>set up a base near the Thai border and rebuilt his military force with the aid</v>

403
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 1>of the Chinese and Thai governments.</v>

404
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.221
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

405
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:49.000
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnamese that installed a new government made up of kind of rear</v>

406
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>supporters who had escaped polls pageants</v>

407
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.570
<v Speaker 1>from his base in the northern part of the country.</v>

408
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Paul gave occasional interviews to reporters in which he would invariably accuse</v>

409
00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:05.980
<v Speaker 1>those who opposed him of being traitors.</v>

410
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.950
<v Speaker 1>In 1985,</v>

411
00:18:06.951 --> 00:18:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it was announced that he was retiring from the leadership of the kind of rouge.</v>

412
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

413
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.960
<v Speaker 1>the enemy's clamps down on the climate region moving into their strongholds and</v>

414
00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:16.220
<v Speaker 1>decimating that basis.</v>

415
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Paul managed to escape into Thailand's where he remained for the next few years.</v>

416
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.830
<v Speaker 1>In 1988,</v>

417
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 1>he went to China to undergo treatment for cancer.</v>

418
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.940
<v Speaker 1>The enemy's withdrew from Cambodia.</v>

419
00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:28.760
<v Speaker 1>In 1988 prompting polls or a from Thailand.</v>

420
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.590
<v Speaker 1>For the next eight years,</v>

421
00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:33.950
<v Speaker 1>the Caiman Rouge ran guerrilla operations against government forces.</v>

422
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.210
<v Speaker 1>In 1996,</v>

423
00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>the government began engaging in peace negotiations with individual kind of</v>

424
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.650
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>

425
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.590
<v Speaker 1>leading many of them to effect away from the organization.</v>

426
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

427
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Paul had suffered a stroke and was paralyzed on the left side of his body,</v>

428
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>but this didn't stop him from handing out death sentences.</v>

429
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.650
<v Speaker 1>When he heard that his longtime righthand man,</v>

430
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm was negotiating with the government,</v>

431
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.381
<v Speaker 1>the audit,</v>

432
00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:58.040
<v Speaker 1>his arrest and execution around this time that they've been members of Paul's</v>

433
00:18:58.041 --> 00:18:59.540
<v Speaker 1>family were also killed.</v>

434
00:18:59.541 --> 00:19:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Though it is unclear whether he ordered those killings.</v>

435
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.290
<v Speaker 1>On June the 19th,</v>

436
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:03.651
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

437
00:19:03.651 --> 00:19:07.760
<v Speaker 1>97 pole was arrested by the head of the military who had had enough of his</v>

438
00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:08.720
<v Speaker 1>murderous ways.</v>

439
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.550
<v Speaker 1>A show trial was conducted for the ordering of the execution of transcendence.</v>

440
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Pole was confined to house arrest for the rest of his life</v>

441
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:22.991
<v Speaker 1>and it's finally,</v>

442
00:19:22.991 --> 00:19:27.130
<v Speaker 1>as Paul had become an avid listener to the voice of America radio show on the</v>

443
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.150
<v Speaker 1>night of April the 17th,</v>

444
00:19:28.151 --> 00:19:28.961
<v Speaker 1>1998.</v>

445
00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:32.320
<v Speaker 1>He was surprised to hear that the [inaudible] should agree to handover to an</v>

446
00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:34.780
<v Speaker 1>international tribunal for crimes against humanity.</v>

447
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Later that night,</v>

448
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:36.843
<v Speaker 1>he died in bed.</v>

449
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Paul Paul's body was requested by the Cambodian government for inspection,</v>

450
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.170
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

451
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.020
<v Speaker 1>he was cremated and his followers before the government could get their hands on</v>

452
00:19:44.021 --> 00:19:44.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

453
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:44.861
<v Speaker 1>This is that.</v>

454
00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Be Able to speculate that he actually committed suicide rather than being handed</v>

455
00:19:48.431 --> 00:19:49.264
<v Speaker 1>over to the court.</v>

456
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.253
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

457
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.160
<v Speaker 1>neither he nor anyone else has ever faced justice for the horror of Cambodian</v>

458
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.110
<v Speaker 1>killing fields.</v>
