1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.080
When it comes to serial child killer Albert Fish.

2
00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:07.660
The adjectives to describe as in humanity hardly seem strong enough to proved

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.880
perverted,
deviant degenerates.
He was all of that,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.140
but he was much more the crimes he committed.
Fill the heart with rage.
Well,

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.070
the taunting letters he sent the victim's families make you wonder how a human

6
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.090
being could possibly be so cruel.
And this week's biographics,

7
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:27.590
we venture into the sordid life of Albert Fish and fair warning.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.960
This episode,
it ain't pretty

9
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.410
how Molten Howard Alba's fish was born on May the 19th,

10
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.460
1870 in Washington DC.

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.510
His father Rendell was 75 years old when he was born,

12
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:54.630
being 43 years older than his mother Ellen.
The old man died when,
uh,

13
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:56.450
but it was five years old and the children,

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.260
they were placed into an orphanage and the orphanage Albert's sang in the choir.

15
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.270
He was also subjected to merciless beatings by other boys as well as even staff

16
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:08.120
members.
The physical pain of the beatings in the wings.

17
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.660
He Games a realize gave him a sort of sexual pleasure.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.180
He would get erections midway through a beating,

19
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.840
which would bring ridicule and further torment from the older boys.

20
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.830
Albert spent four years at the orphanage when he was nine his mother secured a

21
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.080
job and took her children back.
Two years later,

22
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.340
I began a relationship with the telegraph boy who introduced him to a range of

23
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:32.180
depraved practices including drinking urine and eating feces.

24
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.210
He also took to hanging out at local bathing rooms so that he could have watched

25
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:36.860
young boys getting undressed.

26
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.850
At around the age of 11 Albert's fell from a cherry tree and suffered a serious

27
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.420
concussion.
This would result in constant headaches,
dizzy spells,

28
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.980
and to pronounced stutter.

29
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.720
In 1890 he moved to New York City with his mother.

30
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
He would later tell the police that he became a male prostitute at this time,

31
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.690
but this has never been substantiated.

32
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.100
He began working as a painter and to paper hanger.
Is there anything ese 90 is,

33
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.720
according to his later testimony,

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.100
he regularly molested young children preferring those who are under the age of

35
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.760
six.

36
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.110
He also enjoyed writing obscene letters to women who had placed personal ads in

37
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:16.944
the newspapers.

38
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.360
In 1898 Albert's mother arranged for him to marry a 19 year old girl by the name

39
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:25.560
of Anna Mary Hoffman.
They would go on to have six children at the same time.

40
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.310
He maintained sexual relationships with a string of male lovers.

41
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.540
One of them took into a wax works museum during which time now,

42
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:36.180
but it became fascinated by a model of a dissected human penis.

43
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.290
It was this experience that developed in him a fascination with genital

44
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.350
mutilation and castration for the rest of his life.

45
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
He would insert needles into his scrotum and penis and audit to achieve sexual

46
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.504
satisfaction.

47
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.120
In 1983 fish was arrested for embezzlement and sentence.
Do you sing sing prison?

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.010
During his incarceration,
he regularly had sex with other men off to his release.

49
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:06.610
As children recalled that his behavior became increasingly bizarre.

50
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.960
He would regularly hear voices and declaims that he was receiving messages from

51
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.890
the Apostle John.
On one occasion,
his oldest son,
Albert's Jr.

52
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:18.160
I saw him standing on a hillside with his arms out stretched and he was

53
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.960
screaming,
I am Christ.

54
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.170
He was convinced that he was being directed by God to castrate little boys,

55
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.651
psychiatrists,

56
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:30.820
which later diagnosed him with a condition known as religious mania.

57
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.330
The children would also recall seeing their father flagellating himself on the

58
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.550
back with a nail.
Studied paddle.

59
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.110
In 1910 fish began a sexual relationship with a 19 year old intellectually

60
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.330
disabled man by the name of Thomas Ketan.

61
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.600
Fish was working away from home in Wilmington,
Delaware.

62
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
He brought Kevin back to his room and the two engaged in sadomasochistic sexual

63
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:51.670
acts.

64
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.350
Over a period of days these acts became more and more like torture with fish

65
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.880
inflicting all of the pain.

66
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.200
He took a cat into an old farm house with the intention of killing the buy and

67
00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:04.450
dissecting his body in the auntie Millie cut off half of Catherine's penis

68
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.110
before leaving him to his own fate.
In 1917 fishes,

69
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.090
wife left him for another man I wish was left with six children to raise on his

70
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:15.700
own according to fish and it took virtually all of the possessions that the

71
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.770
family owns and it was from this point.

72
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.850
But his paranoia to come new dimensions is children.
Once found him,

73
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.760
wraps up in a carpet since he would encourage them to hit him on the bed.

74
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.480
Buttocks with his nail,
studied paddle.
However,

75
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.660
none of the children ever claims that their father physically abused them.

76
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.380
It was around this time that Alba began experimenting with cannibalism.

77
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.830
He started by eating raw meats,
which he would also serve to the children,

78
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:42.520
and then this escalated to human flesh.

79
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.700
In 1919 fish intensifying as criminal activities abducting,
abusing,

80
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.090
and murdering young boys in and around the Washington DC area.

81
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.570
It's typical victim would be black or intellectually impaired.

82
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.600
Does he believe that the police would be less inclined to pursue the

83
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:05.160
disappearance of these children?

84
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.600
He develops the skill of luring children away by offering them gift since

85
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:14.490
appearing to be exceedingly kinds and flattering towards them.
In July,

86
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.240
1924 fish came across a young girl who was playing alone on her parents,

87
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:19.290
Staten Island farm.

88
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.440
He had convinced the goal to go off with them to pick rhubarb.

89
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:24.390
When the mother arrived and scat him off.

90
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.080
It's still his obsession with the eight year old girl forced him to return and

91
00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:30.180
he tried to sleep in the barn.
Once again,

92
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.170
he was discovered this time by the father and he was once again and chased away.

93
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.740
Another botched abduction occurred when he invited two young boys to his

94
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.750
apartment for lunch.
While he was preparing the food,

95
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:41.160
the boys waited in his bedroom.

96
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.000
They began play wrestling on the bears and then they fell onto the floor there

97
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:49.110
they saw under the bed fishers self-described instruments of hell,

98
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.320
a meat cleaver,
a hacksaw,
and to knife frightened out of their wits.

99
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.620
The two boys took to their heels running past fish and right out of apartments,

100
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.041
fishes,

101
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.880
modus operandi of snatching the unimportant and the unmissed was thrown into

102
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.900
chaos when he unwittingly abducted and murdered Francis Mcdonald,

103
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.120
the son of a stash and island police officer.

104
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.780
The eight year old was playing ball on the street with four friends when fish

105
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.250
who had been hanging around for hours called the by over when his friends down

106
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.190
to see where Francis,
well,

107
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.060
it's both here in the stranger had gone when France has failed to return home.

108
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.710
His father sent out after him.

109
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.650
After scouring the neighborhoods and questioning the other boys,

110
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.890
he kept hearing about the gray haired man who had been hanging around.

111
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.800
Then he telegraphed to police headquarters the next day.

112
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.890
A massive search was underway throughout Staten Island's.

113
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.910
Eventually though the body of Francis Mcdonald was founded by three boy scouts

114
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:41.090
under a pile of branches and leaves on a railroad property.

115
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.750
All of the clothing below the child's waste had been pulled from his body.

116
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.560
It was apparent that he had been viciously sexually assaulted,
fissured,

117
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.000
finished him off by strangling Francis with his own suspended us which way wound

118
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.630
so tightly that they appeared to be a part of his flesh.
Within minutes,

119
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:59.570
more than 50 police officers were surrounding the body.
The next day,

120
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.830
the case was given the highest priority with 250 officers assigned to us.

121
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.560
The boy's father,
Arthur McDonald,

122
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.380
was transferred from Manhattan bracing to Staten Island so that you could

123
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:11.450
personally work on his son's case.

124
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.290
The autopsy on Francis Body revealed that he had been eating raisins just prior

125
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.010
to his death.

126
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.400
The police concluded that this must've been the lure that the killer used to

127
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:20.390
pull the boy away.

128
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.050
The terrible condition of the body caused the coroner to conclude that the

129
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:26.150
attacker could not have been an elderly man.

130
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.660
It's a cause that degree of physical damage.
He must've been in his prime.

131
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.450
Hysteria,

132
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.700
swept through the state and daily reports came in of sightings of the gray man

133
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.160
in the weeks following the discovery of the child's body.

134
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:40.400
Dozens of men were questions with several being arrested,

135
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:43.730
but they to released hopes for an early resolution to the case and vanished as

136
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.830
the leads just dried up with public interest in the case fading the dead boy.

137
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:50.000
His mother made a desperate plea to the public.

138
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.980
Help us catch the monster who killed our by.
Help us find the gray man.

139
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.760
On May the 25th 1928 18 year old Edward Bud placed a one line classified

140
00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:10.410
advertisements in the New York Wells newspaper in an attempt to find employment.

141
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.340
Three days later,

142
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.270
an elderly man knocked on the front door of the boat apartments on 15th Street

143
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.223
in Manhattan.

144
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.190
He said his name was Frank Howard and he was replying to the situations wanted

145
00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:21.024
ad in the paper.

146
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.740
Edward Bud's mother invited him in and sent his younger sister Beatrice to fetch

147
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.410
brother from next door.
Edward seem tons up with his friend Willy and toe.

148
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.180
Howard offered both boys jobs on his farm in Farmingdale Long Island.

149
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.390
He then told them that he would return on Saturday and drive the boys to the

150
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:40.260
farm the following Saturday.
The boys weighted excitedly with their bags packed,

151
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.820
but Mr. Howard,
he never turns up.
Instead say telegraph was delivered,

152
00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:47.730
which told the boys that how would it had been delayed and we'd come for the

153
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:50.970
boys the next day.
He turns off in the early afternoon on Sunday,

154
00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:52.890
just there's the family had returned from church.

155
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.780
He was invited to stay for lunch.

156
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960
It was sitting at the food table that Mr. Howard got his first view of grace,

157
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.990
but the pretty ea roles was dressed in her best Sunday clothes.

158
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.950
The old man was immediately smitten,
beckoning grace over to him.
Shoot,

159
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.020
moved to a mother who nodded her assent.

160
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.390
Mr. Howard told grace how pretty she was.

161
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.330
He then asked if she was a good counter.
When she nodded,

162
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:17.970
he pulls from his pocket.
It's the biggest one of money.

163
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.710
There's anyone in the room had ever seen.

164
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.220
He laid the cash and the coins on the table and asked grace to counter from

165
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:23.970
grace,

166
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.970
counted out $92 and 50 cents of the conclusion of which Mr. Howard rewarded her

167
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:33.810
with a 50 cent piece and told her to go and buy some candy.
The rns system again,

168
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.620
the mother nodded her approval and the list will go left the room happy.

169
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.180
It was then the old man informed the buds that there had been a slight change of

170
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.510
plan.
He had to attend his young nieces birthday party that afternoon.

171
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.020
He would return for the boys that evening.
Then just as he was leaving,

172
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.470
he turned to Mr [inaudible] said that he just had a thought would they allow him

173
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.890
to take young grace to the birthday party?
He said it was going to be good fun.

174
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:59.910
There was going to be lots of food and games and plenty of children her age and

175
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:04.050
of course he would have her back by nine o'clock this is bud was hesitant.

176
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:05.430
They didn't even know this man,

177
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.910
but he didn't seem exceedingly kinds and he clearly loved children.

178
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.930
Before she could answer,

179
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:13.620
husbands had made up her mind for her saying that the girl never got out and it

180
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:17.070
would be good for her to have some fun for a change.
This is bud ones,

181
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.810
isn't know where the party was going to be.

182
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.860
How it answered that it was a to assist display,

183
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.980
so the hundred 37th and Columbus Avenue,

184
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.760
the buds didn't realize that Columbus street ends it a hundred and 10th street.

185
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.940
Say the address did not exist and so it was the young grace bud was dressed up

186
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:36.390
in a spring carrot and gray hat with blue streamers and headed off up the street

187
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.553
with the gray man.

188
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.340
Misses Bud stood at the door and watched them disappear around the corner.

189
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.100
It was the last time that she ever saw her daughter.

190
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.480
The buds weighted with growing alarm for Mr. Howard to return with grace.

191
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.420
By Monday morning,
Mrs Bud was hysterical with worry.

192
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.080
Edward was rushed off to the nearest police station to report that the goal was

193
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.650
missing.

194
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.790
A short time later for detectives arrived at the bud home to question the family

195
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.580
about kidnapping.
It was big news,
the life of the country.

196
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.110
The case was unique in that the whole bud family had gotten a long and detailed

197
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:09.270
look at the so called Mr. Howard.

198
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.140
Thousands of flyers were printed with a detailed description accompanied by a

199
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:17.310
photo of grace.
These weren't distributed throughout the u s as well as Canada.

200
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.330
As expected,
there were a rash of false sightings and leads that went nowhere,

201
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.560
but then a solid lead finally emerged the telegraph office.
Well,

202
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:29.010
how would it send the Telegraph to the buds from was identified and intensive

203
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:31.080
search of that area then found another clue,

204
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.010
a food basket that how would it left at the bud's house was identified and the

205
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:37.800
man who had sold it to Howard,
it was tracked down from this.

206
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:41.250
It was deduced that the kidnapper was a resident of East Harlem,

207
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.820
but from there the trail that went cold despite a raft of letters and

208
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:49.020
confessions coming in,
nothing panned out.
Then in September,

209
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.220
1930 there was a break in the case.

210
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.010
Police arrested a 66 year old by the name of Charles Pope.

211
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.310
Pope was held in custody for three and a half months and then put on trial and

212
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:00.250
you need to be found not guilty.
In November,

213
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.180
1934 the still grieving parents of grace budge received an excruciating league.

214
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:08.860
Gruesome letter,
which police later confirmed was from Albert Fish.
Read in pass.

215
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.210
I grabbed her and she said she would tell her Mama first.
I stripped her naked.

216
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.480
How she did kick,
bite and scratch.
I choked her to death.

217
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.520
Then Casa in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms,
cook and details,

218
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.120
how sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven.

219
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.320
It took me nine days to eat her entire body.

220
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.230
The police were able to compare the handwriting in the latter to the telegraph

221
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:40.210
notes that they had recovered years before.

222
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.030
It was immediately obvious that they were written by the same person,

223
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.090
but it wasn't the letter itself that finally brought Albert fish down.

224
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.790
It was the envelope in which it was contained,

225
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.410
printed on the back of the envelope flap where the initials and why Pcba police

226
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:54.490
were able to track it down.

227
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:57.670
So the New York private chauffeurs Benevolence Association,

228
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.880
they found out that the janitor at the association had taken a bunch of

229
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:05.170
envelopes home to his rooming house at 620 to Lexington Avenue.

230
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.300
Just activists descended on the boarding house.

231
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:11.020
But we're frustrated that no one there recognize the description of Mr. Howard.

232
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.140
But then the janitor remembered that when he had taken the envelopes,

233
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.600
he had not yet moved to Lexington Avenue.

234
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.450
He still had been living at east 52nd street.

235
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.630
When a detective showed the landlady your description of Mr. Howard,

236
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.260
she immediately recognized him as the elderly man who had moved in.

237
00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:27.520
When the janitor had left,

238
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.000
the officer asked to see the man's signature and the register pulling out the

239
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:32.440
letter that had been sent to Mrs,

240
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:37.120
but he could see that the signature was written by the same person who wrote the

241
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:38.020
disgusting latter.

242
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.150
The man had signed his name as Albert h fish.

243
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.900
The detective discovered from the landlady that Albert fish who would move it

244
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:50.380
out a few days earlier,
received regular support checks from his son.

245
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.670
On several occasions he had asked the landlady to cash the checks on his behalf.

246
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.370
It just so happens that the check was due any day.

247
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.620
Insufficient said that he would return for us.

248
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.700
The police now set up a 24 hour surveillance of the boarding house.
Yup.

249
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.480
After three weeks there was still no sign of fish and the surveillance was

250
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:08.710
reluctantly called off.

251
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.070
Then on December the fourth the land's Lady of the rooming house phones,

252
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:16.060
the police do inform them that fish had just come in and inquired about his

253
00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:20.350
check.
In fact,
as he was still that the landlady was told to stall him,

254
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.590
she ushered him into a room and gave him a cup of tea.
Minutes later,

255
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:27.160
a detective walked into the room and looking at the frail old man on the couch

256
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:30.910
said,
Albert Fish.
Fish was momentarily taken aback,

257
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.140
but then he reached into his vest pockets and boil down to razorblades and held

258
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.760
it out.
Threateningly that is active.

259
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:40.060
Quickly closed in and grabs the old man's risks and twisted.

260
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.290
The blade fell to the floor.

261
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.110
Then the pathetic killer slumped back down on the couch.

262
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.770
Looking down at the man had been hunting for years.
The detective simply said,

263
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.143
I've got you now.

264
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.890
Alba fish went on trial for the murder of grace bars on march the 11th 1935 the

265
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:04.130
night before the had managed to extract a chicken bone from the CPA had been

266
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:08.330
served.
Sharpen it to a point and proceed to repeatedly stab himself with it.

267
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.710
When a god heard him moaning,

268
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:12.740
he rushed in and managed to take the makeshift weapon away from him.

269
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.960
It was reported as a suicide attempt,

270
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:19.520
but it was simply a means of satisfying is deranged sexual desires.

271
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.000
They're out of the 10 day trial,
fish maintained and in different attitude.

272
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.600
He sounded slumped in his chair often with his eyes closed and appeared to show

273
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.000
absolutely no interest in what was going on.

274
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.160
One report that describes him as resembling a corpse insecurely props in a chat

275
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.400
that events readily admitted that fish committed the crime.

276
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.990
It was that contention.
However,

277
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:42.560
the tea was legally insane at the time of the killing and that he remains that

278
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.940
way as he sat in front of them.

279
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.330
The prosecution on the other hand set out to prove the opposite thought he was

280
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:51.290
saying that he knew the wrongness of what he was doing and therefore he must

281
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:52.940
answer for his actions.

282
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.450
The prosecution called a series of psychiatrists as witnesses.

283
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.800
Each of him stated that the defendant was seen though suffering from a whole

284
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:03.130
host of psychotic conditions.
In the end,

285
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.920
the prosecution did persuade the jury that fish was saying they found him guilty

286
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:08.480
of murder in the first degree.

287
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.830
The sentence was execution and the electric chap at sing sing prison.

288
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.160
One of the jurors later revealed that most of the jurors actually felt that fish

289
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:16.911
was insane,

290
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:20.990
but they felt more strongly that he was deserving of the electric chair.

291
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.320
Albert Fish's last day on earth was January the 16th 1936 he was escorted into

292
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:37.370
the Execution Chamber is 11:06 PM he cost his hands together in prayer as he was

293
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:41.620
lowered into the chair and strapped in the leather cap was fitters and

294
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.440
electrodes were attached to a skin as the current surge through his body,

295
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:48.770
Albert Fish's body jolted backwards and veins in his neck,

296
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.660
bulged and his fists in voluntarily clenched.
Then his body went limp.

297
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.170
The Monster.
He was no more so.

298
00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:59.840
I'm absolutely not going to ask if you enjoyed that video,

299
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:04.490
