<v Speaker 1>only equals in modern times by the disaster.</v>

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>That was Oj Simpson.</v>

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

10
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>In this week's biographics,</v>

11
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>we are diving into the Algebra righteous life of the self proclaimed genius</v>

12
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Oscar Wilde.</v>

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll skip and go flat out.</v>

14
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:43.281
<v Speaker 1>He Wills Wilde into the weld on October the 16th 1854 the flamboyance of his</v>

15
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:43.961
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

16
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>but was a portions of things to come.</v>

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.921
<v Speaker 1>His parents,</v>

18
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>they were socially prominent Anglo Irish Protestants,</v>

19
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>each where the collective interest say belief in national politics and take</v>

20
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>publishing career of their own.</v>

21
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Oscar's father William was a renounced physician specializing in the eye and yet</v>

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>he was a slight on campus to figure with an ugly beard and a roving eye,</v>

23
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>but this absolutely did not stop him carrying on numerous affairs throughout his</v>

24
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>marriage and he fathered several illegitimate children.</v>

25
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>In contrast to our husband know Oscar's mother Jane was especially elegant and</v>

26
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.304
<v Speaker 1>statuesque.</v>

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>She was almost six feet tall and towered over our husbands.</v>

28
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>She was a woman who longed to make a sensation,</v>

29
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>one stating that I should like to rage through life.</v>

30
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>This Orthodox creeping is too tame for me as well.</v>

31
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>You probably guessed that this was the attitude that that her son would quickly</v>

32
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>embrace when Oscar and her second son was eight months old.</v>

33
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Jean described him as a great stout creature who minds nothing but growing fat.</v>

34
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Jane had actually wants to go in a set to have dressed Oscar and treated him as</v>

35
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>a daughter for the first decade of his life.</v>

36
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That's age nine Oscar,</v>

37
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>along with his older brother,</v>

38
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:52.111
<v Speaker 1>Willie,</v>

39
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>was sent to his first score,</v>

40
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the Portora royal boarding school in Enniskillen foreign,</v>

41
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>the Protestant north of Ireland's Oscar was younger than most of his peers,</v>

42
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:00.970
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

43
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>At first he was a clips by his older brother,</v>

44
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>but by the time that Willie was set to leave Portora,</v>

45
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>he had been superseded academically by Oscar.</v>

46
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

47
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>the younger Wilde was intellectually far ahead of his classmates in 1889 he</v>

<v Speaker 1>would for a wager read a three volume novel in half an hour,</v>

66
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>he went to London and was dazzled by his first taste of the metropolis.</v>

67
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.171
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he traveled to a nother metropolis and that was Paris.</v>

69
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It was there with his mother and brother that he received news that he had won</v>

70
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>his scholarship and had not only one it,</v>

71
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but it achieved the highest mark of the entire group,</v>

72
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.691
<v Speaker 1>Oscar,</v>

00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>that he absolutely made the most of his time at Oxford.</v>

74
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It was during this time that he cultivated his aesthetic sensibilities,</v>

75
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>filling his room with lilies and spending vast portions of his father's money</v>

76
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>upgrading the deck or of his room.</v>

77
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>It was at this time that he famously said,</v>

78
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue China.</v>

79
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Whilst he was never a fan of sports,</v>

80
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>but he did enjoy watching others play crickets and also run.</v>

81
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>He developed a reputation for his wit proclaiming that the only possible</v>

83
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>he was absolutely no pushover.</v>

84
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It is believed that once while in his room for undergraduates pounced on him to</v>

85
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>beat him up and smashes belongings while they said to have kicked out the first</v>

<v Speaker 1>held the third through the end and it's carried the last back to his own room</v>

89
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and then tossed him on the floor.</v>

90
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Now it was during his time at Oxford that wilds became a mason.</v>

99
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>That is something attorneys can't take away.</v>

100
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Oscar the emerged from Oxford with a degree and a clear vision of what was in</v>

101
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:53.560

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>and to not to know Mr Wales is not to be known.</v>

142
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Despite this ever growing reputation,</v>

143
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>wild found himself in tough financial straits.</v>

144
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>He was offered and accepted a series of lecture tours around America to coincide</v>

145
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 1>with the New York opening of patients.</v>

146
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.360
<v Speaker 1>He set sail on Christmas Eve 1881 to instruct the new world in the English arts</v>

147
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>of Renaissance.</v>

148
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>On arrival he told the New York customs officer,</v>

149
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to to clad.</v>

150
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>That's my genius,</v>

151
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>but don't try this today.</v>

152
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Anyone.</v>

153
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.281
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

154
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the Americans,</v>

155
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>the were absolutely fascinated by him and the original schedule was to be</v>

156
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>extended repeatedly in order to meet public demands.</v>

157
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It would last almost a year and it would even extend to Canada financially.</v>

158
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:08.091
<v Speaker 1>He did very,</v>

159
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>very well out of this tall.</v>

160
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>He actually stayed in New York for two months after the tours ends.</v>

161
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>He then briefly returned to London in January of 1883 before relocating to Paris</v>

162
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:20.180
<v Speaker 1>where he immersed himself in artistic circles.</v>

163
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that he made himself over physically.</v>

164
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>He had his long flowing locks transformed into a bowl haircut and to took to</v>

165
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>wearing a black overcoat.</v>

166
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 1>This was increased contrast to the flamboyance colors that he was previously</v>

167
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:36.340
<v Speaker 1>known for in May of 1883 wild or returned to London,</v>

168
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 1>apparently motivated by his interest in a woman named Constance Lloyd,</v>

169
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of a prosperous Lund and lawyer for the last few years.</v>

170
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Despite here's American earnings is Oscar have set and money worries,</v>

171
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.180
<v Speaker 1>variety.</v>

172
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Marriage would also solve those problems while also answering the growing gossip</v>

173
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>about his sexual character.</v>

174
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>A year long courtship followed with the marriage taking place on the 29th of</v>

175
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

176
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>1884 the couple they honeymooned in Paris and then thanks to his new father in</v>

177
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.930
<v Speaker 1>law's money occupied a four story house in London.</v>

178
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 1>He then went ahead and had the place redecorated at huge expense,</v>

179
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>which plunged the newlyweds into immediate debt.</v>

180
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Wild's first child Cyril was born on the 5th of June,</v>

181
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>1885 with Vivian following on November the fifth 1886 with his writing career</v>

182
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:22.711
<v Speaker 1>going nowhere,</v>

183
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>but he agreed to a British lecture tour with topics such as the value of art in</v>

184
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>modern life,</v>

185
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>lecturing and other invitations.</v>

186
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>They kept him away from his family home a lot and during these long absences he</v>

187
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>began to surround himself with young men writing undauntedly of his infatuation</v>

188
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>with the beauty of the male form.</v>

189
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 1>He formed an especially close friendship with a 17 year olds named Robbie Ross</v>

190
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 2>during the late 1880</v>

191
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.731
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

192
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>bringing in money with occasional book reviews at Wildworks on his first novel,</v>

193
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>the picture of Dorian Gray when the book was published in a magazine in 1890 it</v>

194
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>caused an immediate scandal,</v>

195
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>the storyline and involved a subtly eroticize triangle of relationships between</v>

196
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>three men and it was condemned by many as being immoral.</v>

197
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Whilst it predicted such an outcome to having written the following.</v>

198
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:17.844
<v Speaker 1>In the preface,</v>

199
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.580
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book.</v>

200
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Books are well written or badly written.</v>

201
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That is all it was around this time.</v>

202
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>The wild was introduced to do a blondes basket and undergraduates by the name of</v>

203
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Lord Alfred Douglas,</v>

204
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but he was known to his intimate,</v>

205
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.333
<v Speaker 1>says Boise.</v>

206
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Oscar quickly became obsessed with a 22 year olds.</v>

207
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>From this time on,</v>

208
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Oscar saw constants and his children less often.</v>

209
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>He did writings from rented addresses or hotels usually with Boise and Tome</v>

210
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Boise's father was actually the marquis of Queensbury.</v>

211
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

212
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>The man who developed the rules of professional boxing.</v>

213
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.430
<v Speaker 1>He took an immediate and intense exception to the relationship between his son</v>

214
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.701
<v Speaker 1>and his,</v>

215
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:54.660
<v Speaker 1>the famous whiles.</v>

216
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I bought it from the actual aspect of their relationship.</v>

217
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Queensberry was enraged that wilder was distracting his son from his studies at</v>

218
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Oxford.</v>

219
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>When Boise quit his studies in May of 1893 the marquee became determined to</v>

220
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>bring wild down,</v>

221
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was around this time that wild finally achieved success on the stage or</v>

222
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>woman of no importance,</v>

223
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>so pins on April the 19th 1893 to widespread a claim during its run.</v>

224
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It brought him between 170 and 200 pounds per week is next play through satire.</v>

225
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 1>An ideal husband was also successful providing the means for Oscar and Boise to</v>

226
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>travel widely and live extravagantly.</v>

227
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>The Marquis of Queensbury thought his son's failure to dig his degree in Oxford.</v>

228
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>What was a scandalous waste of time?</v>

229
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 1>He placed the blame squarely at the feet of wild,</v>

230
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>referring it to the relationship as the most Lutherism and disgusting.</v>

231
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Queensberry began absolutely hounding the path.</v>

232
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He actually even threatened to disinherit by seat.</v>

233
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>So this the son replied with a telegram.</v>

234
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.801
<v Speaker 1>What are they?</v>

235
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Funny Little Man.</v>

236
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 1>You are Queensberry not surprising.</v>

237
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>They didn't like this one bit.</v>

238
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Ends on the 19th of June.</v>

239
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Queensbury burst in on wild at is tied the street address in London.</v>

240
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>He had a bodyguard with him.</v>

241
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Then it's proceeded to threaten bodily harm unless the relationship ended</v>

242
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:07.800
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

243
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>So what was Boise's reactions all of this?</v>

244
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:10.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 1>he wrote nonchalantly to his father.</v>

246
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 1>I write to inform you that I treat your absurd threats with absolute</v>

247
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>indifference.</v>

248
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>The encounter though,</v>

249
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it's unsettled.</v>

250
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Wild who got out of London for several months going on a holiday with his family</v>

251
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 1>to where then this is where he works on his latest play,</v>

252
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the importance of being earnest,</v>

253
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't before Boise,</v>

254
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 1>unable to stay away,</v>

255
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 1>invited himself along.</v>

256
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.600
<v Speaker 1>And as you might imagine,</v>

257
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>this caused a little bit of tension between Mr and Mrs Wiles,</v>

258
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 1>the importance of being earnest opens to great applause.</v>

259
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.940
<v Speaker 1>On February the 14th 1895 do weeks later.</v>

260
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It was already a wild success and in through Oscar Wilde's style,</v>

261
00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:52.520
<v Speaker 1>he began basking in the glow of this.</v>

262
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>It was at this that wild calls in at the lavish Albermarle club.</v>

263
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 1>There he was handed a card from Queensbury by a port APP.</v>

264
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>On this card was scrawled do Oscar Wilde posing sodomite.</v>

265
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>That's Boise's urging wild when's a Margaret Street police station to ask for a</v>

266
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>warrant for Queens.</v>

267
00:12:07.851 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Barry's arrest on the grounds of Lidl.</v>

268
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.530
<v Speaker 1>The case came to trial on April the third prosecuting counsel Leadwood Carson</v>

269
00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>and put on the stand a 16 year old boy who claimed had been paid for sex by</v>

270
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:18.260
<v Speaker 1>wiles.</v>

271
00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Carson then went on to dissect works published by wild revealing.</v>

272
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed homosexual undertones,</v>

273
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>so malady wilds reacts to this rather serious events.</v>

274
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:27.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 1>he chose to wield his celebrated wit as his main defensive tool.</v>

276
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>He was often funny,</v>

277
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>but the implicit superiority in his position,</v>

278
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it was also damaging in one exchange when Carson asked whether the affection and</v>

279
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 1>love that is portrayed in the picture of Dorian gray might lead an ordinary</v>

280
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>individual to believe it had a sort of medical tendency.</v>

281
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Oscar replied,</v>

282
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I have no knowledge of the ordinary individual,</v>

283
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 1>which didn't exactly inderam to anyone.</v>

284
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Wilds council and Edward Clarke,</v>

285
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:53.441
<v Speaker 1>we'll say,</v>

286
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 1>made serious miscalculations that did his clients no favors.</v>

287
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>He went over the letters of the Queensberry had sent his son in an attempt to</v>

288
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>show how crazy the father had become to the jury.</v>

289
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Though queens breeze volatility was driven by a paternal regard for Boise's</v>

290
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 1>character as Carson budget.</v>

291
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 1>His clients had one hope alone and that was simply saving his son on the third</v>

292
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:16.700
<v Speaker 1>day of proceedings with things not exactly going brilliantly wild.</v>

293
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>He chose not to attend.</v>

294
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 1>This was to prove the most damaging day.</v>

295
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Yet with Carson announcing that he intended to introduce saying number of boys</v>

296
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>who would testify to shocking acts performed by Oscar.</v>

297
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Now without consulting his clients.</v>

298
00:13:29.031 --> 00:13:29.571
<v Speaker 1>While it's lie,</v>

299
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:31.420
<v Speaker 1>a Clark offered to abandon the case.</v>

300
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:31.841
<v Speaker 1>The defense,</v>

301
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

302
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>insisted that the original the stamps,</v>

303
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>the judge agreed and compelled and acquittal from the jury Queensberry he was</v>

304
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 1>found not guilty of libel.</v>

305
00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Against wiles is it now been proven that is written.</v>

306
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Accusation of sodomy was not libelous,</v>

307
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 1>but now there was another important consequence.</v>

308
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It left wild,</v>

309
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 1>highly vulnerable to arrest for sodomy,</v>

310
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>which was a crime at that time in England and well,</v>

311
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:56.740
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what happens at five in the evening of the day,</v>

312
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the libel case was decided.</v>

313
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.880
<v Speaker 1>A summons was issued for the arrest of Oscar Wilde's.</v>

314
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.860
<v Speaker 1>The charge was committing acts of gross indecency hiding in the Catagen hotel.</v>

315
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Oscar was urged by Boise and others to take a boat immediately for France.</v>

316
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Even his wife told him to run.</v>

317
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:12.161
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

318
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>this just didn't sit right with whales.</v>

319
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 1>He was determined to stand his ground and declaring,</v>

320
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I shall stay and do my sentence,</v>

321
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

322
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.580
<v Speaker 1>At 6:10 PM do detectives arrived and to our case,</v>

323
00:14:22.581 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>semi drunk wilds to both street station.</v>

324
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>The arrest of Oscar Wilde caused an absolute sensation.</v>

325
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Any friends that he still has quickly drifted away,</v>

326
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 1>both of is currently running place.</v>

327
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 1>They were canceled and his name very quickly became toxic.</v>

328
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Wilder was captain a cell in both street,</v>

329
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 1>which was that in Holloway prison,</v>

330
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Queensbury now administered the low blow or forcing a bankruptcy sale of Oscar's</v>

331
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:44.860
<v Speaker 1>belongings helped by a long list of angry creditors.</v>

332
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 1>By this time,</v>

333
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>wild was about $6,000 in debt after making sure that Oscar had nothing of any</v>

334
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:51.064
<v Speaker 1>physical value,</v>

335
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Queensberry wrote to a newspaper denying that he was capable of any sympathy for</v>

336
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>wiles.</v>

337
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 1>He stated I've helped to cut out then destroy shocks.</v>

338
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I have no sympathy for them,</v>

339
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but it felt sorry and wished to put them out of pain as fast as possible.</v>

340
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:04.520
<v Speaker 1>The trial,</v>

341
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:04.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

342
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 1>it ran from the 26th to the 29th of April.</v>

343
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It was extraordinarily explicit in its illusions to sexual acts.</v>

344
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Many coming from the young men who claimed to have been partakers various Savoy</v>

345
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>hotel employees testified that they had seen boys in Wilde's bed.</v>

346
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

347
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Oscar's council was able to point out the contradictions in testimonies,</v>

348
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>especially those if the rent's boys.</v>

349
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>This all meant that the jury,</v>

350
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>they were unable to reach a verdict,</v>

351
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>but wild he was not out of the woods as an almost immediate retrial began</v>

352
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>between the two trials.</v>

353
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 1>He did manage to secure a bale,</v>

354
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.930
<v Speaker 1>though stiffed conditions were imposed.</v>

355
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 1>He tried to stay at a number of hotels.</v>

356
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I need to be told to teach that he was unwelcome.</v>

357
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>You finally managed to find lodgings with his brother Willie.</v>

358
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.231
<v Speaker 1>The second trial.</v>

359
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It began on May the 20 seconds at the Old Bailey.</v>

360
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.910
<v Speaker 1>This time after two hours of discussion,</v>

361
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 1>the jury returned with a verdict of guilty.</v>

362
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.443
<v Speaker 1>The sentence,</v>

363
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>all it would be two years of hard labor.</v>

364
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Walter was taken to pens and Phil prison,</v>

365
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.050
<v Speaker 1>the woods in bed in his cell has sheets and rugs,</v>

366
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:08.350
<v Speaker 1>but no mattress at 10 parts was provided for his toilet.</v>

367
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.453
<v Speaker 1>The prison glades.</v>

368
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.300
<v Speaker 1>They were also not exactly his accustomed style of dress.</v>

369
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.410
<v Speaker 1>While it was also compelled to walk on a treadmill senselessly for six hours</v>

370
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.620
<v Speaker 1>each day until now to exercise outdoors for one hour.</v>

371
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.190
<v Speaker 1>He was also forced to make a postal bags for three whole months.</v>

372
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.850
<v Speaker 1>He had no outside contact and after that things were not much better with him</v>

373
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>only being allowed to write one letter.</v>

374
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.020
<v Speaker 1>The regime was absolutely brutal.</v>

375
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Wildrick calling three punishments authorized by law,</v>

376
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

377
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.273
<v Speaker 1>insomnia,</v>

378
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.060
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>

379
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.530
<v Speaker 1>In September of 1895 he received a visit from Constance who found the experience</v>

380
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.650
<v Speaker 1>awful more so than any conception of it could be.</v>

381
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Constance report it that wilds professed a rejection of his former conduct and</v>

382
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>begged her for forgiveness for his madness during the last three years.</v>

383
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.170
<v Speaker 1>She decided to stands by her week rather than wicked spouse.</v>

384
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Still she abandoned his name referring to herself as constants.</v>

385
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:00.424
<v Speaker 1>Holland.</v>

386
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.880
<v Speaker 1>When Boise heard about Oscar is rejection of his form of lifestyle.</v>

387
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.900
<v Speaker 1>He was heartbroken.</v>

388
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>

389
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I am not in prison,</v>

390
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.760
<v Speaker 1>but I think I suffer as much as Oscar and in fact more.</v>

391
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 1>That was probably not the case though because I mean prison.</v>

392
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.900
<v Speaker 1>It was obviously pretty rough.</v>

393
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.660
<v Speaker 1>In October,</v>

394
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.360
<v Speaker 1>he actually came down with dysentery.</v>

395
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Then on November the 21st he was transferred to Redding prison as Clapham</v>

396
00:17:20.351 --> 00:17:21.220
<v Speaker 1>junction station.</v>

397
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.680
<v Speaker 1>He was spat on and ridiculed by the crowds.</v>

398
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Here are the conditions.</v>

399
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:25.840
<v Speaker 1>They were improved,</v>

400
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I just duties they were lighter.</v>

401
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.660
<v Speaker 1>He was finally released.</v>

402
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.490
<v Speaker 1>On May the 19th 1896 Oscar was booked into the hotel sandwich in d app in</v>

403
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:34.324
<v Speaker 1>northern France,</v>

404
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.150
<v Speaker 1>living off the generosity of the few friends who had stood by him.</v>

405
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:37.750
<v Speaker 1>By now,</v>

406
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.170
<v Speaker 1>constants had designed it on divorce and suffering herself with spinal</v>

407
00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:41.970
<v Speaker 1>paralysis,</v>

408
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.360
<v Speaker 1>had put it off any reunion.</v>

409
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Between June and July of 1897 Oscar wrote his last major work,</v>

410
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>the ballad of reading the subjects as well that was underlining the need for</v>

411
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 1>reform in Britain's prison and justice systems like in the APP.</v>

412
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>It was excruciatingly lonely for Oscar society at large.</v>

413
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Shuns him and he spent day after day alone and miserable.</v>

414
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Finally has resolved,</v>

415
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:03.160
<v Speaker 1>collapsed hymns.</v>

416
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>He wrote to Boise inviting him to come and stay.</v>

417
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 1>They reconciled on August the 28th with wild bursting into tears at the site of</v>

418
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 1>his one true love.</v>

419
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.470
<v Speaker 1>When Constance heard of her husband's behavior,</v>

420
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.760
<v Speaker 1>she wrote to him up for bidding and he return to your filthy insane life.</v>

421
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 1>When he refused to give our Boise,</v>

422
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.760
<v Speaker 1>she cut him off completely.</v>

423
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Once the initial passion subsided,</v>

424
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 1>it became clear that to both wild and Boise were different than their pretrial</v>

425
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:27.270
<v Speaker 1>selves.</v>

426
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Boise,</v>

427
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 1>he felt a duty to help wild but this was no longer tied to love.</v>

428
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>On December the third Boise left for Naples and did not return Oscar's last two</v>

429
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:37.140
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

430
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>mostly in Paris.</v>

431
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.903
<v Speaker 1>They were pitiful.</v>

432
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 1>He drank hired men and bagged acquaintances.</v>

433
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>They were few constants.</v>

434
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Oland sadly died at age 40 after an operation on her back on April the seventh</v>

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 1>80 98 then in April,</v>

437
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 1>received the pope's blessing.</v>

438
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 1>A month later he was in Paris and suffering from ill health,</v>

439
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 1>which he attributed to food poisoning.</v>

440
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 1>His skin was irritable and then frequently came out in rashes.</v>

441
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.723

445
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.350
<v Speaker 1>it did not go well and he got worse still.</v>

446
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>He did insist on continuing to drink absent fan champagne,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll November the 25th they diagnosis of acute inoperable cerebral meningitis</v>

449
00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Oscar drifted in and out of consciousness and even sanity at half past five the</v>

<v Speaker 1>following morning at death rattle began minutes after his demise,</v>
