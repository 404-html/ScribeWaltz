1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
And the 1970s and eighties over 100 families in California had the homes

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:06.720
ransacked by the same man.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.960
Many of them woke up in the middle of the night to a flashlight,

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.030
blinding their eyes.
A man was standing over their bed wearing a black ski mask.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.210
He Hell's knives to their throats and guns to their heads,

6
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.920
demanding that they do what he said if they wanted to live within a matter of

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
hours,
he ruins and ended vives slipping small mementos into his pocket.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.890
As he ran into the darkness,

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.980
51 women were raped in their own beds sometimes while the husbands and children

10
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:36.810
watched,
he met had 12 people that we know all of this,

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.340
the kill counts maybe higher.
He traveled throughout California targeting homes.

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.630
Wherever he went,

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.190
he changed his style of killing ans left misleading clues to throw off the

14
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.290
police.
Unlike most serial killers,

15
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:53.190
there was no connection between the victims and virtually no way of predicting

16
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.570
where he would strike next.
The survivors trying to move on with our lives,

17
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:01.530
but many of them received phone calls years after the attacks hearing a

18
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.810
threatening whisper.
On the other line.

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.230
Remember when we played in 1986 the killings mysteriously stops and the trail it

20
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.070
just ran Kohl's for decades.
The serial killer was on the loose.

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
The police calls him the east area rapist or the ear for short.

22
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.410
He has also been called the original night stalker for years.

23
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:25.650
The true identity of the Ia was an unsolved mystery.

24
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.970
There's no one in California could forget.
For 44 years straight,

25
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.750
the Sacramento County Police Department received phone calls from people who

26
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.120
believed that they had information about the air,

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.360
and yet none of those suspects ever panned out.

28
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.800
A freelance writer names Michelle Mcnamara again,
the unions have this cold case.

29
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.890
In 2006 she began a blog and a podcast called true crime diary and Shanta clues

30
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:53.430
with a community of online web sleuths who are equally as passionate about

31
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.290
getting the ear behind bars.

32
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.120
In 2013 she wrote an article about the East area rapist in Los Angeles magazine

33
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.820
calls in the footsteps of a killer.

34
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.740
She gave this murderer a more fitting nickname,
the golden state killer.

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.570
She began writing a book calls,

36
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620
I'll be gone in the dark where she interviewed detectives and compiled

37
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.760
information across various jurisdictions that had never been pieced together

38
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:18.480
before.

39
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.680
She has an investigator from the Contra Costa County police departments named

40
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.150
Paul Holes and together they shared theories and information on how to

41
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:28.530
potentially catch the killer.

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.820
In 2016 Michelle Mcnamara suddenly passed away in her sleep,

43
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.080
but before she died she told her husband that the one thing she wanted was for

44
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.750
the golden state killer to get caught.

45
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.690
It didn't matter to her if she was the one to do it.

46
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.530
After taking time to grieve her husband's Patton Oswald hired helps her

47
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.270
posthumously,
published her book.

48
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.320
It was finished in February of 2018 one of the many leads,

49
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.230
Paul holds disgust with Mcnamara before she died,

50
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.590
was the potential of DNA evidence found on new genealogy.

51
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.180
Web zines like 23 and me holds,

52
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:06.160
took the DNA from old rape kits and ran it through an online genealogy database.

53
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.360
While they got him matched to a first cousin together with a task force,

54
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.860
they were able to gather enough evidence.
Defines the man who matched the DNA.

55
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.010
In April of 2018 the police raided the home of Joseph James to Angelo.

56
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.240
While we do not know the intimate details about his private life,

57
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.750
it would seem that Joseph James to Angela had a fairly normal childhood.

58
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.440
He was born in 1945 and bath New York.

59
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.120
His father also name's Joseph to Angelo was a celebrated pilots in the air force

60
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:55.650
during World War Two.
His mother,
Kathleen Grote,
was a waitress at a Denny's.

61
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.390
His parents would they to divorce.

62
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.050
Kathleen married her second husband and they moved out to California.

63
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.920
There was a piece of paper found at one of the crime scenes that may give some

64
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:06.450
insight into his childhood.

65
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.280
The paper had been named the homework evidence and it reads like a journal
entry,

66
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.230
not as the weld the weld.
That reminds me of the sixth grade.
I hated that.
Yeah.

67
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.520
Did Angelo goes on to write it down to his teacher who punished him for talking

68
00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:25.140
in class by forcing him to write the same sentence,
50 to 150 times.

69
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.090
There's a homework assignment.
I never hated anyone.
As much as I hated him.

70
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.060
He describes it spending hours on this homework and wrote,

71
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.590
it wasn't fair to make me suffer like that.
I cried because I was ashamed.

72
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.850
I will be ashamed of my sixth grade.
Yeah,
forever.

73
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.080
Some people believe that the story of the sixth grade may have been a lie.

74
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.460
It could have been a red herring to confuse the police about his motives for a

75
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:54.690
crime or it could be that he truly does see himself as a victim and he sees the

76
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:56.790
sixth grade is the turning point in his life.

77
00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.940
When he began to harbor a deep hatred for people,

78
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.640
you attended Folsom high school,
then Sacramento,

79
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.140
and then California State University in Sacramento to earn a degree in criminal

80
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:07.830
justice.

81
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.660
He joins the navy after graduation and he served in the Vietnam war in the late

82
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.900
sixties he was engaged to a young woman named Bonnie Colwell,

83
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:18.780
who worked as a lab assistant at Sierra College.

84
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.380
Bonnie calls off the engagement since it broke to Angelo's heart.

85
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.000
We may never know what happens behind closed doors,
but according to her brother,

86
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.060
she had plenty of good reasons for dumping him.

87
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.200
Just like the shame and anger he harbored towards the sixth grade teacher.

88
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.150
He never let go of this betrayal.
Years later,
victims would hear him sobbing.

89
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.110
I hate you,
Bonnie.
I hate you.
Bonnie.
Over and over again.

90
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.640
In 1973 Joseph James to Angela,

91
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.750
I married a woman named Sharon Marie Huddle Mans.

92
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.820
They would go on to have three daughters together.

93
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.150
In 1974 he graduated from the police academy and it became an officer or

94
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:56.550
endeavor,
Celia,
California.

95
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.820
The next year in 1975 a police officer was shot by a criminal known for years as

96
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.610
the Visalia ran Sacca.
Who has now been identified is Joseph James.
Angela.

97
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.390
In 1976 he transferred to the Orban Police Department.

98
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.840
He was caught stealing account of dog repellent and sends a Hannah from a

99
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.230
grocery store.
These items.
Clearly it should have been a red flag,

100
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.170
but he was up to more than shoplifting,

101
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.880
but the police fired him and they didn't look into it any further.

102
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.150
After being fired from his job to Angelo,
threatened to kill the police.

103
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.110
Chief Nick [inaudible].

104
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.950
A few days after the ink threatens the police chief's daughter ran into his room

105
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.030
in the middle of the night saying that she saw a man in a mosque outside shining

106
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.420
a flashlight into a bedroom.
When the chief went outside to check,

107
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.970
he saw shoe impressions at his daughter's window.

108
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.670
<v 0>First recorded victim was a ransacking and Visalia,</v>

110
00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:58.590
California in 1974 after to Angelo joined the police force.
In the beginning,

111
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.700
he was sloppy.

112
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:03.810
He didn't wear a mask and witnesses were able to describe his face to the
police.

113
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.400
He was 29 years old at the time,

114
00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:08.880
but he looked young for his age and many people believe the rand sacco was in

115
00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:13.710
his teens or early twenties but he would not begin to kill people until it was

116
00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:16.680
in his thirties according to a crime writer Billy Jensen,

117
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.240
he has spoken to victims.

118
00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:23.241
He believed Joseph James to Angelo attempted to murder them long before 1974 and

119
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.860
as the police sun cover new evidence about him,

120
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.800
it may reveal a much darker youth.

121
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.600
Back in the 1970s and 80s various police jurisdictions did not communicate with

122
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:36.070
one another when it came to their crimes does.

123
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:39.510
Angela would have known this fact firsthand and he took advantage of this.

124
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.000
After convincing a few crimes in one county,

125
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.970
he would simply move on to the next one,
often nearly being caught as a soccer.

126
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.470
He went to great lengths to prevent being seen and began wearing a black ski

127
00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:52.890
mask.
He also planned out strategies for each of his crimes.

128
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.580
Police sketch isn't physical descriptions were released.

129
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.140
It looks almost identical to his true face,

130
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.250
so he lost a huge amount of waste in order to change his appearance.

131
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.130
He targeted one story homes with similar layouts,

132
00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:08.700
which made it easier for him to tell how many people were in the house.

133
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.600
He'd drive around neighborhoods and sketched out maps to help him find his way

134
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:14.670
at night.
After breaking into someone's house,

135
00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:18.210
he went to search through the victim's Pason.
Look for her driver's license.

136
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.300
When he approached them in their bedrooms,
he would whisper their names,

137
00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:25.290
which made them wonder if he actually knew them in their personal lives.

138
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.490
He would also take notice of their hobbies and make up a story of where he knew

139
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:31.260
them from.
People know now,

140
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:35.730
but he chose his victims at random and he was purposefully leaving false

141
00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.070
breadcrumbs for them to follow.
For example,

142
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.310
one married couple has a boat in their driveway,
so he said,

143
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.080
I saw you at the lake.

144
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.920
Other times he would give the victims false information about himself,

145
00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:51.030
like don't tell the pigs about my van outside.
He didn't have a van.
In fact,

146
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.600
it was transportation of choice was bicycles that he would steal from open

147
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.510
guarantor's and later dump as he ran.
This way,

148
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.050
no one could identify is real vehicle and to report it to the police.

149
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.590
But the fact that he always calls police officer's pigs with all say misleading

150
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:06.600
since he was a cop himself,

151
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.220
after years of targeting women who were home alone,
raise the stakes higher.

152
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.060
We've done two couples.
He would come prepared with [inaudible] shoe laces.

153
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.960
So he could force the husband to lay on his stomach and tie his hands and then

154
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:22.080
put a stack of plates on the man's back.
If the husband's moved,

155
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.590
he said he would hear the crashing plates and he would kill the wife
immediately.

156
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.430
The husband has a lever helpless while he heard his wife being sexually

157
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.330
assaulted to Angelo switched up the weapons he used in each breaking.

158
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.210
Sometimes it was a knife.
Sometimes it was a gun.
In one case,

159
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.570
he even beat someone to death with a log from the fireplace.

160
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.680
The only comment thread he could not run away from this his own body.

161
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.210
Each of his rape victims described him as having an extremely small penis.

162
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.230
This would become a detail that investigators would take very seriously.

163
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.370
They asked local doctors if they could identify patients with a micro penis and

164
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.820
ruled out potential suspects if they were to well in doubt.

165
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.150
He wants a psychological Cedar's too got off on instilling fear into the hearts

166
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:06.210
of human beings.

167
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.470
One of the many tricks he used to avoid capture was waiting in the house long

168
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.350
after committing the rape one victim in Sacramento.

169
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.530
They dinner badge after being assaulted for several minutes.

170
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.730
Her young daughter had been laying in bed next to her the entire time and when

171
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:22.620
the mother and asked her daughter if she was okay,

172
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.870
the little girl whispered money.

173
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.920
He was still standing in the bedroom hiding in the darkness.

174
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.270
As soon as she spoke,

175
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.300
he moved toward and pushed it down on the bed next to our house.

176
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.560
He would then leave silently while there's victims remained frozen on the bed in

177
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.250
fear.

178
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.780
This gave him hours to escape before the police were called months or even years

179
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:45.300
after being raped.
[inaudible] Angelo with coolers,

180
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:47.190
victims to taught them on Christmas Day,

181
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.230
threatening to come back and finish the job.

182
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.920
Any of it's fine being victims today.
PTSD.

183
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.600
According to Carol daily,

184
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:58.590
a woman who works for the Sacramento County Police Department in the 1970s they

185
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:02.100
held a town hall meeting.
Do you discuss the East area rapist?

186
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.170
People were understandably terrified.

187
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.410
This was years before proper security systems were invented.

188
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.970
Over 6,000 guns were sold in a month.
People were hiring.

189
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:15.870
Locksmiths do add deadbolts to their doors.
As many people bought guard dogs.

190
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:16.740
To keep them safe.

191
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.200
During the town hall meetings to discuss the year a man stood up in the crowds

192
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.320
and his claims that he did not believe that the air was real because he could

193
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:29.190
not fathom that any man would allow his wife to be raped while he was home.

194
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.510
A few months later,
not the same man and his wife became victims,

195
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.130
offers a Carol daily was shaken to the core.
She knew that whoever the air was,

196
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.990
he had been at the meeting that night.

197
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:43.830
It's probably relishing in the fear that he brought to those people.

198
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.590
The Devil was hiding in plain sight.

199
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.780
<v 0>Since he could no longer work as a police officer,</v>

201
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.660
Joseph to Angela became a big rig truck mechanics,

202
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.090
but a grocery chain called Save Mart.

203
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.050
According to one of his coworkers to Angela was always on his best behavior and

204
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:11.620
it's acted like he was afraid of getting in trouble.
He was never late to work.

205
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.010
You never called in sick secretly.
He continued his crimes at night,

206
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:20.011
only stopping in the year 1986 no one knows yet why he chose that year to stop

207
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.550
his killing spree,

208
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.970
except that it was the same year that his youngest daughter was born.

209
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.960
It's possible that he reached a point where he simply could no longer continue

210
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.900
to live a double life and keep it secret from his family,

211
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.960
or perhaps he continued his crimes under a completely different emo at home.

212
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.700
They had a reputation for being an angry and violent man.

213
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.040
People in the neighborhood,
the voids and interacting with him,

214
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.990
and he never made any friends.

215
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.580
He wants left his neighbors a voicemail threatening to kill their entire family.

216
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.200
The father recognized Angelo's voice and knocked on his door to confront him to

217
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:57.670
Angela responded that he left a voicemail because that dog was barking too much.

218
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.600
His neighbors would often hear Joseph to Angelo screaming and cursing at his

219
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:05.920
wife and daughters so loudly that they could hear him inside the house.

220
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.670
He didn't seem to care what people thought of him because he frequently stood in

221
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:12.730
his front yard screaming at himself.
He would yell,

222
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.910
I'll kill you even though no one was there.
Meanwhile,

223
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:20.320
Sacramento County investigator Paul Holsten been hunting the golden state killer

224
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.500
for 24 years.
Holds was getting ready to retire,

225
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:26.350
but he was still obsessed with solving the case.

226
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.940
He was finally able to get a DNA ancestry company to agree to work with him and

227
00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:34.750
uploaded the DNA from the golden state killer into an online database.

228
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.230
In January of 2018 through this technology,

229
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:40.990
he was able to find a third cousin holes.

230
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.700
Took this to a Sacramento County da and he assigned a task force to scour this

231
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:47.640
family tree.
Before this moment,

232
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.520
Joseph to Angelo had never been one of the potential suspects.

233
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.380
He had succeeded in hiding his crimes for 44 years.

234
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.500
The day before he was supposed to hand in his gun and badge.

235
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:03.910
Paul holes sat outside of Joseph James to Angelo's house.
At this point,

236
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.810
it was so jaded by the number of failed leads over the years that he didn't

237
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.930
actually expect to Angelo to be the one holds.

238
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:15.310
Wondered if he should just knock on the Angelou's door and ask for a DNA sample

239
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.260
so they could rule them out as a suspect,

240
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.760
but something in his gut told him to keep on driving DNA samples.

241
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:24.940
They take time to process and if he truly wants the golden state killer,

242
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.690
it would have too much time to run or possibly commit suicide.

243
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.930
The police followed Angelou in public places.
Instead,

244
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.710
they retrieved his DNA and fingerprints by wiping his car door and went through

245
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:37.810
his trash to find a discarded tissue.

246
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.790
The Sacramento Crime Lab and task force worked nonstop to connect the dots and

247
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.030
prove without a doubt that he was the golden state killer.

248
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.510
The police obtained a search warrant to go into Joseph Jane's to Angelo's home

249
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:50.940
and arrest Devon's [inaudible] Angela.

250
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.830
He was shocked police on the scene since they could see it in his eyes that he

251
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:56.330
was calculating a way to escape it,

252
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:58.490
but the officers detained him before he had a chance.

253
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.180
He didn't try to deny being the golden state killer.
He simply said,

254
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.580
there is a roast in the oven.
Since then,

255
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.480
he has not spoken a word to the police and refuses to give any interviews to

256
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.610
avoid incriminating himself.
Since then,

257
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.660
he just stares into space when he appears in court.
It's Angela.
His wife,

258
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:18.140
Sharon huddle,
moved away and stopped speaking 10 decades ago.

259
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.280
At the time of his arrest,

260
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.980
he was living with one of his adult daughters and his granddaughter.

261
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.610
His wife is a divorce lawyer and yet she never filed for divorce.

262
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.530
After being separated for so many years,

263
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.100
this has led some people to speculate to that he may have threatened her or that

264
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.430
she may know something about his crimes as his wife.

265
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:37.970
She will not be forced to testify against him in a court of law and this could

266
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:41.540
possibly save her from being partially responsible for his crimes.

267
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.250
Jaron huddle released a statement,

268
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.890
basically asking the press to leave her [inaudible].

269
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.310
My thoughts and prayers are for the victims and their families.

270
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.950
The press has relentlessly pursued interviews of me.

271
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.490
I will not be given any interviews for the foreseeable future.

272
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.320
I ask the press to please respect my privacy and that of my children according

273
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:04.070
to neighbors.
To Angela was physically fit as if he was only 50 years old.

274
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.790
Instead of 72 you had a stationary bike in the house,
rode a motorcycle,

275
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.310
and it was walking around without any issue.
However,

276
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:12.080
when his lawyers rolled up to the trial,

277
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.680
you were sitting in a wheelchair pretending to be a feeble old man who didn't

278
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:20.150
know what was going on.
This was his final attempt of self preservation,

279
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.060
but he wasn't fooling anyone during the motion hearings,

280
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:24.770
Angelo was no longer in a wheelchair.

281
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.730
He was standing inside of a bard holding cell next to an armed guard.

282
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.540
He started the judge the entire time with a blank expression.

283
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.140
You showed absolutely no emotion and no remorse.

284
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.180
It will be years before he goes to trial,

285
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:42.650
but not even his defense lawyer is trying to deny that he is the golden state

286
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:43.160
killer.

287
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.120
There is also an ongoing investigation with information that is being kept from

288
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:47.750
the public.

289
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.590
The police took a lot of his personal belongings from his home in to evidence,

290
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:54.590
which included many of them are menders that he stole from his victims.

291
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.470
It may be years before we learned any more details about his life or what drew

292
00:16:58.471 --> 00:17:01.710
him to become the devil incarnate.
At the very least,
though,

293
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.060
Dangelo was finally behind bars.

294
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.570
Hopefully the victims and their families can finally get a good night's sleep.

295
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.570
