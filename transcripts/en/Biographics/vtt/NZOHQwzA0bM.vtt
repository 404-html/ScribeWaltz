1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.200
Just where we got started with this.

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.230
When I do want to address the fact that I recently covered respite in on another

3
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.220
one of my channels,

4
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:08.640
so we kind of thought is it really necessary to do it here on biographics as

5
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:12.600
well.
However,
it has been requested so much that here we are.

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.830
If you want to check out that other video,

7
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.240
I'm going to link to that below as well.
But for now,
let's get into it.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
Grigori recipes in was a Russian peasants who claimed to have mystic healing

9
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:33.480
powers and he even went so far as to see that he was the second coming of
Christ.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.390
The formed his own Culson even manipulated members of the role Romanov family

11
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.540
into believing that the truly was a holy man.

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.970
Once he had everyone wrapped around his little finger,

13
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:44.540
he used his influence over the Russian government.

14
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:49.020
Since his decisions contributed to the downfall of the remnant of dynasty for

15
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.650
years,
he claims that he struggles between the forces of good and evil.

16
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.290
Many priests believed that his power is,
didn't come from God at all,

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.890
is that he was actually the antichrist

18
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.320
regarding recipes in was born on January the 20th 1869 in east Siberia and

19
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:13.250
village called Krakow screen via Siberia had been something of a dumping ground

20
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:16.460
for Russia's criminals and there were a lot of prison colonies that were full of

21
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:17.660
men doing hard labor.

22
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.110
There were all seeing people there who had been exiled to Siberia for their

23
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.610
religious or political beliefs.

24
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.600
It is one of the coldest and most difficult places to live and survival.

25
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.270
There is a constant struggle.
Recipes and his father,

26
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:32.960
he was a peasant farmer into Korea and his mother gave birth to seven children

27
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:37.730
before he was born.
All of them died during childbirth or in early infancy,

28
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:40.870
so it was actually the first to survive the harsh Siberia,

29
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:44.470
and winter is a boy and he claims that he would have visions of the future and

30
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.730
the angels appeared to him in his dreams.

31
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.910
He knew things about his neighbors that he couldn't possibly know,

32
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:54.140
which was enough evidence to make the locals believe him.
He could heal horses.

33
00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:55.730
Who were sick just by touching them,

34
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.030
so I'm going to just believed that he was the second coming of Christ and that

35
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.890
he was simply touched by God.

36
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.970
Others believed that he was demonic and it could potentially be working with a

37
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.900
devil in his teens and early twenties it would seem that the latter is true

38
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.290
because he was apparently very badly behaved.
He would drink,

39
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.980
he would steal Lynn's head,
generally just get on everyone's nerves.

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.120
At 28 years old,

41
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.020
he was married and had four children with his wife and we met in a neighboring

42
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:21.710
village.

43
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.710
He had a reputation of being an abusive alcoholic and also cheated on his wife.

44
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.040
One day he stole a horse.
When word got out that he was a horse thief.

45
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.660
Instead of facing the consequences,

46
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.800
he gallops towards a local monastery for sanctuary and ended up staying with the

47
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:38.750
Christian brothers for several months.

48
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.800
They had convinced him to find God and changes evil ways and name's Margarie

49
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:48.440
became his mentor and he decided to actually join the order and to become a
monk.

50
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.680
He abandoned his family in favor of traveling from place to place.

51
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:54.020
Evangelizing to various villages.

52
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.130
Many historians believe that if he spent so much time walking through the forest

53
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.840
of Siberia was always guaranteed that he would run into a cult called the

54
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:05.860
Christie.
These people were an offshoot of the Russian Orthodox Church.

55
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.090
Many of their members would actually show up to a normal mass on Sunday and have

56
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.440
secret meetings in the woods.

57
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.820
They believed that salvation could only be achieved through purging sin.

58
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.450
They would perform ceremonies where they choked one another and led to go at the

59
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.700
last moment so they would get high on asphyxiation.

60
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.270
They spoke in tongues and would spin and dance until they felt drunk.

61
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.390
They work themselves into a frenzy and then fall to the ground.

62
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.380
Then they would let out of their pencil top desires by having sex with whoever

63
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:36.640
was lying next to them and a massive Audrey respiration continued to travel and

64
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.440
evangelize the Christian faith.

65
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:42.760
But this wasn't your normal run of the mill visit from someone with a Bible.

66
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.830
These monk wanderers what not allowed to bathe and recipes in sometimes wash

67
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:50.470
shackles as he walks to make himself feel pain on purpose.

68
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.830
This was supposed to be an atonement for his sins.

69
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.250
By the time he returned to his village to see his family and friends again,

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.920
he was a completely changed man.
His eyes,

71
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.080
his dad on with a frightening intensity,

72
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.500
and he said that his visions from God as they were stronger than ever,

73
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.000
even though he only just got home,

74
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:10.630
he told his wife that he needed to use the basement as a meeting place for his

75
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.980
religious group where he continued to have orgies with his Christy friends

76
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.630
one day recipes and claims that the Virgin Mary appeared before him and told him

77
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.390
to go to Saint Petersburg to help the royal family.

78
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.070
The idea that the royal family,

79
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:34.990
you could need help from a peasant man in Siberia was totally insane.
So well,

80
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.860
how on earth did someone like Rasputin's make his way into the royal palace?

81
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.810
What it sends out that he's meant from the monastery.

82
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.680
Mccurry was actually the former religious advisor to the Romanovs.

83
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.820
He was likely able to use Macquarie's connections do attract a noble clients who

84
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
believed in Rasputin's abilities and people were simply amazed at his powers.

85
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.641
Rich people.

86
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.270
They were willing to travel all the way to his small village to be healed by
him,

87
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.650
like hollering.

88
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.390
He sends a letter of introduction to one of his friends in some pieces,

89
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.170
but I couldn't.
Rasputin went on the long journey to that city.

90
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.010
He met the ship harm again and say high level priest named Sergei Triffin off

91
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.690
who is better known as Elliot.
All of us,

92
00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:14.920
the men were shocked by Rasputin's disheveled appearance.

93
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.610
He smelled truly awful and just stare.
It was terrifying.

94
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.980
He was able to dilate his eyes at will,

95
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.590
making them appear to be almost fully black,

96
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.570
but once the priest saw his healing ability,

97
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:30.370
he said that he must be a saint who was gifted by the powers of God,
the recipes,

98
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.920
and truly did norcat at all about what people thought of him.

99
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.010
He would pick his nose and eat it in front of dignified people.

100
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.380
Lynn's mark and aristocratic women for their ass.

101
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.520
He actually became good friends with princess milk.

102
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:44.710
Erin's Anastasia of Montenegro who were nicknamed of a crew sisters because of

103
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.840
the shape of their noses.
They were not Russian,

104
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.470
but they still managed to marry into the room and our family that actually both

105
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:53.140
been heavily involved in mysticism and the occult sins.

106
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.620
They both manipulated that way,
ends up marrying members of the royal family.

107
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.260
They were often treated as outcasts by the rest of the aristocracy,

108
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.740
so they bonded with recipes and took him under their wing.

109
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.860
All of this was perfect timing because Sarina Alexandra Room and office just

110
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.360
lost stuff.
First spiritual adviser,
a man named Dr Felipe.

111
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.160
She believed that he helps her in San Nicholas has a son and heir to the throne.

112
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:17.390
After having only daughters.

113
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.530
He claims on his deathbed that she would meet another hoodie man very soon,

114
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.410
who would take his place almost immediately off to this,

115
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.100
the cro sisters introduced grass boot and do the siren Sarina at a party.

116
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.640
The sisters had been the ones who help the Sarina find to previous mystic.

117
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.180
So when Alexandra learned of the stories of Rasputin's miraculous healing

118
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.540
abilities,
she knew that she wanted him to help us.
On Alexi,

119
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.490
he was born with hemophilia,

120
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.860
which is a condition that prevents the blood from clotting.

121
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.060
This means that even a small scrape can be massive blood loss.

122
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.480
They never told respites and about their son's condition at the party,

123
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.360
and it was a secret.
They had attempted to keep quiet.

124
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.140
Alexandra was still considering whether or not she could trust this peasant from

125
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:57.920
Siberia,

126
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.000
but one day I'd like to say fell Lil and scraped his knee and the bleeding was

127
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:05.180
not stopping recipes into showed up out of nowhere to the royal pilot is

128
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:06.410
demanding to see the boy.

129
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.260
He said that he had a vision from God and this and this.
Without him,

130
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.240
the prince would die.
In reality,

131
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:14.630
he most likely learned about this insider information from the cro sisters,

132
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:17.400
but to the gods and the royal family.
They were shocked.

133
00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:20.720
You wondering how we could have possibly known once he was allowed to see him.

134
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.950
He told the doctors to leave so that he could use his healing powers almost

135
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.800
immediately,
and I say actually did begin to heal,

136
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:32.330
and this was enough to convince Alexandra that he was truly a holy man who had

137
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.590
magical healing powers.

138
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.880
Watson data scientists and historians believe that this was not magic.

139
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:38.840
Surprise surprise,

140
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:43.280
but that he was actually preventing the doctors from giving Aleksi Aspirin,

141
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:47.780
which would thin his blood and only make as hemophilia was within just a few

142
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.320
months recipes and became a regular installment in the Romanov Family Mansion.

143
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.640
He began to give drugs like morphine and cocaine to the SAR,

144
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.310
claiming that they would help him with his various elements.

145
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.910
They would get high together on a regular basis.
This all became addicted,

146
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:05.000
which I already made him want respite and to come by the palace more often.

147
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.180
The Sarina would get migraine headaches and suffered from anxiety and respite

148
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:12.770
and was able to take away her pain and get it to relax.
Soon enough,

149
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:13.810
the sovereign Sarina,

150
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.680
they began to feel a dependency on him and he started to visit at least once a

151
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.990
week.
Rasputin called Alexandra and Nicholas.

152
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:23.870
Mama and Papa is if he was one of the kids,

153
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.860
he began to pray with the children at night and tell them bedtime stories.

154
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.430
This made the nanny very nervous because the oldest daughters were already

155
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:32.750
beginning to go through puberty.

156
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.320
One of the maids also claims that Rasputin had raped her.
However,

157
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:40.550
the Sarina trusted respite and so much that she accused the made of lying and

158
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:43.640
fire tower the night he tried to kick her ass Putin out of the nursery,

159
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:47.420
but the children claims that recipes and was their friends and complained that

160
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.720
the nanny was mean so well.
She was fired as well.

161
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.200
It was clear that recipe Newton's clause were deep in the royal family and her

162
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.860
to get away with just about anything.
Newspapers around some Peter's back.

163
00:08:58.861 --> 00:08:59.581
They again,
is a prince.

164
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.480
Stories about the incident saying that recipe using was very literally lessons

165
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.830
and the princesses beds,

166
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.531
recipes,

167
00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:15.100
and lived in an apartment in St Petersburg where his followers could come and

168
00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:15.910
have meetings with them.

169
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.870
Women would all show up with a hot dish and they had potluck style parties.

170
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.050
They gathered around the table with him sitting at the center recipes in,

171
00:09:23.051 --> 00:09:24.790
we'll sit in silence staring into space.

172
00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:26.740
When suddenly he would have began to mumble something.

173
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.820
The women would immediately stop talking and hopes of understanding what he was

174
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:31.654
trying to say.

175
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.260
He would then grab paper and desperately write down whatever was on his mind

176
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.390
first.
I'm insane.
Unexpectable reason.

177
00:09:37.391 --> 00:09:39.460
This was incredibly attractive to these men.

178
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.060
They believed that he was the second coming of Christ and they would offer to go

179
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:47.050
with him into his bedroom and have sex with him.
One disciple in particular,
oh,

180
00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:47.830
you're Latina,

181
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.660
had so much faith in him that she left her husband and children in audit and

182
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.590
live in his apartment.
She forced everyone to address him as got witnesses,

183
00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:59.710
opened the back door to see Olga holding his penis and screaming,

184
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.170
you are Christ and I am yours,

185
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.190
and who ever walked in on this unfortunate scene while they slowly backed away,

186
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.320
shutting the door on their way out,

187
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.700
often learning about the scandal,

188
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.610
police officers were ordered to follow him to see what he would do.

189
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.990
They reported that he would hire prostitutes on almost a daily basis and bring

190
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:20.190
them into bath houses.

191
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.760
Now you would think that if he was paying for a bath on a daily basis,

192
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:25.080
he might actually smell good.

193
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.010
According to testimony is he would bring a prostitute into a private room where

194
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:30.570
they would both get undressed.

195
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.080
He would then take his leather belts and begin beating the woman claiming that

196
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.720
he would beat the sin of lechery out of our soul.

197
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.400
Then he would have sex with errands,

198
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.430
leave the bath house without even touching the water.

199
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.670
It was once witness leaving a bath house and screaming at the demons that he

200
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:45.690
could feel inside of him.

201
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.900
He would say that he could see the devil in himself and he said that there was a

202
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:50.850
battle over a soul going on.

203
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.530
Now obviously this might sound like he was tripping on one of the many drugs

204
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:57.930
that he happened to be taking,
but remember these two priests,

205
00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:59.700
Bishop Hamon again and all well,

206
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.870
they happen to hear about Rasputin's screaming about demons in public and this

207
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:07.200
was damaging the reputation since they were the ones who introduced grass boots

208
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.850
into some Petersburg society.

209
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.480
How are they going and any and all amber Strasberg until you confront him about

210
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:13.260
what he was doing.

211
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.980
They accused him of using the devil to have these healing powers.

212
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.160
How am I getting grabbed her ass or you can buy the penis and screams that he

213
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:22.680
was thinking with that rather than his brain.

214
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.290
These do came prepared with a giant wooden crucifix,

215
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.530
which they use the beaten just about as bloody as he would beat those

216
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:32.760
prostitutes in a bath house,
but the power of Christ did not compel him.

217
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.480
Rasputin tattled on them to the Serena's saying that they were trying to murder

218
00:11:36.481 --> 00:11:38.380
him.
How am again Nancy earlier doorway.

219
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.390
Then both sent into ag and Elliot Eleodoro fled to Finland's dressed as a woman

220
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:45.750
so that no one could trace where he was going at the same time respite and

221
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:49.680
decided that he needed a break from the city and visited his home in Siberia.

222
00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.170
It turns out that and he adored.

223
00:11:57.171 --> 00:12:00.770
Trudy was trying to kill recipes and then he lays a confessed to all of the

224
00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:04.730
details in a biography.
He was convinced that Rasputin was the antichrist,

225
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.420
so he hired a disfigured prosecutor named Keyona Goosey to kill him.

226
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.770
She had been so abused by a former clients that they had cut her nose off her

227
00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:15.530
face,
just leaving a gaping hole in the door,

228
00:12:15.531 --> 00:12:19.280
told her the stories of how respite in beaten and abused of the sex workers.

229
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.090
She showed up to his village and waited for him outside of his home respite and

230
00:12:23.091 --> 00:12:25.700
received a telegram in the mail and left the house.

231
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:28.280
He needed to go to the post office to send a reply.

232
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.100
It was then that he noticed a woman standing and staring at him.

233
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.770
He decided that she looks like a perfect [inaudible],

234
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.700
so he walked over to give her some arms and preach the gospel to her.

235
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.940
When she got close enough to him,
she stabbed him in the stomach repeatedly.

236
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.110
She was so insistent on trying to kill him that she even dug our hands into his

237
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:49.280
stomach and pulls out his intestines.
On that very same day,

238
00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:52.830
Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and it was one of the many events that trigger

239
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:54.380
the beginning of World War One.

240
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.760
Instead of being by that Soren Sarina sign to give us advisement recipes and

241
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:01.820
we're stuck in East Siberia in hospital.
He knew him from his injuries.

242
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.540
After hearing the news of the impending Great War recipes and wrote a letter to

243
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.660
the SAR pleading with him to not go to war,
he wrote,

244
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.550
we will all drown in blood.
The disaster is great,
the misery infinite,

245
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.480
but the Saul did not want to listen to Rasputin for the first time in his
career,

246
00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:20.600
people were cheering for him in the streets and they were supporting fighting

247
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:22.670
for the glory of Russia,
the Sod Beth,

248
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.610
the royal palace so that he could fight with the Russian soldiers.

249
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.700
Alexandra was all alone and after Rasputin heals,

250
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.210
he returned to the royal palace and it's became a right hand advisor.

251
00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:36.320
Runs saw by proxy over the course of two years recipes and personally appointed

252
00:13:36.321 --> 00:13:40.160
several ministers of the interior,
but he was completely uneducated in politics,

253
00:13:40.161 --> 00:13:43.370
so the men be put into power were completely competence.

254
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.150
World War One was devastating.
Millions of Russian men died in this war.

255
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.020
People were struggling to find work and the cost of bread doubles on top of all

256
00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:55.520
of this.
The Serena trusted a madmen,
the entire country that had enough.

257
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.450
The Russian people,
they basically had no choice but to have a revolution.

258
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.450
Even though he's the volume of the assassination attempt to reduce Boudin's

259
00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:12.080
health began to decline and soon enough that you could no longer heal people.

260
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.280
He wrote in his journal that he knew that he would die soon and see,

261
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.520
you already had made peace with us.

262
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.000
He believed that God was about to make a sacrifice in order to save the Russian

263
00:14:20.001 --> 00:14:24.480
people similar to how Jesus Christ had died on the cross.
He wrote to Sarina,

264
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.650
Alexandra,
if one of your relations brings upon my death,

265
00:14:27.651 --> 00:14:30.770
and none of your family will remain alive for more than two years,

266
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.080
they will all be killed by the Russian people.

267
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.560
Tell your relatives that I've already paid for them and my blood,

268
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.750
I shall be killed.
I am no longer among the living,
pray and be strong.

269
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.370
During an easing in parliament,

270
00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:47.570
one of the politicians actually called respite and a dark force and said that he

271
00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:51.830
was sick and tired of this dirty peasant controlling the country and that he

272
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:56.200
would personally kill him himself if the man was not taken out of power.
Sarinor.

273
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.290
Alexandra's nephew was a man named Felix you support event.

274
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.490
He was one of the many people who wanted him dead.

275
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.270
He heard a lot about recipes and his reputation with the ladies use above was

276
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.840
married to a woman named arena and she was considered to be one of the most

277
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:10.700
beautiful women in the city of Saint Petersburg.

278
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.180
It was recommended that you support was bisexual then so that the couple were

279
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:18.110
swingers with an adventurous sex life invited respite and to join them claiming

280
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:21.080
this I Rina had taken their open relationship too far into that.

281
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:23.900
He believed that she was stricken with a sex addiction.

282
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.670
He sends that she needed Rasputin's helps you heal the demons inside.

283
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.830
Defat after gaining Rasputin's trust you support for met up with two of his co

284
00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:34.910
conspirators.
They were planning to assassinate him.

285
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.500
The men picks up respite in in a car and drove them to the use of off mansion

286
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.670
where they led him into a basement dining room.

287
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.700
The table was set up to appear as though they're just had a large party.

288
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.880
They told him that I already know is with our guests upstairs and look.

289
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:50.000
She would come downstairs later to have a healing ceremony.

290
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.630
They encouraged him to eat and drink while they waited for her.
Without in mind,

291
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:57.620
they started to hand him tiny cakes and glasses of wine recipes and had new idea

292
00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:00.410
that all of the food and drink was laced with cyanide.

293
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:01.610
Two and a half hours later,

294
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:04.490
you support could not believe this recipe to not drop dead.

295
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:08.300
Yet he began to believe the rumors that he truly did have demonic powers and

296
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.100
that poisoned would not be enough to kill him.

297
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.490
He rushed upstairs and grabbed his revolver and returned to the basement

298
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.450
pointing the gun.
At Rasputin.
The monk simply stood there staring straight ahead.

299
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.480
He did not beg for his life for show any sign of fear.

300
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.770
He short respite and crumpled down to the floor and then shared and then went

301
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:27.560
upstairs to party.
After some time into the celebration,

302
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.600
you support began to feel a sense of dread.

303
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.840
He walked down to the basement with the doctor,
runs,

304
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.110
leans in to check for a heartbeat recipe mutton's eyes opened and he lunged at

305
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:39.920
use above.
The doctor fainted on the spot,
use of pushed the demon off.

306
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:43.850
Emmons scrambled upstairs to tell his friends that were him to come back to
life.

307
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.310
They ran down to the basement and he was gone.

308
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.040
He had called up the basement stairs and with slinking his way across the

309
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.180
courtyard use above,

310
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.050
shot him point blank in the head and five other men pulled their revolvers out

311
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.300
to riddle his body with bullets.

312
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.470
They stopped Rasputin's body in the trunk of the car and driven to a river where

313
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:03.830
they shoved him in a hole in the ice.
When his body was later found,

314
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.770
his hands weren't up as if he was pressing against the ice.

315
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.270
In an attempt to escape,

316
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.260
there was even water in his lungs suggesting that he was still breathing.

317
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.720
Even after all of that,
after hearing the story,

318
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.710
people were convinced that he had truly come back to life again as a Zombie.

319
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.330
So indeed,
they dug up his body and burns the remains,
but not too before cutting.

320
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.250
Oftens preserving his legendary penis.
Indeed,

321
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.510
it is now on display in a museum and some pages back

322
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.350
soon after his death.

323
00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:37.400
Respite and his prophecy really did come through the entire Romanov family was

324
00:17:37.401 --> 00:17:41.930
executed during the Bolshevik revolution in Russia would never be the same
