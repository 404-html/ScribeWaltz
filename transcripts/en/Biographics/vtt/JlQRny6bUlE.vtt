1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.080
Viktor frankl was put through some of the most horrific struggles a human being

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.500
could imagine,
but he never lost hope and he used his experiences.

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:10.860
Do you continue as work helping other people find meaning in their lives?

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
Frankel story is one of strength of hope and to have a man who made an impact on

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.580
the world,
so let's don't even into it.

6
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
In 1905 Viktor Frankl was born the middle child of a Jewish family in Vienna.

7
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.160
His parents were government employees and the family was comfortable.

8
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.580
Then world war one hit like so many other families at that time.

9
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:46.130
The frankels had to contend with better poverty.

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.790
He and his siblings even at to go from farm to farm begging for food.

11
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.010
As the war progressed,
as a young child,

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.610
Frankel showed interest and aptitudes and the medical profession as how many,

13
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.240
three years old he wanted to become a doctor.
Then at four years old,

14
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.230
he had the realization that every human has to go through and that's the one day

15
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.330
he would die.
Still just a toddler.

16
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.720
Frankel's lifework had already started to take shape.

17
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.310
By the time he was in high school.

18
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.100
Frankl was already studying psychology and philosophy.

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.250
He even gave a speech called on the meaning of life in 1921 two years before his

20
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:21.800
graduation,
and when the answer write a final paper for graduation,

21
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.970
what else would he write on?

22
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.200
But the psychology of philosophical sought by the time he had turned 20 he had

23
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.850
already been in touch with doctor Sigmund Freud Frankel wrote Froyd to latter

24
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.070
earns included a copy of one of his own papers in s more impressively,

25
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.640
the famous doctor then requested that frank allow him to publish one of the

26
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:40.850
papers that Franklin had written later recalling the incidents.

27
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.660
Frankel still sounded like he couldn't believe the incidents even after decades

28
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:46.100
of building up his own Korea.

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.000
Can you imagine what a 16 year old's mind of Sigmund Freud asked to have a paper

30
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.360
he wrote published.
Then three years after that correspondence,

31
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.260
Frankl was walking in a park in Vienna and encountered a man who looked
familiar.

32
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.320
Frankel went up to him and asked if he was Sigmund Freud.

33
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.410
He was and when frank called began to introduce himself,

34
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.270
Freud recited Frankel's addressed to him.

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.290
Freud had been so impressed by Franco just even as the years passed,

36
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.310
he never forgot the letter that he received from the young man apart from

37
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:17.180
psychology Frankel also spent his high school years in mass in politics.

38
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.110
He began his involvement with the young socialist workers as a team and even

39
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:25.850
rose to become presidents of the organization in 1924 with a string of

40
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.270
accomplishments in the field of psychology already achieved during his teen

41
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:33.170
years.
Frankel headed to the University of Vienna to formally study,

42
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.110
has chosen fields of neurology and psychiatry.

43
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.620
Initially he based his studies in the theories and ideas that Sigmund Freud had

44
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:44.090
advanced,
but over time he began moving more towards Alfred Adler's ideas.

45
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.950
Even after moving on from Freud's ideas.

46
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:49.820
Frankel who kept a bust of the preeminence Viennese psychoanalyst in his office.

47
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.170
Freud developed psychoanalysis and added to that is with the developments of the

48
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:57.950
inferiority complex and frankly it became the third of these giants of

49
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:02.560
psychology in Vienna as he develops a search for meaning called logo therapy.

50
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.080
As a key part of the study of the human psyche,

51
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.930
but before he became a world renowned psychiatrist,

52
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.770
Frankl was making a difference much closer to him as a student.

53
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.760
He began actively putting into practice what he was learning and the theories

54
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.810
that he was developing moving beyond just academic interest in the human psyche,

55
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.670
Frankl was able to literally save lives during his time as a medical student.

56
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.810
Franco noticed a disturbing trends among students in Austria and high schools

57
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.210
when grades were reported at the end of the school term,

58
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.070
there was a spike in suicides,

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.030
Frankel spearheaded and initiative to provide free counseling to students with

60
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.690
an emphasis on helping them at the end of the school term.
Incredibly.

61
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:44.800
The very first year that Frankel's program was implemented was also the first

62
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.760
time in recent memory that the wind,

63
00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:51.700
no students suicides in Vienna with proven success in suicide prevention.

64
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.770
Frankl moved on to become the head of the Vienna Psychiatric Hospitals Female

65
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.810
Suicide Prevention Program from 1933 to 1937 he worked with thousands of women

66
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.880
who were in danger of committing suicide.

67
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.230
Then in 1937 he opened his own private practice,

68
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.110
but well,
a year later Frankel's world,
it would become upper route it.

69
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.180
In 1938 Germany invaded Austria.
Frankl was Jewish and under the Nazi regime,

70
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.270
he was not permitted to treat Arion patients.

71
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.960
The Rothschild Hospital in Vienna was the only place where Jewish patients could

72
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:31.590
be treated,

73
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.940
so Frankl was called upon to users talents them as the head of the neurological

74
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:38.520
department.
While working at Rothschild,

75
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.300
frank was also waiting to hear news that could lift him out of the terrifying

76
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:45.210
situation that so many European Jews were in.

77
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.830
He had applied for a visa to the United States and just needed his lottery

78
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.590
number to be called.
Well,
he was one of the lucky ones.

79
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.160
There's a lottery number came up before Pearl Harbor and the United States,

80
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.430
his entrance into the war,
but Frankel's decisions and leave Austria.

81
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.353
It wasn't easy.

82
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.950
The visa is applies only to Franco and not to any other member of his family,

83
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.480
his parents and siblings that'd be left behind in an even scarier environments,

84
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.530
and Franklin knew their fate was likely to end up in a concentration camp.

85
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.730
Frankel,
he knew he had a choice to make and he decided to ops on a higher power.

86
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:19.140
It's going to them in the right direction.

87
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.410
When he came across a fragments of a stone in his parents' house,

88
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.220
he knew he had found the answer.
I was looking for the state.

89
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.610
It wasn't just any old stone.

90
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.460
It was a piece of the 10 commandments that had one student,

91
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.920
a local synagogue burned down by the Nazis.

92
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.050
The synagogue was reduced to rubble and frankly,

93
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.260
his father had picked up a piece of the stone for the family to have and it's

94
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:39.420
what was the piece that he just happened to pick up?
Well,

95
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:44.100
it depicted a portion of the commandments honor thy father and mother to Franco.

96
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.050
This meant his decision was absolutely clear.

97
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.680
He would stay in Austria with his family and to be right alongside them as they

98
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.880
dealt with the Horace.
That the Nazis had brought upon them and Franco.
Well,

99
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.030
he knew the horrors analyses were capable of and he and his wife Tilly were

100
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.280
married in 1941 and the two of them wanted to have children,
but Jewish couples,

101
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.980
they were not allowed to have children.
Frankel's wife conceived,

102
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.990
but she was not allowed to give birth.

103
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.370
She was forced to have an abortion and then in 1942 what Franklin fears when it

104
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.640
came true,
he,
his wife and his parents were arrested.

105
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.450
They were initially sent a Thespian stars,
a camp in Czechoslovakia.
There.

106
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.970
Frankl did what he could to help others running a clinic,

107
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.600
helping new prisoners cope with the drastic shock of entry into a camp and

108
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:27.440
establishing a suicide watch.
Frankel,
his wife and his mother survived.

109
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:29.780
They're seeing stars that his father did not.

110
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.870
He died after any six months in the camp in 1944 Frankl was ordered to

111
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.900
Auschwitz.
His mother was also ordered to go,
but his wife was not,

112
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.570
but she was simply not going to go without her husbands.

113
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.160
She volunteered to be moved to Auschwitz.
The two ended up separators.
In the end.

114
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.910
However,

115
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.480
upon arriving at Auschwitz till he was pushed onward to Bergen Belsen while

116
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.660
Frankl and his mother were capped at Auschwitz,
at first,

117
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:57.740
they in 1500 others were kept in a shared men to hold only one sick that many

118
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:58.340
people,

119
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.430
the ground was bare and the prisoners were forced to squat for days while they

120
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:04.230
subsisted only on a small piece of bread.
From here,

121
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.560
the prisoners were directed into two lines,

122
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:09.800
one's the gas chamber and one two years of labor and misery,

123
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.200
but at least survival for the time being.

124
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.160
Franco's mother was executed in the gas chambers and Frankl himself by the

125
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:19.160
escapes that fate.
Frankl was audited to the left line,

126
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:21.440
but it's defined the order and stepped into the other group.

127
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.850
He later discovered that the left blind was the line towards the gas chamber and

128
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.040
then certain death.
He was one of the few to survive Auschwitz.

129
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.630
1.3 million people were sent through the gates of Auschwitz and 1.1 million of

130
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:33.410
them died.

131
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.710
Those who didn't die right away in the gas chamber suffered through deaths

132
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:38.570
caused by starvation disease,

133
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.140
exhaustion from forced labor and even medical experiments.

134
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.290
Though outfits was the site of a huge number of atrocities.

135
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.510
Many others suffered in camps throughout Europe.

136
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.930
Frankel's wife was one of those who met their fate in a different camp from our

137
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:51.590
husbands,

138
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.670
tinny perished at the hands of the Nazis at the camp known as Bergen Belsen and

139
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:56.690
Frankl did not learn.

140
00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:01.220
She had died until after the war had ended and he was liberated in 1945

141
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.400
throughout his time,
suffering in the camps not knowing Tillys face,

142
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.060
he was able to find meaning and is a level of comfort in the knowledge of love.

143
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.420
He thought of her throughout his ordeal in the concentration camps and

144
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.220
recognizing how that helps him.

145
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.610
He started to theorize what love meant for human life.
He needs to set,

146
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:19.430
I'll just thinking and his famous work,
man's search for meaning.

147
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.970
For the first time in my life.
I saw the truth as it is set into song.

148
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:27.140
By so many poets proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many fingers.

149
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.520
The truth that to love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire.

150
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.570
Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human

151
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:37.310
thought and belief have to impart.

152
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.420
The Salvation of man is through love and in love.
When he was in the camps,

153
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:44.960
Frankl had to distract himself from the reality of what he was going through.

154
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.680
He saw death and suffering up close.
He was forced into cattle cars,

155
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.610
forced demarche,

156
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.020
contracted typhoid fever and was separated from his most beloved family members.

157
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.410
So now you might be wondering,
well,

158
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.860
what was one way he pushed himself to survive this?
He explains,

159
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.760
I repeatedly tried to distance myself from the misery that surrounded me by

160
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:06.780
externalizing it.
I remember marching one morning from the camp to the worksite,

161
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.210
hardly able to bear the hunger,
the coals,

162
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.330
and his pain of my frozen and festering feet,
so swollen.

163
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.000
My situation seems bleak,
even hopeless.

164
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.450
Then I imagined that I stood at the lectern and a large,
beautiful,

165
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:19.470
warm and bright hall.

166
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.370
I was about to give a lecture to an interested audience on psychotherapeutic

167
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.460
experiences in a concentration camp.
The actual title.

168
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.420
I later used in the imaginary lecture I reported the things I am now living

169
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:32.850
through.
Believe me,
ladies and gentlemen,
at that moment,

170
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.920
I could not dare to hope that Sunday,

171
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.430
it was to be my good fortune to actually give such a lecture.

172
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.300
Franco Wilson made a point of finding a lesson in goodness and survival in the

173
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:44.850
suffering he endured and the suffering he witnessed.

174
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.340
These themes informed his life's work.

175
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.760
We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the

176
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:53.970
huts,
comforting others,
giving away their last piece of bread.

177
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.200
They may have been few in number as they offer sufficient proof that everything

178
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:00.690
can be taken from a man,
but one thing,

179
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.460
the last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any given set of

180
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.460
circumstances to choose one's own way.

181
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:19.250
In April of 1945 Frankl had a welcome sight,
American soldiers,

182
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.680
they had come to liberate.
To the concentration camps,

183
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.630
meaning Frankl was once again a free man.

184
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.410
He did not have family left save for a sister who had escaped to Australia.

185
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.100
He was essentially starting new in the wells that's he had his ideas,

186
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.930
his education,
and his professional experience.
So he put his ideas into writing.

187
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.010
In only nine days.

188
00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:41.240
During the summer of 1945 Frankel dictated a full manuscript.

189
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.400
The result was man's search for meaning,

190
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.390
a description of what life was like in the concentration camps and the come

191
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:48.740
inside and realizations.

192
00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:52.460
Frankel has during his time as a prisoner about the need for meaning and human

193
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.620
life and the role of suffering in the world.

194
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.590
The book served as the basic outline for longer therapy.

195
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.240
The idea of positive by Frankl.

196
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.150
There's men are most driven by a search for meaning.

197
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.260
By 1946 he was fully back into his professional weld running Vvn,

198
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:10.850
a poly clinic of neurology.
By in 1948 he has earned a phd in philosophy.

199
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.660
He began teaching at the University of Vienna where he would remain a professor

200
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.230
until 1990 after he was released from the concentration camps.

201
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.540
Frankl also remarried in 1947 he married Eleanor Schwinns Mans,

202
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.300
the two edit daughters together as an adult's Frankel's daughter.

203
00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:29.540
I followed in her famous father's footsteps and it's became a child
psychiatrist,

204
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.700
though he was teaching at the University of Vienna.

205
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.440
Frankl stitchings soon began to make a worldwide impact with Freud and Adler as

206
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:40.370
his predecessors of Vienna had already established itself as a center of

207
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:43.580
Psychological and psychiatric study,
Freud and Adler,

208
00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:47.660
where the first and second schools of Viennese psychotherapy and Frankel's ideas

209
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:50.510
about man's needing meaning in his life became the third.

210
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.730
By the mid 1950s Frankl was being invited to speak at universities around the

211
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:55.180
world.

212
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.440
He has also created to the Austrian Medical Society for psychotherapy and headed

213
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:02.700
up the organization.
In 1955 the University of Vienna,

214
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.120
they do a full professor and by 1961 he was serving as visiting professor at

215
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:10.810
Harvard and his ideas were being cemented in the minds of those studying

216
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:12.910
psychotherapy in the United States.

217
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.960
His academic career continued to grow as he lectured at over 200 universities

218
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.880
and was awarded an astonishing 29 honorary degrees.
Though,
man,

219
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:24.460
search for meaning was by far his best known work.

220
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.520
Francl also wrote and published 39 other books during his lifetime in 1970 he

221
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:33.550
was honored by his peers and they created the Viktor Frankl Institute.

222
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.430
Among his academic work,
francl still worked with patients.

223
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.190
One of his methods was to ask the most depressed patients.

224
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.190
He encountered a seemingly simple six word question.

225
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.570
Why do you not commit suicide from hair?

226
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.540
Frankl would discover what it was that the patient actually found joy in what

227
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:53.770
made their life worth living.
In other words,
what the meaning was in their life.

228
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.790
Once that was discovered,

229
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:58.030
he could help them improve their mental health and to move away from thoughts of

230
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:00.460
suicide.
As the 20th century progressed,

231
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.830
Frankel shed his ideas beyond this prince media.

232
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.320
He appeared on television to discuss his ideas,

233
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:07.480
bringing them to an entirely new audience.

234
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.730
In one of his most famous television appearances,

235
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.090
he expounded on his idea that's in the search for life's meaning.

236
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.080
One must have a balance of freedom and responsibility.
During the discussion.

237
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:20.710
He advocated for the United States to have a partner monuments for the statue of

238
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:21.280
Liberty.

239
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.940
The country should be book ended with a statue of responsibility on the west

240
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:28.270
coast.
He argued freedom,
however,
is not the last word.

241
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.990
Freedom is only part of the story in half of the truth.
Freedom is,

242
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.770
but the negative aspects of the whole phenomenon who's positive aspect is

243
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.270
responsibleness.
In fact,

244
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.920
freedom is in danger of degenerating and Zamir arbitrariness unless it is lived

245
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.370
in terms of responsibleness.

246
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.750
That is why I recommended that the Statue of Liberty on the east coast to be

247
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.500
supplemented by a statue of responsibility on the west coast,

248
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.570
answering letters and doing interviews.

249
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.440
Frankel continue to share his message and teach the world about his theories of

250
00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:57.400
psycho analysis.

251
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.260
Right up until his death in 1992 and one of his last interviews,
Frankel Maze,

252
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.530
the poignant observation that even looking back decades later,

253
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.610
you could still find value in his suffering of the concentration camps as he saw

254
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:09.850
it.

255
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.050
The suffering gave him a valuable perspective on what real trouble is making him

256
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.040
more appreciative of the life that he could live from 1946 onward.

257
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.670
What I would have given then if I could have no greater problem that I face

258
00:14:21.671 --> 00:14:22.750
today.
He sad

259
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.420
when he was in the concentration camps.

260
00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:37.350
Viktor Frankl lived out the idea that he later imparted to the weld in man's

261
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:40.050
search for meaning.
Everything can be taken from a man,

262
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:44.130
but one thing the last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any

263
00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:47.640
given set of circumstances to choose one's own way.

264
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.590
While he was in the concentration camps,

265
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:52.790
Viktor Frankl opted to think his wife to think of his profession,

266
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.320
to theorize about how he could use his experience with suffering to impact

267
00:14:57.321 --> 00:14:58.250
other's lives.

268
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.810
He stole a paper from the camp offices to jot down his ideas and his knew that

269
00:15:01.811 --> 00:15:06.320
he had two reasons to make it out alive love and a responsibility to help people

270
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:11.321
find meaning and avoid what he calls the existential stress of living without

271
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:15.320
meaning from the [inaudible] was a student's.
Frankl was helping to save lives.

272
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.630
Though he could have saved the lives of his closest family,

273
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.430
he was able to persevere through unimaginable horrors and spends the next five

274
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:26.150
decades making a positive impact on the world.
Viktor Frankl,

275
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.860
he could've given up.
He could have died.

276
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.830
He could have lived the rest of his life,
bitter from what he had to go through.

277
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.850
No one would have blamed him,
but instead,
his life has touched millions.

278
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.880
His book has been translated into 74 languages,

279
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:43.030
and he's impacted generations of new psychotherapists who will spend their lives

280
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.420
helping people.
Viktor Frankl,
a life lived with meaning.
Indeed.

281
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.480
So I really hope you found that video heartwarming.
