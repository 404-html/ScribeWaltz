<v Speaker 1>North Korea is a country shrouded in mystery.</v>

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>They do not allow their citizens to leave and they cannot receive information</v>

6
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>from the outside world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The very few people who are allowed inside or under strict supervision from the</v>

8
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the United States and the rest of the West.</v>

9
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:34.691
<v Speaker 1>We see Kim Jong Un as a communist leader who is threatening nuclear war and</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>violating human rights,</v>

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>and we also see them as someone who's had a hand in a number of assassinations</v>

12
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>of his enemies.</v>

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.953
<v Speaker 1>For some people,</v>

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>that's all they need to know to form an opinion and they imagine that he is an</v>

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:48.800
<v Speaker 1>evil dictator or on par with that of Hitler.</v>

16
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>But the truth about this man,</v>

17
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>it's far more complicated.</v>

18
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Before we get into the details of Kim Jong,</v>

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it's important to understand a little bit of history about North Korea.</v>

20
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.793
<v Speaker 1>During World War Two,</v>

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Japan was occupying Korea and the country fell into a state of extreme poverty.</v>

22
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>They became independent again in 1945,</v>

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>but the country was now a rock bottom.</v>

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>It was extremely difficult to raise the economy out of the depression,</v>

25
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>especially since they were years behind the western world in terms of</v>

26
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing and transportation.</v>

27
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>This desperate time made some citizens open to the ideas of communism where the</v>

28
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 1>government is responsible for providing food,</v>

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>

30
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>and employment to its citizens.</v>

31
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.013
<v Speaker 1>The USSR,</v>

32
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>it was eager to help,</v>

33
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:46.240
<v Speaker 1>so Russia provided weapons to North Korea and it split off from the south.</v>

34
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>In 1948,</v>

35
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>the leader was a man called Kim.</v>

36
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Il Sung.</v>

37
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

38
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>things were actually going quite well.</v>

39
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Kim Molson kept his promises.</v>

40
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>He improved agriculture and no one was hungry anymore.</v>

41
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>He brought industrialism to the country which gave the citizens jobs.</v>

42
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>They built up the capital city of Pyongyang and the country was progressing very</v>

43
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

44
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.271
<v Speaker 1>For years.</v>

45
00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>North Korea was actually a head of South Korea in progress.</v>

46
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>People loved him.</v>

47
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Nelson,</v>

48
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.581
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

49
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>they loved him so much.</v>

50
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>They called him the supreme leader and began making up legends that he was a</v>

51
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>guard with supernatural abilities,</v>

52
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>but in 1950,</v>

53
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>the Korean War began and the USSR and China teamed up with North Korea and their</v>

54
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>attempts to take over the south.</v>

55
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.840
<v Speaker 1>The United States fought on the side of democracy and so they helped South Korea</v>

56
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>win back their territory.</v>

57
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 1>American soldiers are still stationed at the border to this very day,</v>

58
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>even though the war was nearly 70 years ago in the North Korean version of</v>

59
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:42.221
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

60
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 1>America attacked first and they were just defending themselves.</v>

61
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>This trick of years of NZ,</v>

62
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>American propaganda runs a ban on all American made products and the feeling is</v>

63
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>definitely mutual.</v>

64
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>The United Nations creative trade embargoes against North Korea and refuse to</v>

65
00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>work with any communist nation.</v>

66
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>After the collapse of the USSR in 1991 North Korea,</v>

67
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>it ran out of money and triggered a widespread famine where citizens were,</v>

68
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

69
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>starving people struggled to survive.</v>

70
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>This was no longer the utopia that Kim Il Sung had envisioned into son Kim Jong.</v>

71
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Il was doing very little to fix anything during his reign.</v>

72
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.891
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

73
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>he exploited his power to the fullest extent and did things that were truly</v>

74
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.691
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

75
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>which only made North Korea as reputation.</v>

76
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Even worse,</v>

77
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il had several children with multiple mistresses,</v>

78
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>at least three sons and two daughters are known to the public.</v>

79
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Kim Dragoon was his third son,</v>

80
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>born in 1983,</v>

81
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost was one of the few neutral countries that were willing to work</v>

82
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>with North Korean diplomats.</v>

83
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Therefore Kim Jong Il centers,</v>

84
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>children to boarding school.</v>

85
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>That boom was given the alias of pack on.</v>

86
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>He got to experience a normal childhood living in an apartment with a family who</v>

87
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>worked at the Swiss embassy.</v>

88
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>He was given lessons on how to speak German,</v>

89
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but he had to enter a class of students who were two years younger than him in</v>

90
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>order to catch up on the reading level.</v>

91
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>At first he struggled,</v>

92
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but he was eventually able to make good friends with the other children.</v>

93
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>His teachers say that he enjoyed playing game boy and his favorite sport was</v>

94
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

95
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>He was an average students who enjoy gym class far more than academic subjects.</v>

96
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>He wore different in like tracksuits every single day to school at home.</v>

97
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>He loved watching the NBA and American action movies.</v>

98
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>His mother was one of Kim Jong Il's mistresses,</v>

99
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>an opera singer named Koh young here.</v>

100
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>She would fly back and forth from North Korea on a private jet in order to visit</v>

101
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

102
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>sometimes staying for several weeks at a time.</v>

103
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It was able to visit several countries in Europe and Japan and spent most of his</v>

104
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>young life learning about the world outside of North Korea.</v>

105
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>When he was 17 years old,</v>

106
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>he was taking high school classes and preparing for graduation.</v>

107
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>One day pack didn't come to class and everyone assumes that he was out sick,</v>

108
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>but days turned into weeks and he never came back.</v>

109
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>He was ordered to leave,</v>

110
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>so suddenly that he never even got to say goodbye to his friends.</v>

111
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He had begun taking college classes in North Korea.</v>

112
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>He was never allowed to tell anyone about the secrets of the outside world since</v>

113
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>the entire nation was still living like it was frozen and some sort of time</v>

114
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>capsule from the 19 sixties.</v>

115
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.693
<v Speaker 1>His older brother,</v>

116
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Nam,</v>

117
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>was originally supposed to become the new leader of North Korea.</v>

118
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>The second son surely is described as being very feminist and not appropriate</v>

119
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>for a fierce leader.</v>

120
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Boone was third in line for successions,</v>

121
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>so growing up he never really expected to take on that responsibility.</v>

122
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

123
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>the eldest brother,</v>

124
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

125
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>he got himself into a lot of trouble in 2001 now and was caught using fake</v>

126
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>passports while trying to take his family to Tokyo Disneyland and they got all</v>

127
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:40.354
<v Speaker 1>over the news.</v>

128
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>His carelessness made members of the North Korean elites lose trust in his</v>

129
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>abilities for the next two years.</v>

130
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm would openly criticize the way his father was running the country in</v>

131
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>2003.</v>

132
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>He was exiled from North Korea and 20 year old who was told that his older</v>

133
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>brother was gone.</v>

134
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>He would need to become the next supreme leader.</v>

135
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>When Kim Jong Il had his first stroke and was 25 years old,</v>

136
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>his advisors knew that it was time to begin teaching him how to become the new</v>

137
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:06.840
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

138
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Ivr,</v>

139
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>when his father died in 2011,</v>

140
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>only had only had about a year of political training at this point,</v>

141
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>but it was too late.</v>

142
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>At 26 years old,</v>

143
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:20.291
<v Speaker 1>he became the dictator of North Korea once he was revealed to the nation as</v>

144
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 1>their new supreme leader.</v>

145
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>People are skeptical about his young age,</v>

146
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>but they also loved him right away.</v>

147
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.480
<v Speaker 1>He was very friendly and mild manners,</v>

148
00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>and he reminded me a lot of people have his beloved grandfather,</v>

149
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.803
<v Speaker 1>Kim Il Sung,</v>

150
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>the superstitious Korean people began to remove.</v>

151
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a reincarnation of his grandfather who had come back from the</v>

152
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>dead in order to bring North Korea back to it's former glory.</v>

153
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.120
<v Speaker 1>There are very few living people and outside of North Korea who knew Kim Jong Un</v>

154
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>well enough to be able to testify for his character.</v>

155
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Kenji Fujimoto is a chef from Japan who was hired by Kim [inaudible] to cook his</v>

156
00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 1>meals and they became good friends after unwritten time for studying abroad.</v>

157
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.720
<v Speaker 1>What'd you motor was one of the very few people who he could talk to you openly</v>

158
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>about the outside wells.</v>

159
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>He marveled at the fact that foreign grocery stores were always filled with food</v>

160
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Speaker 1>in North Korea and were always empty or knew that there was something deeply</v>

161
00:07:19.531 --> 00:07:22.110
<v Speaker 1>wrong with this country and he wanted to make it better.</v>

162
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>He can find it in Fujimoto this,</v>

163
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 1>when he became the new leader,</v>

164
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.480
<v Speaker 1>you plan to model North Korea's economy after China whose wealth and boomed from</v>

165
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>that production and worldwide distribution in 2012 when he gave his first speech</v>

166
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:35.924
<v Speaker 1>is the new leader,</v>

167
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN declared that this would be a new North Korea,</v>

168
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.910
<v Speaker 1>and all the struggles were behind them.</v>

169
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.590
<v Speaker 1>When he came into power children,</v>

170
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.570
<v Speaker 1>they were still dying of malnutrition.</v>

171
00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:49.380
<v Speaker 1>In this first mission was to make sure that his people had enough to eat.</v>

172
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>He spoke about his immense respect for the loyalty of his people and how they</v>

173
00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:55.350
<v Speaker 1>deserved so much better.</v>

174
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

175
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.880
<v Speaker 1>all people should never have to tighten their belts again.</v>

176
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.991
<v Speaker 1>From day one.</v>

177
00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN has made an effort to be the polar opposite of his father,</v>

178
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:04.951
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong.</v>

179
00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Il never made a single public speech.</v>

180
00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 1>During the course of his reign,</v>

181
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.820
<v Speaker 1>he kept US citizens out of the loop and completely avoided interacting with</v>

182
00:08:11.821 --> 00:08:12.090
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

183
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 1>His father and his friends in the elite class enjoyed a life of luxury.</v>

184
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Any help from charities from the outside world went to feeding the rich.</v>

185
00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:24.300
<v Speaker 1>While baby's continued to die of starvation every single day,</v>

186
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] hats undo decades of damage done by his father.</v>

187
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It would take time,</v>

188
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 1>but he kept his word.</v>

189
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to set out new economic and agricultural reforms that brought more</v>

190
00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:36.840
<v Speaker 1>food to the people within a year or two.</v>

191
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.510
<v Speaker 1>People are healthy again and was a young,</v>

192
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.840
<v Speaker 1>possibly naive man with big hopes and big dreams.</v>

193
00:08:42.841 --> 00:08:46.200
<v Speaker 1>He truly did want to use his position of power to fix this country,</v>

194
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 1>but he would soon find out so this even in the position of supreme leader,</v>

195
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 1>some problems are far too complicated for a single password to fix.</v>

196
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Before Kim Jong Un came to power,</v>

197
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>generals were national heroes and they were all a part of an elite class in</v>

198
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:07.554
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

199
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the power in government was with these military leaders.</v>

200
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Many people don't realize that North Koreans call their country the DPRK,</v>

201
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>which stands the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,</v>

202
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>but the People's Republic was clearly lacking the funding and power that it</v>

203
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>needed.</v>

204
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>One of Kim Jong Young's first executive decisions was to remove all of the power</v>

205
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>from the military and give some of it back to the people and their</v>

206
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>representatives.</v>

207
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.910
<v Speaker 1>His Uncle Jang song fake was a decorated general,</v>

208
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:38.450
<v Speaker 1>so this executive order stripped away much of his political power before Kim</v>

209
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Jong Il died.</v>

210
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>There was some speculation that Jang Song Faq would become the new leader of the</v>

211
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:44.940
<v Speaker 1>country since we're still so young.</v>

212
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>For the first year of his reign,</v>

213
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Jenkinson Faq offered his nephew some guidance in how to run the governments,</v>

214
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 1>but it was clear that he was just trying to be a puppet master.</v>

215
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>This one lasted for about a year and 2013.</v>

216
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN ordered the execution of his uncle.</v>

217
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>He was shot by a firing squad in the past,</v>

218
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:05.130
<v Speaker 1>whenever there was a sudden death of a member of the elite.</v>

219
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knew that it was an execution,</v>

220
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>but the government would explain it away by saying it was a car accident or a</v>

221
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>heart attack or something like that.</v>

222
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN shock to the public by saying that yes,</v>

223
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>he was the one who had had his uncle killed because his uncle was trying to</v>

224
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>overthrow him and take the position of supreme leader for himself in North</v>

225
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

226
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.440
<v Speaker 1>If someone commits a serious crime that are only really three options,</v>

227
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>send them to a prison camp,</v>

228
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>kill them or exiled them.</v>

229
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Considering how much power Jenksen Faq had the North Korean military killing him</v>

230
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

231
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Really the only option Kim Jong them or say kills many of the men who were</v>

232
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 1>helping his uncle plan the queue for the other military leaders running the</v>

233
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:43.650
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

234
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Un forced them into retirements and replace them with people that he</v>

235
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 1>knew he could trust.</v>

236
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>It was later revealed in the international press that his uncle was a pedophile</v>

237
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>and he had an arrangement with Kim Jong Il when he was still alive.</v>

238
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 1>They targeted extremely young girls.</v>

239
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 1>He would audition to be a part of some artistic role.</v>

240
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I need to become his play things.</v>

241
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>He had these young girls bathe his naked body daily.</v>

242
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Basically why we're not trying to promote murder,</v>

243
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 1>killing Jameson Faq with a firing squad was letting him off easy.</v>

244
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>You can get to what inmates would have done to him in the US prison system.</v>

245
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

246
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>the western media latched onto this story saying he went on a killing spree.</v>

247
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Speaker 1>This was also very shocking for North Korean citizens do.</v>

248
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:28.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

249
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 1>because they are a culture that deeply respect their elders.</v>

250
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

251
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is still very sheltered from the outside world.</v>

252
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN has actually made a lot of efforts.</v>

253
00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 1>You slowly incorporate modern life into the DPRK.</v>

254
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 1>He has invited in groups from around the world to entertain and teach people in</v>

255
00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>things that that never seen before.</v>

256
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Like a group called SAF,</v>

257
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:55.954
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

258
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

259
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>these are special privileges that are reserved for the elite class.</v>

260
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.650
<v Speaker 1>It has also allowed North Koreans access to smartphones,</v>

261
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

262
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and hd televisions.</v>

263
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Students are also learning computer programming in university.</v>

264
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.461
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

265
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>they cannot get access to the worldwide web and there's only one TV channel and</v>

266
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>that's used for state propaganda.</v>

267
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.101
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

268
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>those phones can only make calls locally and all of this is still only</v>

269
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>affordable for people in the upper class.</v>

270
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN began sending his country's current and future leaders to schools in</v>

271
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>

272
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

273
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Canada runs Hong Kong in order to receive a proper education and economics and</v>

274
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:31.234
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

275
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 1>He hopes that they will return with a better understanding on how to change the</v>

276
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 1>North Korean governments and help transition their economy into a free market.</v>

277
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Many people get access to dvds and flash drives smuggled in from China with</v>

278
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>South Korean TV shows and movies.</v>

279
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>It is now common for citizens who own tvs and computers to see what the outside</v>

280
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.960
<v Speaker 1>world is truly like.</v>

281
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Even though I'm not allowed to leave.</v>

282
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

283
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>made an unlikely friendship with a professional basketball player.</v>

284
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Rodman in,</v>

285
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:58.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

286
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 1>2018 interview with CNN Rodman explained that he wanted to give Kim Jong UN</v>

287
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.090
<v Speaker 1>present for his birthday by flying over and American basketball teams in North</v>

288
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

289
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.360
<v Speaker 1>No one in the country had ever seen an NBA game before.</v>

290
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Despite the difficulty getting into the country.</v>

291
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Rodman was able to pull it off,</v>

292
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong and told him,</v>

293
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>this is the first time someone has ever kept their word to me.</v>

294
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 1>He went on to explain that people usually spout false promises about trying to</v>

295
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 1>make peace with this country and that makes it nearly impossible to trust any</v>

296
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:28.324
<v Speaker 1>outsiders.</v>

297
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.910
<v Speaker 1>For the people who have defected into South Korea.</v>

298
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:33.550
<v Speaker 1>They say that the transition comes as a shock.</v>

299
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>There are so many more lights causes people than they are used to.</v>

300
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Actress he owned me.</v>

301
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Park says that she is always studying very hard to catch up to our peers by</v>

302
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>learning how to read and write the Korean language and catch up to everything</v>

303
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 1>there is to know about the outside world.</v>

304
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 1>We will never be able to read Kim Jong Un's minds to see his long term goals.</v>

305
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 1>If the truth of the outside world was brought to these people who have been</v>

306
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>living in isolated and depressed life for so many years,</v>

307
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 1>it would be a revolt and Kim Jong widow loses power.</v>

308
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>If he wants to open North Korea up to the rest of the world,</v>

309
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that can be done overnight.</v>

310
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Remember that these people are essentially stuck in a time capsule at this</v>

311
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

312
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Exposing them to the outside world all at once would be incredibly overwhelming</v>

313
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>and it may lead to bloodshed.</v>

314
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:23.650
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if he is more concerned with keeping people oppressed to maintain</v>

315
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:24.311
<v Speaker 1>this power.</v>

316
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 1>If he knows that the process of globalization in North Korea will take time,</v>

317
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 1>what we can do is speculate</v>

318
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.710
<v Speaker 1>when he was alive and his father helped himself to a higher and the actresses</v>

319
00:14:40.711 --> 00:14:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and singers,</v>

320
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay arranged for his three sons to have the ability to sleep with any woman</v>

321
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:46.044
<v Speaker 1>that they want it,</v>

322
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but according to Kenji Fujimoto,</v>

323
00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:51.090
<v Speaker 1>the teenaged simply wasn't interested in sleeping around.</v>

324
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>He was very protective of his younger sister and showed a lot of respect towards</v>

325
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 1>women in general.</v>

326
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 1>You fads to read books,</v>

327
00:14:57.591 --> 00:14:58.281
<v Speaker 1>watch movies,</v>

328
00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 1>and play basketball over partying and going on dates which you to was so shocked</v>

329
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 1>by the boys' disinterest in the heart.</v>

330
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And he often wonders if the boy was actually gay.</v>

331
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>One day though and made comments that confirms to Fujimoto that he did in fact</v>

332
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:15.230
<v Speaker 1>like girls just as much as any other teenage boy.</v>

333
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.240
<v Speaker 1>He just wanted to fall in love.</v>

334
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Ung is married to a woman named result Jew.</v>

335
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>She was a singer in her younger years,</v>

336
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 1>but often Mary and Kim Jong.</v>

337
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 1>She began pursuing a college degree in science and completed a phd.</v>

338
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 1>The details about that relationship will kept secrets and then marriage was only</v>

339
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:36.620
<v Speaker 1>announced in 2012 after he became the new leader of North Korea.</v>

340
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

341
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>some say that they had already been married for years before.</v>

342
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Then as first lady resells who enjoys organizing events for how husbands and she</v>

343
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>is often seen accompanying him in public.</v>

344
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 1>While this seems totally normal to the outside world,</v>

345
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Un is actually the first North Korean leader who allowed his wife to be</v>

346
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:53.894
<v Speaker 1>seen in public.</v>

347
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>He also brings along his sister arms and one of his father's former consorts</v>

348
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>with him to events because they are part of this inner circle of advisors.</v>

349
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.830
<v Speaker 1>While may never know the intimate details of his marriage,</v>

350
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>that body language shows that they are very loving with one another.</v>

351
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 1>According to Dennis Rodman,</v>

352
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:09.640
<v Speaker 1>he met one of their daughters,</v>

353
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.260
<v Speaker 1>a little girl names Jua.</v>

354
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Many have speculated that he has multiple children,</v>

355
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:18.050
<v Speaker 1>but they've never shown in the public eye to protect their anonymity.</v>

356
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 1>They are reportedly receiving a private education abroad just like their father</v>

357
00:16:21.831 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

358
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Instead of relying on a mail outs take over his throne.</v>

359
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN has been paying for the training.</v>

360
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It was youngest sister Kim Jong so that she can become the new supreme leader of</v>

361
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:33.710
<v Speaker 1>the country if anything should happen to him.</v>

362
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>She is usually present during very important meetings with national leaders.</v>

363
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Bali is better than his father and just about every way.</v>

364
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Un is far from being the perfect leader.</v>

365
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.000
<v Speaker 1>North Korean citizens aren't still not allowed to come and go from the country</v>

366
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:54.834
<v Speaker 1>as they pleased.</v>

367
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.920
<v Speaker 1>As a communist nation.</v>

368
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.620
<v Speaker 1>People are not allowed to choose their own career.</v>

369
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.891
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

370
00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't have freedom of speech or religion and the press is a never ending</v>

371
00:17:03.061 --> 00:17:04.170
<v Speaker 1>propaganda machine.</v>

372
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.580
<v Speaker 1>One of the main criticisms,</v>

373
00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:09.100
<v Speaker 1>he receives this for the harsh treatments of prisoners in the Gulags,</v>

374
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:10.290
<v Speaker 1>in the concentration camps,</v>

375
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 1>prisoners are being used for uranium mining and their bodies have been riddled</v>

376
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.210
<v Speaker 1>with radiation considering that he wants to keep up with his nuclear arsenal.</v>

377
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Uranium mining has become a necessary evil.</v>

378
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.161
<v Speaker 1>Then of course,</v>

379
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:26.430
<v Speaker 1>there's the facts that Kim Jong Un has made multiple threats of nuclear war</v>

380
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.990
<v Speaker 1>against the United States.</v>

381
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.310
<v Speaker 1>This is an incredibly frightening thing to think about and it has any Americans</v>

382
00:17:32.311 --> 00:17:32.910
<v Speaker 1>on average.</v>

383
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.241
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

384
00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:34.980
<v Speaker 1>when you interviewed South Koreans,</v>

385
00:17:34.981 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 1>not many people are worried despite the fact that they live right next door,</v>

386
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but they believe that Kim Jong Un's nuclear threats,</v>

387
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 1>so the only thing that the country has for leverage in order to prevent a more</v>

388
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:45.660
<v Speaker 1>powerful nation from invading.</v>

389
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Remember there are thousands of American troops at the border and with all other</v>

390
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 1>major powers in the world owning nuclear weapons.</v>

391
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 1>This is just a way for them to become on level with mutually assured</v>

392
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:56.430
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

393
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that no presidents in their right mind would attack a country who has</v>

394
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons at their disposal because it would mean both countries would be</v>

395
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.230
<v Speaker 1>obliterated evenly.</v>

396
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Military training is a requirements for every citizen in North Korea.</v>

397
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong never received any,</v>

398
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but the North Korean propaganda machine has built up this myth that he was sent</v>

399
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 1>away to receive some of the best military training in the world,</v>

400
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 1>so he runs military drills do keep up this illusion he was given.</v>

401
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.030
<v Speaker 1>The equivalent ranking is a three star general.</v>

402
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.840
<v Speaker 1>None of the young soldiers have ever been to war and the military leaders from</v>

403
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 1>the Korean world that will gone further.</v>

404
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has outdated weapons that were given to them by the Soviet Union</v>

405
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.120
<v Speaker 1>decades ago,</v>

406
00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>and while they are dangerous and there was no way they could ever win a war if</v>

407
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 1>they took on South Korea.</v>

408
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 1>A man named Robert Colin is a CIA negotiated with North Korea and he sums up the</v>

409
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 1>grand show of nuclear power perfectly.</v>

410
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 1>One thing every North Korean leader has understood,</v>

411
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 1>and Kim Jong Un does too,</v>

412
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.460
<v Speaker 1>is that if they lower their god,</v>

413
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 1>they will be treated by the major powers as the used furniture of history.</v>

414
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 1>They will simply be discarded,</v>

415
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.580
<v Speaker 1>walkover ignored otherwise,</v>

416
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 1>why pay any attention to them so they have to make sure people care about them.</v>

417
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.360
<v Speaker 1>In 2018,</v>

418
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN matched with the president of South Korea Moon Jay and the</v>

419
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Speaker 1>presidents of the United States,</v>

420
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.333
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

421
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 1>in order to bring their countries to a place of peace where progress can be</v>

422
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

423
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 1>we can only hope that there will be a solution to this incredibly complicated</v>

424
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.980
<v Speaker 1>situation without ever going to war.</v>

425
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 1>So Kim Jong UN and North Korea scary stuff and you know what else is scary</v>

426
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 1>hackers and not just off the governmental variety.</v>

427
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I might sort of be joking.</v>

428
00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 1>It chances all your data isn't really interesting to North Korea,</v>

429
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:38.601
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

430
00:19:38.601 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 1>every day we hear about in the news how the some sort of latest hack or data</v>

431
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>breach of some variety,</v>

432
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.001
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

433
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>And governmental surveillance is certainly something that goes on.</v>

434
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:48.751
<v Speaker 1>But good news,</v>

435
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you can protect yourself with a vpn and that's where Nord vbn comes in.</v>

436
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I've been sitting in a cafe with some open wifi network and I wanted to check</v>

437
00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:59.080
<v Speaker 1>your internet banking world.</v>

438
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't even think about it without nor to Vpn or let's say you were a foreign</v>

439
00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 1>person living in an oppressive dictatorship with very restricted internet and</v>

440
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to watch a funny youtube video like this one very matter.</v>

441
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

442
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

443
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Nord vpm will sort you out there too,</v>

444
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.630
<v Speaker 1>or maybe more likely,</v>

445
00:20:16.631 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you just want to watch gold local content from your own country while abroad.</v>

446
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Well nor vpn can also do that.</v>

447
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Nor vpn is also super fast,</v>

448
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:26.790
<v Speaker 1>so watching video is a breeze,</v>

449
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 1>no lag whatsoever.</v>

450
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever used vpns and thought they were slow,</v>

451
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:32.660
<v Speaker 1>while that's certainly not the case with Nord,</v>

452
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you can also use it on all your devices very,</v>

453
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:35.971
<v Speaker 1>very easily.</v>

454
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:36.511
<v Speaker 1>Android,</v>

455
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:37.050
<v Speaker 1>chrome,</v>

456
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.621
<v Speaker 1>windows,</v>

457
00:20:37.621 --> 00:20:38.454
<v Speaker 1>Linux,</v>

458
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>and on six different devices at the same time,</v>

459
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:42.750
<v Speaker 1>all with one account.</v>

460
00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 1>So that makes it incredibly affordable also that are no logs kept.</v>

461
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Unlike some companies based in the EU or the United States,</v>

462
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 1>north vpn based in Panama,</v>

463
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.920
<v Speaker 1>they don't keep logs at all.</v>

464
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like the opposite of North Korea.</v>

465
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Great for your privacy.</v>

466
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

467
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.540
<v Speaker 1>they are the only vpn to get a perfect score from pc mag,</v>

468
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 1>nor vpn is offering.</v>

469
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.800
