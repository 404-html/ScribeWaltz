3
00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.410
but few have been as depraved as the man who absolutely brutalized Uganda

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.610
throughout the 1970s with his pension for torture severed heads,

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.190
and it's by his own admission cannibalism.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.930
He thoroughly deserved the description given to him by the man he replaced as

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.960
Ugandan presidents,
Milson a boat,

He had very little formal education but was versed in the teachings of the Koran

13
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.240
from a very early age.
In fact,

14
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.990
he developed a reputation as the boy who could recite the Koran in his early

15
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:01.411
teens.

16

He had grown into a tall,
strapping young man.

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.450
He spoke the Kiswahili language and he had little education,

22
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:23.400
meaning he would readily follow orders.

23
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
These were all seen as desirable traits and the officer pulled some strings to

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.870
allow him to enter the British colonial army.

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.820
In 1946 it he began his military career as the laundry worker in the Margaret

26
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.070
Margaret barracks in junior.
After a year of this,

27
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.520
he advanced to the 21st King's African rifle core at g league.

28
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.750
Shortly thereafter,

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.700
his unit was relocated to Somalia and he proved to be a keen,
eager soldier,

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.040
his courage,
boldness,
and cruelty.

31
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.870
What traits that Martin as a standout private after hunting down shift to animal

32
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.920
Raiders in Somalia,

33
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.120
he was sent to Fort Hall where he began training for the Scottish military
bands.

37
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.310
well.
There's an accomplished swimmer

38
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.940
over the next two years.
Idi Amin data established himself as an ideal soldier.

39
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.110
One report described him as an incredible person who has certainly not mad,

40
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.000
very shrewd,
very cunning,

41
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.670
and a born leader and other report commented on his physical and mental ability

42
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:38.110
at stating a splendid and good rugby player,

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.910
bit of virtually bone from the neck up and needs things explained in words of

44
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:45.310
one letter in 1952 I'm in.

45
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.690
His Brigade was dispatched to Kenya to fight against the Mau Mau rebellion.
Yeah.

46
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.230
He undertook foot patrols in the jungle to root out the rebels.

47
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.250
His initiative was rewarded by promotion for us to corporal and then to

48
00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:59.590
sergeants.
By the end of 18 three here,

49
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.500
Dan's the highest strength that a black officer could attain in the British

50
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.470
colonial army,
and that was the [inaudible].

51
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.340
This was the equivalent of a warrant officer housing down the Mau Mau.

52
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.480
It wasn't the only thing that I'm in.
Did wanting Kenya during those two years.

53
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:16.510
He also fathered two children,
a boy and a girl.

54
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.780
They were to be the first of 35 children born by five wives.

55
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.680
In 1954 I'm in his brigade returns to their base that ginger and Uganda,

56
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.380
when Queen Elizabeth Taught,
he was in the Scottish army.

57
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.500
Band's winning the distinction of being named the best in parade.

58
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.740
In 1957 he led a movement among the native soldiers to get increased salaries.

59
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.280
The initiative it failed,

60
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.810
and the army brass expressed displeasure at this upstart move from Nestar.

61
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:48.220
Soldier disappointment came when he twice failed the military intelligence test.

62
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.320
As a result,
he was transferred from the fields,

63
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.330
do the king's African rifle core bands.

64
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.830
Then in 1959 he passed the army field exercise examined was permitted once more

65
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.930
to serve in the field of combat.

66
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.950
He was posted to the border between Kenya and Uganda and here there was a bit of

67
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.900
rivalry between the Ugandan Carramar Gong ans the Kenyan to kind of nomads.

68
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.550
He arrives in the wake of a crushing British defeat at the hands of the Takata

69
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.960
performed so well.

70
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.860
There's a British officer described I'm in as having restored the prestige of

71
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.740
the forces of law and order in the region of Karamoja.
In fact,

72
00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:25.540
I'm in now promoted to 10 and twist responsible for negotiating a peace

73
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.420
agreements with the Tacoma leader,
Edward Matea.

74
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.160
I'm in his means of achieving his ends on all the docs.
Do you see the least?

75
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:36.340
He threatened to cut off the penis of every TACAN,

76
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.390
a man who was found to be rustling cattle,
and this wasn't just bluffing.

77
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.540
He followed through on this threat and much more.
In fact,

78
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.030
he bloody manner in which he crushed the rebellion,

79
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:50.080
brought a level of ferociousness to the area that was simply unprecedented.

80
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.210
In 1962 you're going to one independence from Great Britain.

81
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.580
Suddenly the nation had its own army,

82
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.600
whereas previously the native brigades had been treated as second class soldiers

83
00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:09.530
by the British and we're doing the bidding of that colonial overlords now.

84
00:05:09.531 --> 00:05:11.300
They were free of those shackles.

85
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.740
A large number of British officers remained in Uganda to oversee the emergence

86
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:20.510
of the Ugandan army as early as 1964 and began making moves to gain military

87
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.100
strength within the Ugandan army.

88
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.640
His actions in putting down the Takotna rebellion brought him to the attention

89
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:28.280
of Uganda's first Prime Minister Milson to Bowtie.

90
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.930
He promoted the hawking young fighter to the position of deputy commander of the

91
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:33.500
army.

92
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.480
He was also putting commands of the first battalion of the Ugandan army in 1965

93
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:42.860
I'm in that his battalion into the Congo to support nationalists and resist the

94
00:05:42.861 --> 00:05:46.700
foreign sport in government that the mission was been successful with the again

95
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:49.790
and forces being repelled by the Congolese mercenaries.

96
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.110
Later that year by men became entangled in a scandal involving the smuggling of

97
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.000
golden livery,

98
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.240
President Frederick and the tastes and the second did his investigation about it

99
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.560
responded by making them in general and chief of staff and tossed him with the

100
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.390
strong handling of the situation.

101
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.370
Even funny of ministers arrested and some named himself as presidents I'm in,

102
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.660
was dispatched with an army false to the place of President Matesa.

103
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.980
I'm in personnel personally.

104
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.770
Five to 12 millimeter gun that was mounted on his jeep to blow holes in the

105
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.290
president's palace walls.
We taste however,

106
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:25.220
he had gone into hiding and managed a fee to England in 1969 [inaudible] was

107
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.370
pleased with the strong man tactics of his right hand man.
Ed.
I'm in.

108
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.760
In 1967 he gave him the come on David the army.

109
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.870
That same year it he enrolled at university and took English classes.

110
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.930
He would eventually receive a doctoral degree from the university.

111
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.100
In 1969 idiom means leadership of the Ugandan army that was challenged.

112
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.700
The aghans in people's Congress were attempting to bring about reforms.

113
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.600
They had major concerns with the tactics that the commander in chief was using

114
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.980
to exert his control.
He had established a pattern of brutalizing his enemies,

115
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.630
fermenting massacres against communities that appeared rebellious and executing

116
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.520
opposition leaders recognizing the shifting winds and began to take courses in

117
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.354
social.
Yeah,

118
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.920
I'm in this brutality.
However,

119
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.000
it could not be quelled when he was accused by brigadier general acquire of

120
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.110
complicity in an assassination attempt on president of biotech.

121
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.510
I'm in arranged for acquire to be assassinated.
Meanwhile,

122
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:28.040
tensions that develops between a boat and then it he had focused on recruiting

123
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:31.370
soldiers from his own tribe in order to build up his personal following.

124
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.850
Then it was proven that he had indeed been behind the attempt on a boat,

125
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:36.380
his life.
At the same time,

126
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:40.550
it was revealed that he had misappropriated 40 million shillings from the

127
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:44.050
military operations fund in 1970 a boat a at.

128
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.630
I'm in fired from his position as commander in chief of the army and instructed

129
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:51.200
as attorneys do prepare a prosecution against him to avoid arrest.

130
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:55.190
I'm in flat to Kampala from that and he waited for his opportunity to strike

131
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:56.180
back at a bowtie.

132
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.500
That opportunity game on January the 25th 1971 on that date,

133
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.770
president about her was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore

134
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.970
with the aid of Rwandan rebels.
He staged a bloody Cooper claiming himself.

135
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:10.620
Both prime minister and the president are those.

136
00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:14.210
Jay heard about this on the flight home from Singapore and diverted his flight

137
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.990
to Tanzania over the last couple of years of Jose's relationship with the

138
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:21.770
western powers had been increasingly turbulence as a result of the change of

139
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.280
government was actually welcomed by Western governments.
Indeed,

140
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.750
Ibotta was also so unpopular as home that the majority of Ugandans celebrated is

141
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:33.700
overthrowing the western powers that high hopes for this new your gums and

142
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:34.400
regime.

143
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.120
They felt that our men would be able to check Russian influence in the region,

144
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.460
what they knew of any amen they liked.

145
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.810
He was a sportsman and national champion box and a man who had failed the army

146
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.410
intelligence exam.
You have gone on to receive a university doctorate.

147
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.590
What they didn't realize was that I'm in was a dictator of unprecedented

148
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.620
ruthlessness.

149
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.750
I'm in.
This rule began with the number of concessions political prisoners were

150
00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:05.141
released.

151
00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:09.100
The secret police was disbanded any promised the people that free and open

152
00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:10.240
elections would be held,

153
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.980
but it didn't take long for his true nature to show itself.

154
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.960
He extended his period of caretaker governance from 18 months to five years.

155
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.100
His reasoning was that he needed a time in order to reform the government in a

156
00:09:24.101 --> 00:09:26.830
way that would truly benefit the nation.
I'm in,

157
00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:30.760
began to award himself and increasingly bizarre succession of titles,

158
00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:34.690
including Lord of all beasts of the earth and fishes of the sea.

159
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.490
In August,
1972 you set his sights on reforming the economy.
In doing so,

160
00:09:39.491 --> 00:09:43.780
he identified a scapegoat for the country's financial worries and that was the

161
00:09:43.781 --> 00:09:46.720
Asians.
His solution was drastic.
All Asians,

162
00:09:46.721 --> 00:09:50.710
even those holding British passports were expelled from Uganda.

163
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.230
He laid to reveal that he had been given the message.

164
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.920
Do you expel the Asians in the vision from God himself?

165
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.270
The 70,000 affected people were given 90 days to leave the country or face

166
00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:04.060
arrest,
imprisonment or worse.

167
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.360
What's more is they could only take what possessions and money they could carry

168
00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:08.050
with them.

169
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.730
All property that's behind would be shad among I'm in his cronies having rid of

170
00:10:12.731 --> 00:10:14.620
the country of the Asian problem.
I'm in,

171
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.580
sent out raising the country of anyone who was associated with the former
regime.

172
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.820
Assassinations became routine and extended to those even just associated with

173
00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:25.330
the old British regime.

174
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.870
Then British businesses and property began to be confiscated by the government.

175
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.540
British Jewish residents were expelled.

176
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.320
Great Britain and Israel responded by cutting off all diplomatic relations with

177
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.000
Uganda.
Those countries also stopped supplying garments to the retreat

178
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.310
I'm in now.
I want to find a new supply of arms.

179
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.580
He found it in Libya in order to achieve that agreements,

180
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.380
I'm in promise that country's own dictator Muammar Gaddafi that he would convert

181
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.460
the nation to Islam.

182
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.750
The Ugandan dictator also turn to Russia for military support is giving them the

183
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:04.830
assurance that he would serve as a stalwart of resistance against the western

184
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:08.940
powers and he also gave his support to the Palestinian struggle against Israel

185
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.990
back home.
I'm in made sweeping changes within the structure of the army.

186
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.430
36 leading officers were told to report to McIntee prison for special training

187
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:19.770
and subversion techniques,
but when they got there,

188
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:24.771
they found themselves being thrown into prison cells or 36 within bayoneted

189
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.080
death.
Former army chief of Staff Brigadier Silliman has seen,

190
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:32.340
was arrested and taken to another place of confinement that the men who were

191
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:35.910
formerly under his command beat him to death with their rifle butts.

192
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.320
That wasn't all that happened to him.

193
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.150
His head was cut off and sent to amen that his new house in Kampala and he had

194
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:45.960
the grizzly trophy placed in the freezer compartment of his refrigerator.

195
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.290
Top army officers are the two main barracks in the country where it's told that

196
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.920
they were to line up on the parade grounds in order to salute an incoming

197
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.140
motorcade of tanks.
On both occasions,
as the tanks came close,

198
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.380
they ran off course and knocks down the startle officers.

199
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.580
Those that weren't crushed to death were shot by waiting rifleman and he has

200
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:04.241
another barracks.

201
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:07.900
The office call were assembled in a room and told them that president was on

202
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:09.670
route to deliver a lecture bus.

203
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.150
As I'm in his entourage and did the barracks grenades were thrown into the room

204
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.120
and all of the officers were killed.
Within a few months,

205
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:20.230
nearly every trained army officer in Uganda had been eliminated.

206
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.380
They were replaced by members of a men's Kakoa tribe.

207
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.270
Men who had been tending goats in the fields became high ranking generals over

208
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:29.180
night.
I mean,

209
00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:32.530
it was largely able to keep the slaughter that was occurring in the army from

210
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.530
the people as well as the international community bus.

211
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.770
When the murderous rampage was extended to the people in general,

212
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.090
the mosque of civility,

213
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.510
it was ripped off in the name of protecting the order of his regime.

214
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.950
More than half a million Ugandans were killed.
No one was immune with a murder.

215
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:51.760
Tall taking and chief justices,
doctors,
lawyers,
diplomats,

216
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.140
teachers and journalists,
foreigners.
We're also mattered now,

217
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.470
just before we get into even more madness and I promise it gets worse,

218
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.740
like feeding heads do crocodiles worse as well.

219
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.860
You probably don't have to worry about that if you do have to deal with the

220
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:10.060
risks,
do your online identity.
Whoa,
Simon,
I hear you cry.
We suddenly in an ads,

221
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:13.120
what happens?
Yup.
Well,
decompression,
sickness aside.

222
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:17.020
Ads are important because they do help us pay for these super long videos,

223
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:20.320
but stick with me.
Like I said,
there's crocodiles being fed,

224
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:24.700
human heads coming up and he wouldn't want to stick around for that.
Am I right?

225
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.870
Also Dash Lane,

226
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.070
it's very cool and it's basically it's free so there's also that dash lane is a

227
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:34.360
one stop digital identity protection tool that includes a VPN for all of your

228
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:38.080
devices so you can use public internet safely and anonymously.

229
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:41.080
They also do something called dark web monitoring,

230
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:45.730
which basically means that they monitor the nasty underbelly of the Internet for

231
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.180
people selling your data and they will alert you if that is happening further.

232
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.200
If a service you've signed up for like Equifax or Sony maybe suffers a breach

233
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.260
dash lane,

234
00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.100
we'll tell you about it right away and they'll also let you do other services

235
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.330
that share that username and password so you can change those before hackers get

236
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:08.830
access to your data on other sites.
Plus Dash Eileen does what he's always done.

237
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.880
It stores your passwords,

238
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:13.930
it keeps your personal data secure and it fills all of those annoying boxes for

239
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:17.500
payment info in passwords for you.
A lot of the dash lane is totally free,

240
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:20.620
but there are some premium upgrades you can buy if you want more from the

241
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:22.810
service to see if those are right for you.

242
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:27.190
You can also get a free 30 day trial of them and after that you can get a 10%

243
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:32.191
discount using our code biographics@dashlane.com forward slash buyer graphics

244
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.480
and let's get in and do those crocodiles and being fed human heads showering.

245
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.060
Unlike many other brutal dictators I'm in,
took a personal hand in the slaughter.

246
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.740
In fact,
he rather seem to revel in it.

247
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.700
He would personally torture people and then feed their heads to crocodiles.

248
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.800
You also proudly spoke about eating the flesh of his enemies and as we've

249
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.170
already seen,
he had a thing for preserving their heads in his fridge.

250
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.130
On one infamous occasion in 90 62 I'm in was hosting a state dinner at his

251
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:10.160
palace and halfway through the meal he left the table.

252
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:13.940
You need to return with the frozen head of Brigadier Silliman Hussein and his

253
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:17.420
hands.
There's a goest guests to know where to look.

254
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.920
As he proceeded to director barrage of abuse at the hands and then through

255
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.820
cutlery at it,
the new and expanded army.
It needed funds and I'm in,

256
00:15:25.821 --> 00:15:30.320
got them by diverting,
much needed tax income away from things like education,

257
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.530
infrastructure and health and put it into the armed forces.

258
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.190
Army courts were given greater prominence than civil courts parliament.

259
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.690
It was dissolved and all ministers are threatened with arrest the ball on an

260
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.050
ratcheted up.
The terror,
the more paranoid he appeared to become,

261
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:50.170
he surrounded himself with a security detail which numbered as many as 18,000

262
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.260
these men doubled as a ruthless death squad.
Murdering,
raping,

263
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:59.261
and pillaging at will on average between 40 and 50 bodies were thrown into Lake

264
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.290
Victoria every single day.
In 1972 ousted president of boat,

265
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:07.970
a based in Tanzania began making plans to retake.

266
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:11.450
Power gathering is false.
He made some incursions across the border.

267
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.470
I'm in retaliated by bombing Tanzania and towns just across the border.

268
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.190
This effectively put an end to a boat as ambitions for power.

269
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.310
While the is chaos was taking place within his borders.

270
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:26.300
I'm in was not shy about acting on the international stage.

271
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.870
He offered to broker peace in Northern Ireland's and courage the Scottish to

272
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:33.290
break away from the Commonwealth and told African countries that they should

273
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.690
unite to oppose South Africa.

274
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.870
He became the chair of the Organization of African Unity.

275
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:43.310
Oau advocating that the consonants completely separate relations with the West

276
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.480
even went as far as to declare that he not Queen Elizabeth was the head of the

277
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:50.630
Commonwealth and accordance with this belief we then awarded himself the

278
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:51.890
Victoria Cross

279
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.140
in establishing links with Russia in Libya.

280
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.940
I'm in offered his support to the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO

281
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.930
when numbers of the PLO hijacked a plane en route from Tel Aviv to Paris in June

282
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:13.931
of 1976 and then invited them to lands the plane at and t they app or with 256

283
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.970
hostages to bargain with veep to PLO.

284
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:22.010
Hijackers demanded the release of 53 PLO prisoners held by the Israelis only on

285
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:27.320
one of the hostages and elderly person by the name of Dora block chokes on some

286
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:30.080
food and was transported to compile a hospital.
I'm in,

287
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.120
threw himself into the drama.
He quickly,

288
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.820
he got himself to the APP autumn's in front of the hostages.

289
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.840
Images of him berating the passengers were shown all around the world.

290
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.790
156 passengers.

291
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:44.080
All of those who did not hold Israeli passports were soon released.

292
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.470
Leaving 100 hostages ironically had the antimony airports had actually been

293
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.330
designed by Israeli engineers back in Tel Aviv.

294
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.050
They were able to pull out the plans for the airports and identify exactly where

295
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:56.460
the hostages were being held.

296
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.110
The Israelis then devised a plan to rescue the hostages and the early morning

297
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.770
hours of July the third a team of Israeli paratroopers has rated the apples in

298
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.000
the ensuing firefight.

299
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.910
Three of the hostages were killed with another 10 being injured.

300
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.350
Seven of the hijackers along with some 45 Ugandan soldiers who fought in support

301
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:15.750
of the hijackers were also killed as it was.

302
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:20.310
One of the rescue is overall though the rescue,
it was a stunning success.
I'm in,

303
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.510
was furious with a ton of events with no one else to vent anger on.

304
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.190
He ordered a couple of his thugs to the compiler hospital.

305
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.840
They bust into the room that door a block was in and as they dragged the older

306
00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:30.660
woman away,

307
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.650
she was never seen again if the world didn't realize that the Ugandan dictator

308
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:36.180
was stark raving mad.

309
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.130
His stated intention to build a memorial to adult Hitler left them with no
doubt.

310
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.190
Following the raid on Entebbe almonds grip on Poway always beginning to weaken.

311
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:50.270
By now the economy was a disaster and attempted k was staged in 1977 that one

312
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:55.350
successful,
it ratcheted up.
I'm in his power levels to an all time high.

313
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.490
All of those suspected in being involved in the plots where executed with entire

314
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:03.900
on the units just being wiped out.
Then in an attempt to galvanize the people,

315
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:07.260
he spread the life that the tens and neons were about to invade.

316
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.520
He mounted a series of preemptive strikes against the supposed invasion.
However,

317
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.040
he refused to pride as support for the ground attacks.

318
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.010
This led to the needless deaths of thousands of his troops.

319
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.330
The Tanzanians pushed the invaders back ans then surged into northern Uganda.

320
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.900
I'm in an intended for the wall with Tanzania to be a distraction from the

321
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:25.740
problems at home,

322
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.610
but the plan it had backfired as the troops surged into the country,

323
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.840
locals joined them and a spontaneous effort to reclaim that country with the

324
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:37.170
ever growing tends in the end and local forces.
Closing an Kampala,
I'm in,

325
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:40.980
made an urgent broadcast urging the army to make a stand standard geneal,

326
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.720
but by now the only two has abandoned him and the call.
It was simply ignored.

327
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.640
Seeing the writing on the wall,

328
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.010
along with his five wives and 35 children fled to Libya where they were given

329
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.150
sanctuary by Muammar Gaddafi.

330
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.370
I'm in left his country with an inflation rate in excess of 200% a national debt

331
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:04.371
of $340 million and the corpses of between 300 and 500,000 of his own people as

332
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:11.250
the people struggled to recover under the reinstated presidency of Milton.

333
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:15.960
A boat day I'm in and his family lived in relative luxury under Gaddafi is large

334
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:17.340
ass.
However,
the two desks,

335
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:21.810
boats had a falling out in 1981 and I'm in left Libya for Saudi Arabia.

336
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.300
Life with the Saudis was a big come down for I'm in and his family they,

337
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.230
they now existed on handouts provided by the Saudi government.

338
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.830
He attempted to come back to Uganda in 1988 with a smaller group of armed

339
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:34.740
followers,
but nothing came of it.
The ends for the Mat.

340
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:39.741
Dictator came on August the 16th 2003 he had fallen into a coma at the month

341
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.480
before with his kidneys failing and no signs of recovery.

342
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.070
His family decided to turn off his life support.
He died with a quiet dignity.

343
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.361
The,

344
00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:51.580
he denied so many of his victims on hearing about the death of his former army

345
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:53.140
chief mills and the Bowtie called,

346
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:57.310
I'm in the greatest brute than African mother has brought to life.

347
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.130
