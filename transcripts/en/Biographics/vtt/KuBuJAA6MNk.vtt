1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.361
Edward.

2
00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:04.470
The first known as long shanks for is uncharacteristic height was a man among

3
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.040
men and the king among kings.
As a child,

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.930
he was so sick of you that few 40 would survive to even take the crown,
take it.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.550
He devs immediately displaying a strength and determination that had been sorely

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.150
lacking.

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
He quickly established as authority with ruthless suppression of rebellion,

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.490
earning him the nickname of a hammer of the Scots and the adoration of all of

9
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:28.350
England.
In this week's biographics,

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.440
we get up close and personal with the man who was Edward Longshanks for King of

11
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.303
England.

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.000
Edward,

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.450
the first future King of England was born at Westminster Palace in London on

14
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:54.410
June the 17th 1239 he was the first born son of King Henry,

15
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.390
the third and Eleanor of Provence.

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.420
Henry was a great admirer of previous King Edward.

17
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:04.040
The confessor runs named his son in his honor.
That one,
it was not a well trials.

18
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:04.341
In fact,

19
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:07.880
he was so weak that the general consensus was that he wouldn't survive into

20
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:11.780
adulthood but survive.
He did growing into an unusually tool lens,

21
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.640
rather robust teenager.

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.180
He would eventually grow to a height of six foot two which allowed him to tower

23
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.530
over most of his contemporaries.

24
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.730
It was his unusual height which would lead soldiers to refer to him as

25
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.860
Longshanks.
During his formative years,

26
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.230
Edward was groomed to take the mantle of king.

27
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380
He was educated by the best scholars and members of the clergy.

28
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.180
He overcame his physical weaknesses to become an Abl wielder of the sword and

29
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:39.980
club as well as a keen students of the arts and languages at the age of 15

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.820
Edward Ends it into an arranged marriage with a 13 year old Elena daughter of

31
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.420
Ferdinand.

32
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.370
The third of Castiel that Mulian was precipitated by the fear of a Castilian

33
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:53.750
invasion of the province of Gascony as part of that marriage contract and would

34
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:57.770
receive land groundswell for 15,000 marks annually in taxation.

35
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
This lands covered much of Ireland and Wales.
However,

36
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.130
the entitlement that the teenage prince had was only in name as the lands were

37
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:10.370
still controlled by his father and the income generated went not to him,

38
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:14.900
but rather do the role lefthand and Simon de Montfort the sixth I'll have lasta.

39
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.580
Vl of Lester was married to the king sister Edward did benefit from the marriage

40
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:21.410
alliance on a more personal level.

41
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.260
Unlike the vast majority of such a range do unions,
he ends.

42
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.040
Elena genuinely cared for each other and that fondness grew into a love that

43
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.110
lasts their entire lives.

44
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.190
King Henry was an extremely pious man whose main focus as king was on building

45
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:44.040
up the authority and symbolism of the church.

46
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.770
He devoted himself to rebuilding Westminster Rabih,

47
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.940
putting his energies into this project at the expense of more pressing concerns

48
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:55.290
of state.
A series of ill advised military forays,
each of which ended in failure,

49
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.040
added fuel to the fire of discontent with his reign.
Among the nobility,

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.360
attempts were made to usurp the king's authority and wrestle power away from
him.

51
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.290
The two most powerful Nobel factions at that time with a silly and Cologne

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.150
families who were opposed to each other.

53
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.470
Henry pushed a policy of neutrality between the camps in 1255 however,

54
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:17.800
the 16 year old Edward began signing with the solar family.

55
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.820
This marketers first active independence from his father.
In the following year,

56
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.900
Edward began associating with what was called the Lucy norm faction made up of

57
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.720
the half brother was of his father who were a French origin.

58
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.010
This group was largely despised by the nobility and had a reputation for being

59
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:34.780
rather uncouth and violence.

60
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.010
Concerns were expressed in the royal court over the increasing wildness of

61
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.690
Edwards conduct when he was with the Lucy minions.
Three years later,

62
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.600
a body of nobles drew up a documents known as the provisions of Oxford,

63
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.800
which spelled out a series of reforms designed to give the barons much more say

64
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:52.360
in the running of the king's governments.

65
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.200
The barons were especially opposed to the influence of the loosen yours

66
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.480
relations between Henry and his brother in law,

67
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.420
Simon demand fought HUD then strains from the very start.

68
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.210
Simon had not sought the king's permission for marriage,

69
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.470
do his sister Simon then proceeded to amass large debts naming the king as a

70
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:09.550
guarantor that again,

71
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:12.340
without his permission as long than it was at the forefront of the barons

72
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.810
efforts.
Do you bring reformance?

73
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.200
The pressure imposed eventually led to the king signing the provisions.

74
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.220
He was now obligated to seek the counsel of his barons on matters relating to

75
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.940
the governing of the kingdom as the pressure at the ends of mountain.
His father,

76
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.800
Edward remains loyal to his friends,

77
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:30.190
the loose in your arms and took a stance in opposition to the provisions of

78
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.930
Oxford.
But as the reform movement grew in intensity,
his position,
it's shifted.

79
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.580
On October,

80
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.790
1259 he announced that he was supportive of the goals of the barons and aligns

81
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:41.260
himself with his father's rival.

82
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.760
Simon demand fought in November at 1259 king Henry embarked on a voyage to

83
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.210
France and his absence,
Edwards opposition to his father.
The group.

84
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
He appointed several of the rebellious barons to important positions within the

85
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.170
royal court.
When news of this reaches farther in Normandy,

86
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.050
he was convinced that Edward was about to stage Nova throat.

87
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.960
He quickly returned to London,
do reimpose his position.

88
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.140
At first the outraged Henry refused to even see Edward,

89
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:09.550
but finally the sort of piece was broken between them by the Archbishop of

90
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.100
Canterbury.
It was decided that Edward was to go abroad,

91
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.640
which he did at the age of 21 in November,

92
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.460
1260 he ended up in France where he fell in love with his old pals.

93
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.340
Then Newson yawns.

94
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.291
Meanwhile,

95
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:30.010
in 1261 king Henry with the backing of the pope in Rome over through the

96
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.820
provisions of Oxford this at the Barron's do set up their own independent

97
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.120
parliaments with civil war looming.
This Nobel parliament,

98
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.260
it was dissolved and the noble rebellious barons.
They flat demoed fort himself,

99
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.981
all left the country,

100
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.650
but he returned two years later when the heat had died down to fit,

101
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.990
managed to raise a sizable army and marched on London the king vacillation and

102
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.940
seemed ready to give up his throne.

103
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.970
It was at this point that Edward stepped up and began to take control of the

104
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:55.804
situation.

105
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.200
Any hesitancy he had shown in supporting his father's rule had vanished and he

106
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.890
was now storage need determined to restore the king's dominance.

107
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.490
He took control of the king's army and that in defense if the realm,

108
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.830
the rentals were ousted from Windsor Castle,

109
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.980
a compromise of sorts was reached thanks to the intervention of King Louie.

110
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.830
The ninth of France even negotiated the agreement known as the me's of Mer.

111
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.280
The vase between the king and the barons was short lived in 1264 hostilities

112
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.870
broke out one small with the onset of what history recalls as the second Baron's

113
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.920
walk.
Once again,

114
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.700
the barons were led by Simon demand fought while the forces loyal to the king

115
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.570
were bubs with the control of the now 24 year old Prince Edward in the wake of a

116
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.920
series of smaller victories,

117
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:39.200
Edwards on the mess up with the forces of demand for that.

118
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:44.201
At the battle of Loos on May the 14th 1264 things went well for the royalist

119
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:47.600
forces as they managed to force the London contingents of the opposition into

120
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:48.290
retreat.

121
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.190
But then Edward made the mistake of breaking off with a portion of his army to

122
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:54.270
chase down the London is when he returns.

123
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.930
The main scene of the mantle is forces had been defeated.

124
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.520
Edward was taken as a prisoner and held until the following may when he managed

125
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:03.080
to escape.
Over the next few months,

126
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:06.110
the royalist forces steadily wore down the resistance army.

127
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.140
The most telling victory was that the battle of [inaudible] on August the fourth

128
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:11.120
1265 the Barron's army,

129
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.250
it was ravaged with many of its need is being put to the sword.

130
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.110
Simon de Montfort was himself kills when alliance was run through his body.

131
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.690
Edward then allowed US soldiers do mutilate the body,

132
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:23.350
including cutting off the testicles and hanging them over.

133
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:27.410
Demonic Montfort's knows such actions were strictly against the protocol of war,

134
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:30.080
which stipulated that nobles were to be treated humanely.

135
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.250
However they'd would consider demonic fit to be a traitor and therefore beyond

136
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:38.240
the rules of conduct.
The last of the rebels made a standard Kenilworth Castle.

137
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.380
Finally surrendering in accordance with the terms of the dictum of Kenilworth,

138
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.130
Edwards decisive actions and leadership skills during the barons rebellion,

139
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.370
Sjogren's and be a man of action.
Who possessed the courage,
ability,

140
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.680
and personality to be a great king?
Yes.

141
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.850
With the rebellion crushed and his father's rulership a should he put his focus

142
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.620
on an upcoming crusade.

143
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.311
King Louie,

144
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:07.850
the ninth of France was planning a crusade to North Africa in order to defeat

145
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:12.851
the Muslims and 1268 Edward lefting islands with a force of around 1,200 men

146
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.890
along with him was his wife Elena.

147
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.180
After crossing the channel and then the Mediterranean,

148
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:20.600
they arrived at North Sirica and you need to discover the French king was dead.

149
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.060
The result of a fatal bout of dysentery,

150
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.570
Edward was now the leader of the allied force and deep chose to withdraw the

151
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:27.950
fleet to Sicily.
However,

152
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:31.730
on routes a severe storm decimated the fleas and the French contingent decided

153
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:34.460
to return home rather than following the French example,

154
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:36.080
then would decided to forge ahead.

155
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.250
He landed at Acra on May the ninth of 1271 the and Anbar in the hardy land was

156
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:44.360
under serious threat from the Muslim states with jewelry and them already having

157
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:48.800
fallen in 1244 the Egyptian Mamluks well now threatening to take acro,

158
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:52.280
which I've just the Christian capital with a relatively small false of Matt.

159
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.920
There was this little Edward could do to stem the tide Muslim aggression.

160
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.910
The Mandolin Warrior King by bars had tens of thousands of men under his command

161
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.350
before departing for home.
However,

162
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.950
that would play a part in the negotiation of a truce with babe ours.

163
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.630
Once the treaty was signed,

164
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.900
he stayed for a period of time to ensure that its conditions would be carried

165
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:10.380
out.

166
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.870
One night in September of 1272 and assassin into the bed chamber of Edward and

167
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.210
Elinor in order to attempt to thrust a poisonous dagger into the prince is on

168
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.480
and was able to fend off the attack and kill the assassin.

169
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.990
Legend has it that I dunno,

170
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.250
sucks the poison from our husband Zam thus saving his life

171
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.470
in the wake of the foils.
Assassination plot,
the role coupled,

172
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.780
they left the holy lands.
Upon saving to Sicily,

173
00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:40.960
Edward was given the news that his father,
the king had died.

174
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.070
Edward had been weakened to bind the poison attack and so now as King of

175
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:45.080
England's,

176
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.450
he and Elena is queen took allegedly trip home the situation back in England.

177
00:09:49.451 --> 00:09:52.450
It was pretty stable,
so he didn't really see a need to rush back.

178
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.080
Edward made his way home through bitterly ans then onto France crossing the

179
00:09:56.081 --> 00:10:00.520
channel.
In early August of 1274 Edward was officially crowned King Edward.

180
00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:05.020
The first on August the 19th 1274 at Westminster Abbey when the crown was placed

181
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:05.501
upon his head,

182
00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:09.310
a chronic alert reported that Edward immediately took it off again and stated

183
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.790
that he would only wear it again when all of the territory that was lost during

184
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:17.260
the kingship of his father was returned.
The new king,
which 35 years old,

185
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:20.020
he was tall,
muscular,
and his militarily adept.

186
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.160
He was the man of action that his father had simply not.
Then.
You see,

187
00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:28.160
he enjoyed the roughest and most dangerous forms of hunting such as going after

188
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.930
bores and wolves.
As a younger man,
he was prone to flying off the handle,

189
00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:35.500
but age had restrained as temper.
By the time he ascended to the throne,

190
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.700
he had built a reputation as a loyal friends and they devoted ruler.
However,

191
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.270
he was also known as a hard man who could be harsh,
even cruel,

192
00:10:43.271 --> 00:10:46.120
and the furtherance of his own will Edwards rain.

193
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.050
It was not going to be a continuation of his father's weekend Leoneans rule.

194
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.320
He immediately set about reestablishing the dominance of the crown.

195
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.950
His other power was unquestioned,
but he sold it.
In order to retain power,

196
00:10:56.951 --> 00:10:59.800
he had to institute policies that were popular with the people.

197
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.890
Does that mean you prevent a repeat of the civil war that had scarred his

198
00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:03.671
father's reign?

199
00:11:03.671 --> 00:11:07.710
He made lasting provision for the lower classes to be represented in
parliaments.

200
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.330
This established the basis of the House of Commons,

201
00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:14.320
which today is the predominant house in the English political system.

202
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.370
During the first years of his reign would focus primarily on streamlining and is

203
00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:26.320
reforming the administration of its governments.

204
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.590
He then turned his attention to the situation that was a caring and Wales,

205
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.400
the Prince of Wales Lewin and APP Griff am had been handed the title buying King

206
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.370
Henry the third in return for agreeing to pay homage to the English Crown

207
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.220
Lewellen.
However,
it had been an ally of Henry and Edwards Enemies,

208
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:44.140
Simon Demand Fort and set about conquering of the Welsh Kingdoms and was now

209
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:46.210
threatening to move against England itself.

210
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.350
That would acted preemptively needing a force of 10,000 across the Welsh border.

211
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.960
However,

212
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.730
the unpopularity at home prevented him raising a sizable on each counter.

213
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.420
The English invasion.
In fact,
as Izombie Zombie moved up,
the Welsh countryside,

214
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.290
Edwards forces were strengthened by the addition of local Welsh armies who were

215
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.520
opposed to a woman.

216
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.670
Among those who joined Edward was Lewellen's own brother to feed.

217
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.310
The upstart was soon deposed and Edward claims,

218
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.250
large swaths of Welsh territory is his own.

219
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.060
He rewarded a fed by giving him a small parcel of land that was not pleasing to

220
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:19.180
him and he felt that he deserved much more for his service to the crown.

221
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.770
In 1282 to it led a revolt against the king that was soon joined by his ceiling.

222
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.670
Brother Llewellyn and angry Edward responded by invading wells the second time.

223
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.600
This time,
however,

224
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:32.260
he was determined to go all out with eight three pronged attack from the south

225
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.530
east and the north.
The English invasion was unstoppable,

226
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:39.190
resulting in the stomping out of the rebellion and the death in battle of

227
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.490
Llewellyn for his parts.
His affairs was captured and executed.

228
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.690
Edward consolidated as a Victorian wells by constructing a series of castle's

229
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.360
throughout the lands.
The most impressive was that canal oven.

230
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.710
It was here that Edward's son and future and with the second was born in 1284

231
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.970
the now vacant size love Prince of Wales was bestowed upon the child since.

232
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.911
Since that time,

233
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:01.210
the dash to the British throne has been given that title in a ceremony that is

234
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:04.240
held it can have on console when it came to foreign relations.

235
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.420
Edward did his best to maintain peaceful relations with this European

236
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:11.140
counterparts despite the fact that Phillip,
the third of France was his cousin.

237
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:14.410
Relations between the two powers were under constant tension.

238
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.490
When Philip died in 1285 Edward Cross the channel in order to pay homage to the

239
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.620
new French King Phillip the fourth.

240
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.260
He did not return to England until 1289 spending much time in the dump.

241
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:25.110
She of Gasconade,

242
00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:28.990
which was one of his possessions and 1287 it would took the cross for the second

243
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:32.710
time intending it to stage another far more successful crusade to retake the

244
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:34.030
holy lands from the Muslims.

245
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.960
He knew that success in this enterprise depended on the stitching together of a

246
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:41.140
truly international European alliance.
Towards that end.

247
00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:44.800
He expended much ethics trying to present a piece among the powers,

248
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.910
Edwards long absence from buns and had thrown the government into confusion and

249
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.540
chaos.

250
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.830
He returned to discover the corruption was rife and was forced in discussed to

251
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:55.900
expel many of his judges and ministers.

252
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.610
On November the 28th 1290 Eleanor died after suffering a protracted illness that

253
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:03.490
may have been malaria.
She was just 48 years of age,

254
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:06.130
having spent 35 of them at Edwards side.

255
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.440
The king was distraught at the loss of his wife.

256
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.960
He became a hardened man in the wake of her loss,

257
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:13.030
more bitter and rooting in nature.

258
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.910
Edwards campaign against the well should impose huge financial burdens upon this

259
00:14:22.911 --> 00:14:23.330
nation.

260
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.050
Taxes with a main way to meet those expenses into prime source of that taxation

261
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:30.740
where the Jews of England's Edward Tax the Jews far more heavily than any other

262
00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:31.190
group.

263
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.820
In 1279 he ordered the arrest of all the heads of Jewish households throughout

264
00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:38.390
the country.
About 300 of them were put to death the following year.

265
00:14:38.391 --> 00:14:42.260
All Jews were ordered to attend special sermons,
preached by Dominican fries.

266
00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:44.120
In order to convert them to Christianity.

267
00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:49.280
Then in 1290 Edward issued the edict of expulsion by which old Jews were kicked

268
00:14:49.281 --> 00:14:50.060
out of England.

269
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.230
It wasn't until 16 six that the Jewish band in England was finally lifted

270
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.630
from 1290 onward.

271
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:04.930
Edwards attention was focused on troubles in Scotland following the death of

272
00:15:04.931 --> 00:15:08.470
Alexander the third and 1286 Scotland's whether it's governed in the name of his

273
00:15:08.471 --> 00:15:09.220
granddaughter,

274
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.940
Margaret King Edward had made the suggestion that his eldest surviving son

275
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:15.820
Edward of kind of on Margaret should be United in marriage,

276
00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:18.190
bringing about the union of England and Scotland.

277
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.290
Before this could happen though Margaret died,

278
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.800
the Scottish throne was now in dispute with a number of claimants and the

279
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:27.490
English king was asked to play the role of arbitrator and Edwin agreed,

280
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.790
but on the condition that the claimant's accept him as their overlord.

281
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:35.290
In 1292 he awarded the throne to John Balliol who was crowned as the new king.

282
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.700
It didn't take long,
however,

283
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:40.270
the Scottish people to resent the jurisdiction or control this Edward held over

284
00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:40.900
their country.

285
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.800
John was deprived of all this power and the Scots formed an alliance with
France.

286
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.190
By this time,
England's relations with the French had deteriorated.

287
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.340
Things that come to a head when Phillip the fourth refuse to restore the Duchy

288
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:52.690
of Gascony to Edgewood.

289
00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:57.670
In 1293 Edward declared war on France at the very time that the Scots had United

290
00:15:57.671 --> 00:16:00.190
with Scotland to make a bad situation worse,

291
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:03.010
the Welsh choose this time to rise in rebellion.

292
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.510
King John had Scotland gathered his forces in March of 1296 Edward Mustard,

293
00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:11.230
his forces and again marched into battle many Scottish Nobels,
including Robert,

294
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:15.400
the Bruce sided with Edward,
who's first target city was the city of Bowick.

295
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.510
It turns into a brutal massacre of the Scots with many people being killed.

296
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.470
The next target was the costly Dunbar.
Despite having the higher grounds,

297
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:28.170
the Scottish defenders were routed on April the 27th at 1296 the Scottish army

298
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.770
was virtually wiped out,

299
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.230
allowing Edward to quickly take a succession of castles.

300
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.770
All the remains was for King John to surrender.

301
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.400
On July the second John Center pleading letter to Edward Begging forgiveness and

302
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:40.960
Massey.
Edward accepted,

303
00:16:40.961 --> 00:16:45.130
but only off to subjugating John to a series of humiliations including having

304
00:16:45.131 --> 00:16:47.650
the Scottish coat of arms torn from his socket.

305
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.750
He was then thrown into the tower of London,

306
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.950
but that God wasn't finished with Scotland's.

307
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.630
He was determined to stamp out any vestiges of Scottish independence and to

308
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:57.700
absorb it's people into the English kingdom.

309
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:02.110
He demanded Osa fealty from all Scottish nobles and magnets and either refuse to

310
00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:04.450
do so.
We're hunted down as outlaws

311
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.240
after conquering the Scots,
Edward returned south.

312
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.960
He now has a focus on issues with the French.
However,
the masters in Scotland,

313
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:20.350
we're not ready to subject themselves to the heel of Edward Longshanks

314
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.060
resistance.
Grew under three divergent leaders in the southwest,

315
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.520
Robert the Bruce and merged as the head of a gathering of nobles and church

316
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:28.930
leaders in the northeast.

317
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:33.100
The struggle was spearheaded by Andrew Murray and in the center of the country

318
00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:35.270
forces were being gathered by an obscure,

319
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.630
a member of a noble family named William Wallace.

320
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.920
In 1297 Wallace mad the English Sheriff of Line Arc William to hassle rig this

321
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:46.660
act,
United,
the disjointed pockets of resistance into a full blown rebellion.

322
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.740
Two months later with a situation reaching a point,

323
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.550
Edward was forced to send his left tenants in to deal with the situation.

324
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.880
Meanwhile,
he had his own battle to fight in Flanders in France,

325
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.260
even though he didn't want his conquest of Scotland to run Ravelry.

326
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.230
You also knew that abandoning planned French invasion would only strengthen the

327
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:06.000
rebels hand as things stand down.

328
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.760
The British underestimated the strength of the Scottish resistance.

329
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.930
What appeared to be a Scottish attempt is and negotiated surrender was in fact
a,

330
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.460
was to allow Wallace more time together as army with his army strengthens.

331
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.920
Wallace managed to push the English from five path share and done deep.

332
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.530
The climactic battle occurred at Stirling bridge.

333
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.750
The English out numbered the sculpts six to one,

334
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:28.260
but when the leader of the first vanguard here to crossing him was reputedly

335
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.680
struck down by Wallace himself thousands following turn flat.

336
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.520
While this went on to exploit the terrain and generally outmaneuver the British

337
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:37.290
to win a resounding victory.

338
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.130
Wallace quickly that is ever growing forces to overthrow the remaining English

339
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:45.000
outposts in Scotland.
He then crossed the border and invaded English territory.

340
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.260
After taking Northumberland,
he reached as far south as cocky mouth.
With this,

341
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.440
it was time for Edward to take control of the situation.
Personally.

342
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.580
In 1298 king's Zombie gathered out Roxborough with the king joining them.

343
00:18:56.581 --> 00:19:00.570
In early July,
he marched north with 17,000 men.
By now,

344
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:01.770
Wallace had returned to sculpins.

345
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.730
Edward was determined to hunt him down though while it's high then it was not

346
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:09.060
keen to engage the king and drew the Monica feather north.
This Scott said,

347
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.150
strip the lands and leaving the English with no food and just stretch it out.

348
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.430
Supply line with his army disintegrating.

349
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:18.180
Edward had a stroke of luck when intelligence was received that Wallison his men

350
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.030
wept stationed at fall.
Kirk about 20 miles away,

351
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.480
beginning immediately such as Ami and the direction of foul cock.
The Scots,

352
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:28.190
they were surprised that they were in a strongly entrenched position.
In the end,

353
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.950
the the strength of the English infantry and cavalry assaults was too much for

354
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:35.700
the Scottish army and they were torn to pieces while it's managed to escape and

355
00:19:35.701 --> 00:19:39.060
led pockets of resistance for the next seven years,
but the English,

356
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.400
they were able to reestablish dominance over Scotland's.

357
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.970
In 30 no five William Wallace was finally captured by the English.

358
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.480
They was taken to London where he was hung,
drawn and quartered.

359
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.320
However,
this wasn't the end of the Scottish problem for Edwin.

360
00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.710
In 1306 Robert the Bruce assassinated rival for the throne,

361
00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:05.300
which had been vacant for 10 years.
He then had himself crowned King of Scotland.

362
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.450
He was quickly defeated in battle with the English after which he went into

363
00:20:08.451 --> 00:20:12.410
hiding or need to return in 30 no seven to conduct,
hit and run raids on English,

364
00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:13.730
fortresses,
Edwards,

365
00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:17.000
and now in failing health was still the time and to bring up this latest

366
00:20:17.001 --> 00:20:18.680
Scottish rental to heal,

367
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.190
he again gathered is Ami and headed north on the journey.
Does Scotland.
However,

368
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.600
the king contracted dysentery on the morning of July the seventh 1307 he died

369
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.850
just a few miles short of the Scottish border.

370
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.360
It is said that he left instructions with his son for the flesh to be boiled

371
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:35.330
from his body and his bones to be preserved.

372
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.850
Then every time the Scots should rebel against him,

373
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.900
his son would carry with him the bones of his father instead of his body was

374
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:44.000
taken back to lungs and where it was placed in a plane.

375
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.460
Tomb in Westminster Abbey,
700 years later,

376
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.070
that to Ms Dolan display reminding visitors of the strength and authority of one
