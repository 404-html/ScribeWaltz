<v Speaker 1>It is no secret that Amazon Dotcom is dominating multiple aspects of our daily</v>

2
00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:05.560
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>We can find just about everything we could possibly need on their site,</v>

4
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you've got Amazon Prime Yoni,</v>

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>wait two days for free delivery for our digital media.</v>

6
00:00:15.761 --> 00:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>We can read books on kindle,</v>

7
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>listen to music on Alexa,</v>

8
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>and we can also watch on demand movies and TV series.</v>

9
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.280
<v Speaker 1>This all started with an idea that exploded into a digital revolution.</v>

10
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>So who is the man behind the trillion dollar company?</v>

11
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>on today's episode of Biographics we're talking about Jeff Bezos.</v>

13
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>On January the twelfth,</v>

15
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:49.061
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

16
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:54.061
<v Speaker 1>64 or 17 year old girl named Jacqueline gave birth to a baby boy named Jeffrey</v>

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.031
<v Speaker 1>Preston,</v>

18
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>your cousin in Albuquerque,</v>

19
00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico.</v>

20
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>She was married to Jevs biological father,</v>

21
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Ted August,</v>

22
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and for just a one year while she was finishing earning a high school diploma,</v>

23
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>but their relationship,</v>

24
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>it was not meant to last and they got a divorce.</v>

25
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Jacqueline later remarried,</v>

26
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 1>a man named Mike Bezos,</v>

27
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>who was a Cuban immigrants who are to college scholarship in the US.</v>

28
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>They have two children together and they also gave jeff the last name.</v>

29
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:19.384
<v Speaker 1>Bezos.</v>

30
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Jeff grew up in a very loving and supportive family.</v>

31
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.721
<v Speaker 1>His step father,</v>

32
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:23.051
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

33
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>was very resourceful and hard working.</v>

34
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>His motto was very loving and supportive,</v>

35
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>and she was especially concerned about making sure that our son got the best</v>

36
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>education possible.</v>

37
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.420
<v Speaker 1>She bought jeff into a Montessori school.</v>

38
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind this educational method is to allow a child to excel in their</v>

39
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>natural talents so they choose what they want to learn at their own pace instead</v>

40
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>of forcing every child to learn the same things at the same time,</v>

41
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Jeff was extremely focused on his schoolwork,</v>

42
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>even from a young age.</v>

43
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>After the allotted time in each subject was up,</v>

44
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>his teachers had a hard time getting him to move on to the next topic in</v>

45
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:56.621
<v Speaker 1>preschool.</v>

46
00:01:56.621 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>They had to pick him up while still sitting in his chair and move him just to</v>

47
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>break his concentration.</v>

48
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos spent his summer vacations living with his grandparents and helping</v>

49
00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>them run their ranch in Texas.</v>

50
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>His grandparents own didn't ask dream trailer,</v>

51
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>so they would go on long road trip vacations together as well.</v>

52
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>During these trips,</v>

53
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>he would find excuses to do math problems on a scrap of paper like their average</v>

54
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>gas mileage and how much they were spending on groceries even though he helped</v>

55
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:23.080
<v Speaker 1>around the ranch with the chores.</v>

56
00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>He did not particularly enjoy the outdoors and do you prefer to watch TV and</v>

57
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>read books.</v>

58
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 1>At a very early age,</v>

59
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos was showing signs that he was a genius.</v>

60
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>His grandfather was also a very intelligent man and he could see the potential</v>

61
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>in Jeff's future,</v>

62
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>so his grandfather gave him some very valuable advice which stuck with him for</v>

63
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the rest of his life.</v>

64
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>I explained it's harder to be kind than clever.</v>

65
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Cleverness is a gift.</v>

66
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Kindness is a choice and choices can be hot.</v>

67
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful.</v>

68
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>He spent the rest of his life reminding himself that no matter how much he</v>

69
00:02:58.361 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>accomplished,</v>

70
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>he would try to stay down to us.</v>

71
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I tell him his mother allows him to have a workshop in their garage where he</v>

72
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>built a solar cooker.</v>

73
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Huffaker often even installed a security alarm on his bedroom door.</v>

74
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>He was competing in science fans,</v>

75
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>reading science fiction,</v>

76
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and watching episodes of star trek on TV when he was 10 years old,</v>

77
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>he found a teletype computer at his school.</v>

78
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He and his friends found out that there was a star trek game preprogrammed into</v>

79
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

80
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Gold track 73,</v>

81
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>so he and his friends used the computer to play this game.</v>

82
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>This sparked his interest in computer programming and it would carry on for the</v>

83
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>rest of his life.</v>

84
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.471
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bays,</v>

85
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>they started his first business in high school.</v>

86
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>He was disappointed by the quality of its towns,</v>

87
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>local summer camp,</v>

88
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>where kids would just play games outside most of the day and not really learning</v>

89
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

90
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>So he founded a new camp called the dream institute.</v>

91
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>They announced kids from the fourth,</v>

92
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.771
<v Speaker 1>fifth,</v>

93
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>and sixth grade to attends and focused on teaching children about important</v>

94
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>works of literature in a fun,</v>

95
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.543
<v Speaker 1>exciting way.</v>

96
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.091
<v Speaker 1>The business,</v>

97
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>it was a success and many of these kids who are doing that summer reading,</v>

98
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>we'd go on to get better grades in school,</v>

99
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>not surprisingly,</v>

100
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>he was the Valedictorian of his high school class,</v>

101
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>and during his graduation speech he said that he believed that a one day human</v>

102
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>beings would colonize space after graduation.</v>

103
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>He attended Princeton University and earned a degree in computer science.</v>

104
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>His first job was at a startup called fit out.</v>

105
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.731
<v Speaker 1>While he worked there,</v>

106
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>he was expected to fly between New York and London nearly every week in order to</v>

107
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>get his job done,</v>

108
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>which was costing the company a tremendous amount of money he ran is that this</v>

109
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>was not the most efficient way to run a business,</v>

110
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>and it got into thinking about all the different things that he would do more</v>

111
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>efficiently if he got to run his own company in the future.</v>

112
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>His next job was at bankers trust,</v>

113
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>which gave him some experience in the financial industry.</v>

114
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.091
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

115
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>he works for an investment firm on Wall Street called De Shaw.</v>

116
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>He helps to develop software for trading stocks online.</v>

117
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>As the years went on,</v>

118
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos was staying on top of the news about the growth of the Internet.</v>

119
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He realized that every single year the number of people who are using the</v>

120
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Internet was increasing by 2000,</v>

121
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>300 percent.</v>

122
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Even though the world wide web had many naysayers,</v>

123
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>he knew that the Internet wasn't just a passing fad and it would become a part</v>

124
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>of people's daily lives.</v>

125
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Very soon he knew early on to take advantage of this and figured that if he</v>

126
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>couldn't genuinely create an online business that would help make people's lives</v>

127
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>easier,</v>

128
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>it would last.</v>

129
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>It was also was thinking about the customer and then work from that.</v>

130
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Before Jeff Bezos met his wife,</v>

131
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:35.921
<v Speaker 1>Mckenzie,</v>

132
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>he said that he was always looking for a resource for women because he always</v>

133
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:42.600
<v Speaker 1>admired how his own parents would work as a team in order to make their</v>

134
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>circumstances work.</v>

135
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It needs a drug that he was looking for someone to sort of like macgyver,</v>

136
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 1>someone who was able to get him out of a third world prison.</v>

137
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>He was lucky to find out while he was still working his job at de Shaw Mckenzie</v>

138
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Tuttle was a fellow princeton who was applying to work for the fan since Jeff</v>

139
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Bezos was the one in charge of hiring new candidates.</v>

140
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>He sold her resume and even before meeting her,</v>

141
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>he knew that she was clearly a very intelligent and capable women.</v>

142
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>When she arrived for the job interview,</v>

143
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you felt cupid's Arrow strike him right in the heart.</v>

144
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Even the office romances are sometimes frowned upon.</v>

145
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>They fell in love now,</v>

146
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>even though he secretly at Mater,</v>

147
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to cross the line,</v>

148
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>so it was actually Mckinsey who made the first move and asked him out for lunch.</v>

149
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>They were dating for just three months before they got engaged and they got</v>

150
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>married in 1993.</v>

151
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>When Jeff Bezos turned 30 years old,</v>

152
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>they had been married for only a year.</v>

153
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>He told his wife about his idea for an online bookstore and that he wanted to</v>

154
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>quit his job in order to pursue it.</v>

155
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>They decided to leave New York City in 1994.</v>

156
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.371
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

157
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I just chose to start this company in Seattle because it's also the location of</v>

158
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:47.571
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft,</v>

159
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>so there was a lot of talent in the tech industry,</v>

160
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.721
<v Speaker 1>living death,</v>

161
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and to find employees from.</v>

162
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's also far cheaper to start a company that compared to New York or silicon</v>

163
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>valley,</v>

164
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>they now have several children together and they had built a rock solid</v>

165
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>foundation together long before Amazon Dotcom never existed.</v>

166
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Once the company began to do well,</v>

167
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Mackenzie was able to fulfill her dream of becoming a published author.</v>

168
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.081
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

169
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:09.914
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos,</v>

170
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>he puts family first.</v>

171
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>He says that he refuses to take any meetings before 10:00 AM because spending</v>

172
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>time with his family and having breakfast with his children before they go to</v>

173
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>school is more important to him than anything else.</v>

174
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>When Jeff Thins Mckenzie Bayzos first moved down to the west coast to start</v>

175
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.com in 1994.</v>

176
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.430
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>

177
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the website only soldier used books in his mind is Jeff Bezos imagined a</v>

178
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>bookstore with millions of titles and he knew that that would eventually be the</v>

179
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>end goal of the company because the did the accounting and he began building the</v>

180
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 1>website and sourcing inventory.</v>

181
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.491
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

182
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:51.800
<v Speaker 1>they ran the company out of that garage.</v>

183
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>After receiving an order for a book,</v>

184
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Jeff would go to thrift stores and used the bookshops that looking for the book</v>

185
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>that was requested and then send it to the customer through the mail.</v>

186
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>If he could not find it,</v>

187
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 1>he would source it from someone else online just to make sure that the sale went</v>

188
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

189
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>That way they were able to run the company without using much physical space</v>

190
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>when they were ready to hire a team to help them run the business out of that</v>

191
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

192
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the staff of Amazon.com,</v>

193
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>it was only eight people.</v>

194
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Since the company did not have much money,</v>

195
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>he asked his employees to make desks out of old doors.</v>

196
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Even to this day,</v>

197
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:23.740
<v Speaker 1>the door desk is still a tradition at MSN offices.</v>

198
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Before bringing the website live onto the world wide web based,</v>

199
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they sent it to 300 of his friends so that they could test it beforehand.</v>

200
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>When the team was getting ready to officially launch the site in 1995,</v>

201
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>they set up the computer to Ding every time that there was a sale.</v>

202
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

203
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone would shout and share every time there was a new sale,</v>

204
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but within just a few days there were so many sales that they grew tired of the</v>

205
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>noise and they had to turn it off.</v>

206
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>The website was so popular they were getting business through word of mouth</v>

207
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>without paying a single dime for press coverage.</v>

208
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.213
<v Speaker 1>Jeff's idea,</v>

209
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely shocking and it was clear to the team that the company would</v>

210
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>become a success.</v>

211
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>The reason why Amazon.com succeeded so quickly was that Bayzos was filling a</v>

212
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>very real need that people had.</v>

213
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>It was the very first online bookstore before even barnes and noble began</v>

214
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>selling their stock on the Internet.</v>

215
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.471
<v Speaker 1>Ever since then,</v>

216
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Amazon continued to pioneer various aspects of incorporating the internet into</v>

217
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>people's daily lives and he says that for seven years there was no competition</v>

218
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that was similar to what he was doing in 1997 bays.</v>

219
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to take Amazon.com public.</v>

220
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Thankfully he still had connections on Wall Street,</v>

221
00:09:30.511 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>so we knew exactly how to approach investors with a business plan.</v>

222
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 1>They fully admitted that he did not actually intend to make any profit for the</v>

223
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>first five years that the company was operating,</v>

224
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos gave stock options to all of his original employees,</v>

225
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>and this made them very motivated to make the company succeed.</v>

226
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>After a couple of years,</v>

227
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 1>every single one of those eight employees had become multimillionaires.</v>

228
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 1>After awhile,</v>

229
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>bases wanted to sell for more than just books,</v>

230
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>female to thousand random customers asking what sorts of items they would like</v>

231
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>to buy on the Internet.</v>

232
00:09:59.250 --> 00:09:59.791
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

233
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 1>he was getting replies.</v>

234
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>If ice comes in just about every category,</v>

235
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>he realized that he wanted to grow Amazon into a store that sold everything and</v>

236
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 1>he began using the same method that he had with books,</v>

237
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>listing a product online,</v>

238
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>buying the item in person,</v>

239
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 1>and then shipping it to the customer.</v>

240
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:15.961
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

241
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 1>this only helped the company grow even more,</v>

242
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>but even after earning millions of dollars,</v>

243
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Bayzos continued to drive his beat up old Honda.</v>

244
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.390
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to show his employees that he still stood by his core values of</v>

245
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 1>frugality and resourcefulness.</v>

246
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Instead of spending that money on himself,</v>

247
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 1>he reinvested the money to make Amazon.com better.</v>

248
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 1>They bought out other competing online book region is and brought them into the</v>

249
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>fold.</v>

250
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>He also designed it to give anyone in the United States the opportunity to sell</v>

251
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>on the Amazon platform as third party sellers,</v>

252
00:10:45.451 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>which one made the platform stronger because it expanded their adventury.</v>

253
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Every decision Jeff Bezos made for the expanding business was with the future in</v>

254
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

255
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 1>When he learned about Ebooks,</v>

256
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>he gave the people the opportunity to self publish their work online for the</v>

257
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 1>first time and Zen and income.</v>

258
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.191
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

259
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 1>he develops the kindle ereader to give people a place to read all of their</v>

260
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:06.430
<v Speaker 1>ebooks.</v>

261
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 1>When you saw on digital streaming services becoming popular,</v>

262
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 1>he jumped on that bandwagon as well and the list of things like this,</v>

263
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it just goes on and on.</v>

264
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.791
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

265
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.com is one of the most massive corporations in the world and they have</v>

266
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>dipped their toes into so many different industries at this point that it's kind</v>

267
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>of hard to keep track.</v>

268
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Amazon has been criticized for putting independent bookstores out of business.</v>

269
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Even major corporations like borders books simply could not compete.</v>

270
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>According to Amazon Dot Com.</v>

271
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Former manager Mike Daisy.</v>

272
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Amazon is designed from the ground up to be a shock.</v>

273
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 1>It's designed to dissolve and destroy other businesses by undercutting them.</v>

274
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:43.951
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

275
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos argues that he should not be blamed for the downfall of these other</v>

276
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:51.070
<v Speaker 1>businesses because the future was coming no matter what,</v>

277
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.590
<v Speaker 1>whether it was him or someone else.</v>

278
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos says that whenever he makes a major business decision,</v>

279
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>he imagines himself at 80 years old and if he would be proud of his actions,</v>

280
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.193
<v Speaker 1>looking back,</v>

281
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 1>if the answer is yes,</v>

282
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>he listens to that intuition and he goes for it.</v>

283
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 1>By listening to his heart,</v>

284
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>he has become one of the most successful people in the world.</v>

285
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Amazon has been incredibly successful into lots of people.</v>

286
00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Attributed it to Jeff Bezos,</v>

287
00:12:23.691 --> 00:12:24.890
<v Speaker 1>has skills in leadership.</v>

288
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.280
<v Speaker 1>He has a list of core values for Amazon and see,</v>

289
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.130
<v Speaker 1>always abides by those rules himself.</v>

290
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.750
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the DOTCOM bubble,</v>

291
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:37.751
<v Speaker 1>the value of Amazon stock went from $113 per share all the way down to $6 per</v>

292
00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:39.560
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

293
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 1>For many members of the original team,</v>

294
00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:43.790
<v Speaker 1>they lost millions of dollars in their stock portfolio,</v>

295
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.930
<v Speaker 1>and this was enough to destroy the vast majority of those early Internet</v>

296
00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:48.740
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

297
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.940
<v Speaker 1>One of the many reasons why Amazon survived was that Jeff Bezos wasn't judging</v>

298
00:12:52.941 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>the business's success on the stock price.</v>

299
00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:00.080
<v Speaker 1>He knew that people were still using the website and it was growing every single</v>

300
00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

301
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.760
<v Speaker 1>as we mentioned before.</v>

302
00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

303
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it's always made his customers the number one priority.</v>

304
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you received a very serious complaint,</v>

305
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.120
<v Speaker 1>he would never try to reprimand his employees for making a mistake.</v>

306
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

307
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.740
<v Speaker 1>he would forward a particularly troubling customer complaints to the manager of</v>

308
00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:18.800
<v Speaker 1>each department with a simple question mark and the subject line.</v>

309
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.580
<v Speaker 1>According to former employees getting one of those question mark emails was</v>

310
00:13:22.581 --> 00:13:26.150
<v Speaker 1>terrifying and they would quickly do everything they could to fix the problem</v>

311
00:13:26.151 --> 00:13:26.984
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

312
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 1>When the issues were resolved,</v>

313
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.500
<v Speaker 1>bezos would simply reply with a smiley face if he sees a bad experience that a</v>

314
00:13:33.501 --> 00:13:34.251
<v Speaker 1>customer has.</v>

315
00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:39.251
<v Speaker 1>He uses it as a case study to improve the company overall and not just that one</v>

316
00:13:39.621 --> 00:13:41.720
<v Speaker 1>person's individual experience.</v>

317
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Amazon is now available in 16 countries,</v>

318
00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:48.380
<v Speaker 1>so he has had to give up much of the power over those branches of the companies</v>

319
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Speaker 1>and see you can't be everywhere at once.</v>

320
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Some countries are actually trying to fend off Amazon's monopoly in certain</v>

321
00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>

322
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.881
<v Speaker 1>In France,</v>

323
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:56.391
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

324
00:13:56.391 --> 00:13:57.830
<v Speaker 1>there is a law that no bookstore,</v>

325
00:13:57.831 --> 00:13:59.600
<v Speaker 1>whether it be online or in person,</v>

326
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.710
<v Speaker 1>is allowed to discount a book by more than five percent off the retail price and</v>

327
00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:06.470
<v Speaker 1>they can ask you a free shipping to entice buyers.</v>

328
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.921
<v Speaker 1>This way,</v>

329
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:09.920
<v Speaker 1>independent bookshops in France still thriving.</v>

330
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Only time is going to tell how many nations are going to adopt Amazon in the</v>

331
00:14:14.391 --> 00:14:15.224
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

332
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.880
<v Speaker 1>By a stroke of genius,</v>

333
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:27.881
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos has managed to run Amazon.com with this or to no profit despite the</v>

334
00:14:28.071 --> 00:14:32.090
<v Speaker 1>fact that they are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue every single year.</v>

335
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.560
<v Speaker 1>This is because he's always thinking about the future and trying to grow the</v>

336
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:40.580
<v Speaker 1>business to keep pushing the envelope and what is going to happen next.</v>

337
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Basically is still a true trekkie at heart,</v>

338
00:14:42.951 --> 00:14:46.730
<v Speaker 1>so it's really no surprise that he is creating a private space company called</v>

339
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.593
<v Speaker 1>blue origin.</v>

340
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Just like you said during his high school graduation speech.</v>

341
00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 1>He believes that someday it will be very normal for people to be living and</v>

342
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 1>working in space and he wants to be on the forefront of that few shot at the</v>

343
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:02.180
<v Speaker 1>time that we're making this video.</v>

344
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:07.181
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos is worth a hundred and 37 point $6,000,000,000 and that makes him the</v>

345
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>wealthiest man in all of history.</v>

346
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.503
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.com.</v>

347
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 1>It's been valued at over a trillion dollars and of course there is always the</v>

348
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 1>chance that this wealth will grow,</v>

349
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.090
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't just hoarding well if this money to himself,</v>

350
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>he created the Bezos family foundation and also the world what charitable cause</v>

351
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 1>he could help pay for.</v>

352
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 1>He received 47,000 emails with suggestions about where the money should go and</v>

353
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:34.520
<v Speaker 1>he spends a lot of time reading some of the best ideas for courses that truly</v>

354
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:35.210
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

355
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.050
<v Speaker 1>He said all of the best decisions are made with instinct,</v>

356
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.183
<v Speaker 1>intuition.</v>

357
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.233
<v Speaker 1>It's hot.</v>

358
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Bezos says that he wants to give his money away to many of these charities</v>

359
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>and invest more in startup business ideas that will help humanity.</v>

360
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>He decided to begin this journey by opening tuition free Montessori preschools</v>

361
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>and underprivileged communities so that children can have the same opportunities</v>

362
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>that he did,</v>

363
00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 1>and he also wants to open homeless shelters that allow an entire family to stay</v>

364
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>together instead of splitting men and women apart.</v>

365
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>As time goes on,</v>

366
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:09.851
<v Speaker 1>we'll see just how much Jeff Bezos uses his money for good and he's always open</v>

367
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 1>to suggestions,</v>

368
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.370
