7
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 1>It went far beyond the ring.</v>

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.340
<v Speaker 1>With this humble manner in his boundless trauma,</v>

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Andrea became one of the most famous and recognizable athletes on the planet and</v>

10
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>a genuine cultural phenomenon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>behind the celebrity.</v>

13
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Andrea was a man trapped inside a wells he never created and one that would</v>

14
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 1>ultimately destroy him.</v>

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>The man we know is Andre the giant entered the world as Andre or one of them off</v>

16
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.381
<v Speaker 1>on May,</v>

17
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>the 19th of 1946.</v>

18
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>His father had migrated from Belgium to France in 1934,</v>

19
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>settling in more just outside of Paris.</v>

20
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>In 1938,</v>

21
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Boris had married Marianne Petite Polish women who seemed began producing</v>

22
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>offspring.</v>

23
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Andre became the middle of five children.</v>

24
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Flores was a strong stout man who stood just over six feet tall.</v>

25
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>He works at the end as a farmer and seen put his children to work,</v>

26
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>cutting firewood,</v>

27
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>tending the stock,</v>

28
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>and otherwise getting their hands dirty as Andre was 11 pounds,</v>

29
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but there were no signs of abnormal growth during his first six years known as</v>

30
00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Dt as a result of a system is pronouncing his name.</v>

31
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.230
<v Speaker 1>He was a healthy good looking and charming child's,</v>

32
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but as he grew older,</v>

33
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>his rate of fiscal growth outstrips that of his peers.</v>

34
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>This was especially noticeable in his face were his drawer and foreheads became</v>

35
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 1>unusually pronounced.</v>

36
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Andrea,</v>

37
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>it again is ending school nearby.</v>

38
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>It will see some mall.</v>

39
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>He loved the social interaction and proved to be a good students,</v>

40
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>especially excelling at mathematics already.</v>

41
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>He towered over the other children,</v>

42
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.700
<v Speaker 1>not only those in his grades,</v>

43
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>but also those in any great he dominated in most sports.</v>

44
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Invariably finding himself in the position of goalie on the soccer field where</v>

45
00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>there's large hands and long limbs.</v>

46
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It was virtually impossible to get the ball past him.</v>

47
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>By the age of 10,</v>

48
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Andre stood at six feet tall and tip the scale at around 200 pounds.</v>

49
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>He looks,</v>

50
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>ends move like a full grown man on the farm.</v>

51
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>His father discovered he could do the work of three boys his age,</v>

52
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>so Boris took it out of school and put him to work full time on the farm.</v>

53
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>There is some office had little in the way of material possessions.</v>

54
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>They were a close family and the children were raised with love and dignity,</v>

55
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>though they simply learned to accept.</v>

56
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Watch came without complaints.</v>

57
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.510
<v Speaker 1>So when Andrea was taken from school though he missed the mental stimulation and</v>

58
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.110
<v Speaker 1>the association with the school mates,</v>

59
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>he threw himself into the life of a farmer.</v>

60
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

61
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.510
<v Speaker 1>That this was to be his lot.</v>

62
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 1>The physical labor coupled with Andres on natural growth potential allows him to</v>

63
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>develop a level of physical strength that stunned on look,</v>

64
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>it's by the age of 15.</v>

65
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>He was able to lift a car so that his brother could change the ta without having</v>

66
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>to worry about a wheel.</v>

67
00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Jack.</v>

68
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>It was around the age of 16 though that Andres growth spurt went to a whole new</v>

69
00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

70
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>is high too.</v>

71
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Approach seven feet and his weight went into the three hundreds.</v>

72
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.573
<v Speaker 1>But his parents,</v>

73
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>they will also really concerned about his growth spurts and Andre was never</v>

74
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>taken to see a doc sap during his mid teens,</v>

75
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Andrea,</v>

76
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

77
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>a woodworking apprenticeship.</v>

78
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>After two years of diligence,</v>

79
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>application and study,</v>

80
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>he decided that the trade was not for him and went to work at a factory that</v>

81
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>made hay baling entrance,</v>

82
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but the monotony of working on an assembly line was worse than what it had</v>

83
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>previously been doing.</v>

84
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Andre had dreams of doing something different.</v>

85
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't know what that was.</v>

86
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>With no other options.</v>

87
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>He went back to work for his father on the farm by now.</v>

88
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>His incredible size was constantly drawing attention and he became known as a</v>

89
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>local curiosity.</v>

90
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>By the time he was 18,</v>

91
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>his fame had spread as far as Paris.</v>

92
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>That was a wrestling promotion,</v>

93
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>so he'd gone to hear about the teenage giants who was stronger than three men.</v>

94
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>He took the trip to car and knocks on the door.</v>

95
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.670
<v Speaker 1>He told Boris and Marianne.</v>

96
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>There's some at a future in wrestling and the potential to make many Franks with</v>

97
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>his parents consent.</v>

98
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Andrea began learning the fundamentals of wrestling and was taken under the wing</v>

99
00:03:59.201 --> 00:03:59.891
<v Speaker 1>of Montreal.</v>

100
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Born wrestler runs promoter,</v>

101
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.961
<v Speaker 1>Frank Fowler,</v>

102
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

103
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>He began on the parisiene wrestling sac.</v>

104
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>It's under the name of Joel in honor of a mythical French giants.</v>

105
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

106
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Laundry worked as a furniture mover during the day in order to cover his</v>

107
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:23.610
<v Speaker 1>expenses in Paris.</v>

108
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.391
<v Speaker 1>After work,</v>

109
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 1>he could be found in a wrestling gym slowly developing his craft even though pro</v>

110
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:31.710
<v Speaker 1>wrestling then as now was more entertainment than sport.</v>

111
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It was still necessary for Andre to learn the basic moves,</v>

112
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>falls,</v>

113
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>and holds that would create the illusion of violence while keeping him from</v>

114
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:39.540
<v Speaker 1>injury.</v>

115
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.961
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

116
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>with is intimidating,</v>

117
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:41.730
<v Speaker 1>size and strength.</v>

118
00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to find an opponent who was willing to share the ring with him.</v>

119
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

120
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>progress was slope despite this,</v>

121
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>his sheer size and power insured,</v>

122
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>but he never lost in the ring.</v>

123
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>In 1965,</v>

124
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Andrea received a notice to report to the army's draft board.</v>

125
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>When he turned up for his physical exam,</v>

126
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>the recruiters could hardly believe what they saw.</v>

127
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>A 19 year old who stood over seven feet tall and weighed 350 pounds.</v>

128
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Despite his incredible strength in good health,</v>

129
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.850
<v Speaker 1>he was deemed unfit for service for the simple reason that the army did not have</v>

130
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 1>any uniforms or shoes that were big enough for him back in Paris,</v>

131
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.120
<v Speaker 1>only mess Eduardo Cop,</v>

132
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.670
<v Speaker 1>NCA,</v>

133
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.050
<v Speaker 1>a popular Montreal days,</v>

134
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Canadian wrestler all asking the old man to train him.</v>

135
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Andre spent the next two months learning valuable ring tips from the veteran</v>

136
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.010
<v Speaker 1>before leaving for home called Pansy advised Andre to get in the ring as much as</v>

137
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Speaker 1>possible and to build experience.</v>

138
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>He also promised that he would one day bring Andre over to North America were</v>

139
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 1>wrestling was much bigger than it was in Europe.</v>

140
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

141
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Andre continued paying his dues on the European seconds.</v>

142
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>He traveled around Europe and even as far as Africa developing a huge following</v>

143
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.930
<v Speaker 1>crowds were overwhelmed by his sheer physical size.</v>

144
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Then as the match began,</v>

145
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:53.040
<v Speaker 1>they were delighted to see how he overwhelmed his opponents.</v>

146
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 1>In 1969,</v>

147
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Andrea ventured off the European continent to wrestle in new where he was billed</v>

148
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>as Monster Eiffel Tower.</v>

149
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Then he went to Japan where he competed with an American partner in the Iwf</v>

150
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>World tag team champs.</v>

151
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>They've had one this isol and suddenly boundary was a world champion.</v>

152
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>It was while he was in Japan.</v>

153
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:11.610
<v Speaker 1>There's Andrea.</v>

154
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It was diagnosed by a doctor with the condition that had caused his unusual</v>

155
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

156
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>This condition was acromegaly.</v>

157
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a rare disorder of the pituitary glands,</v>

158
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>which leads to the overproduction of human growth hormone.</v>

159
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>It was caused by a benign tumor,</v>

160
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>which if it develops before bone growth was complete,</v>

161
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>would lead to gigantism.</v>

162
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>The doctor also informs Andre that life expectancy for people with the condition</v>

163
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>was 40 years.</v>

164
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Andrea told no one about his diagnosis,</v>

165
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>keeping the secret that at 20 his life was more than likely already half over,</v>

166
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's knowledge undoubtedly spurred him on to reach the top of his chosen</v>

167
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>profession as quickly as he possibly could.</v>

168
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Having now won a world wrestling title,</v>

169
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>he felt he had sufficiently paid his dues and was ready to take on the Americans</v>

170
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.080
<v Speaker 1>from Japan.</v>

171
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.980
<v Speaker 1>He traveled to Canada where he messed up with Eduardo carpentier.</v>

174
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

175
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 1>charm,</v>

176
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>and surprising agility in the ring.</v>

177
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>He would often be paired against two or even three opponents at a time in one on</v>

178
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:08.031
<v Speaker 1>one matches.</v>

179
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>He took on undefeated such Canadian luminaries as Calico while ski and butcher</v>

180
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] on at the same time as he was wrestling in Canada.</v>

181
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Andre made frequent trips back to Japan where he was immensely popular that he</v>

182
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>won the international wrestling federations weld series,</v>

184
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>and the process Andrea hard work in the ring was establishing him as a top</v>

185
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>international draw cart in 1971.</v>

186
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>He was named rookie of the year by the wrestling yearbook.</v>

187
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 72.</v>

188
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>His biggest match today's came in May 1972 when he was pitted against the six</v>

189
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>foot nine Mormon giants,</v>

190
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Don Leo,</v>

191
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan in what was built as the match of the century with 20,000 people on</v>

192
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

193
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 1>The match set an indoor wrestling attendance records.</v>

194
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Now this match was going Andre's way until he lost his temper.</v>

195
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And thrust is giant.</v>

196
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Hands around Leo's neck.</v>

197
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 1>When his locker room guys ran into stop him from choking out his opponents,</v>

198
00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Andre,</v>

199
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 1>toss them aside like ragdolls.</v>

200
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Eventually order was restored and Andrea was disqualified.</v>

201
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>He had lost the match,</v>

202
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>but it also established one of his key gimmicks.</v>

203
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 1>He wants a lovable giants,</v>

204
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you make him mad,</v>

205
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>he would turn into a killer.</v>

206
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>After the bout with Don Leah,</v>

207
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Andrea began adventuring south to the United States where he would appear as a</v>

208
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 1>special attraction on the American wrestling association carts.</v>

209
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Now it was time to reach out to the biggest player in the market,</v>

210
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Vincent j Dot Mcmahon.</v>

211
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>If the world wrestling federation,</v>

212
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Vince Mcmahon,</v>

213
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>was first introduced to the man who became his greatest superstar in June of</v>

214
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>1973.</v>

215
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Until then,</v>

216
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Andre had been wrestling under the name of Joel Fap.</v>

217
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Mcmahon's first move was to rebrand the trials.</v>

218
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 1>No one in America knew who's your fair was,</v>

219
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>but they could all relate to Andre the giant.</v>

220
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:57.841
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

221
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>as well as changing the name Mcmahon,</v>

222
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>also modified Andres onstage approach.</v>

223
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Up until now,</v>

224
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>he had shown remarkable athleticism.</v>

225
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Now he was to rely solely on his overwhelming size and bulk to defeat his</v>

226
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.764
<v Speaker 1>opponents.</v>

227
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Andres first maps onto the wwf banner,</v>

228
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 1>took place on March the 26th,</v>

229
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.601
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

230
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>73.</v>

231
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>He easily defeated buddy wolf at Madison Square Garden.</v>

232
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>The American audience had never seen anything like this giant of a man,</v>

233
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>and he was immediately a sensation mcmahon well,</v>

234
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 1>he knew a good thing when he saw it.</v>

235
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Booking Andre to perform night after night all over the country,</v>

236
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but keeping the big man moving,</v>

237
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Mckinnon was able to prevent the novelty of the gentle giants from wearing off</v>

238
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.190
<v Speaker 1>everywhere he went.</v>

239
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Andrea shattered box office records.</v>

240
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Mcmahon was capital,</v>

241
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

242
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>not to pin him against other top drawers for fear of damaging their prestige as</v>

243
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 1>his popularity extended beyond the wrestling community.</v>

244
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Andrea,</v>

245
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you began to receive offers for TV appearances in the late 19 seventies.</v>

246
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>He appeared on the tonight show.</v>

247
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 1>When's the Merv Griffin show,</v>

248
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>and was featured in such magazines as sports illustrated and people.</v>

249
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>In 1976,</v>

250
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood came calling the writer of the most popular show on television.</v>

251
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:08.490
<v Speaker 1>The $6,000,000 man had decided to capitalize on these string of Sasquatch</v>

252
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 1>reportings that had recently been made.</v>

253
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>They knew that there was only one man who could realistically play the eight</v>

254
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>foot tall forest creature,</v>

255
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>and so it was that Andre Day covered suits and prosthetic makeup and battles and</v>

256
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Lee majors has millions watched on television to the horror of his legion of</v>

257
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:27.181
<v Speaker 1>preteen fans.</v>

258
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>These $6,000,000 man was treated like a ragdoll by the sasquatch.</v>

259
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Andrea followed up his first acting role with a mixed discipline match fighting</v>

260
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 1>boxer,</v>

261
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Wepner in June of 1976 at New York's share stadium.</v>

262
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.890
<v Speaker 1>The actually was a knockoff of Mohammed Ali's famous matchup with Japanese</v>

263
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>wrestler Ren Tonio and Gnocchi weapon,</v>

264
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 1>or had one famous the only man to knock down Ali and to be Sylvester Stallone's.</v>

265
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Inspiration for rocky.</v>

266
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 1>The magic began with weapon,</v>

267
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>a taunting Andre while seconding him and throwing out a few jabs which the</v>

268
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 1>towering restless and but he ignored.</v>

269
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It was well aware that he could drop weapon at any moment,</v>

270
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>but wanted to give the audience their money's worth.</v>

271
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

272
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>in the third rounds weapon,</v>

273
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>no managed to get a shot in that connects it with Andres face and it was this</v>

274
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that got the big man's attention,</v>

275
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Andre Snort it,</v>

276
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and then his wepner with an inverted atomic it drop and to headbutt.</v>

277
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>He then picked the six foot three inch weapon are up like a ragdoll and threw</v>

278
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>him over the top rape.</v>

279
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 1>The match with weapon had been a fast,</v>

280
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>but it further cemented the legends of Andre's invincibility in 1977.</v>

281
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:29.960
<v Speaker 1>He was listed as pro wrestling illustrated.</v>

282
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Most popular wrestler promoters from all over the welds pleaded for him to come</v>

283
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>over and face off with our champion.</v>

284
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

285
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Andrea had many hypes rivalries and it's matchups.</v>

286
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 1>During the period of the late 19 seventies,</v>

287
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the greatest was with Ernie big cat lat,</v>

288
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.291
<v Speaker 1>the six foot nine,</v>

289
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>315 pounds.</v>

290
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Labs was a four time all star defensive tackle who went on to become a career</v>

291
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 1>wrestler.</v>

292
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 1>He developed a very arrogant persona.</v>

293
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 1>It has a pension for sticking his thumb in the eyes of his opponents.</v>

294
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

295
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>he was hugely unpopular and the perfect foil for Andrea.</v>

296
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.360
<v Speaker 1>The two wrestled regularly across the country and matches build as battle of the</v>

297
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 1>giants.</v>

298
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:17.881
<v Speaker 1>In 1988,</v>

299
00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Vince Mcmahon had Andrea up with an up and coming wrestler who had formerly been</v>

300
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:22.420
<v Speaker 1>a bodybuilder.</v>

301
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 1>His name was terry.</v>

302
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:28.531
<v Speaker 1>The layer that is wwf stage name was Hulk Hogan Mcmahon paired him up with a</v>

303
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 1>theatrical easy manager by the name of classy Freddie blassie.</v>

304
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Hoagie blassie were marketed as the ultimate cheat team and the ideal</v>

305
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 1>antagonists for the by the book Andre.</v>

306
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>The tactic worked a treat with Hogan becoming the most hated bad guy in wwf</v>

307
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>history at 330 pounds.</v>

308
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

309
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>marched his way through the federation's Lesser Stars.</v>

310
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 1>The fans demanded to match up with Andre and in March of 1980 mcmahon made it</v>

311
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

312
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Despite his character bravado,</v>

313
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Hogan was terrified to match up against Andre.</v>

314
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>The very thought of working match with the giants made him physically ill.</v>

315
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>The matchup that resulted seriously injured Hogan.</v>

316
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>He recalls that Andre messed up my shoulder,</v>

317
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 1>screwed my neck out,</v>

318
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>and Suplex to me on the head.</v>

319
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It soon became clear that Andrea has a personal dislike for Hogan.</v>

320
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>They traveled together to Japan for a series of mattress as they went around the</v>

321
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:17.020
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

322
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Andre continued to talk to the young wrestler,</v>

323
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the back of the bus so that he could bounce is empty beer cans off</v>

324
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the back of her head.</v>

325
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Hogan excepted the humiliating treatment as something of a rite of passage by</v>

326
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>the age of 34.</v>

327
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Andre had become the biggest thing in the world of wrestling,</v>

328
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but to those outside of that world,</v>

329
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 1>he was generally seen as little more than a side show freak.</v>

330
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 1>He was constantly subjected to the stairs and jeers of the public and then there</v>

331
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 1>were the discomforts imposed by his guard down and she went frame and he</v>

332
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 1>suffered from agonizing back pain and joint elements and he could never find a</v>

333
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>chair or a bed.</v>

334
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>The provided anything approaching compass,</v>

335
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and of course always in the back of his mind was the knowledge that his time was</v>

336
00:13:57.461 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 1>running out.</v>

337
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't meant to make it past 40.</v>

338
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.241
<v Speaker 1>Andres.</v>

339
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Appetite for food was impressive,</v>

340
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but it was nothing compared to his liking.</v>

341
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol,</v>

342
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>he loved French wine and would often drink an entire case before lunch,</v>

343
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 1>during more than one all night drinking session,</v>

344
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.600
<v Speaker 1>he would knock back in excess of 100 handles of beer and even after this he</v>

345
00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:18.250
<v Speaker 1>would show this little sign of drunkenness.</v>

346
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Andrea and Hogan continued in their [inaudible] through the end of 1980,</v>

347
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 1>drawing huge crowds,</v>

348
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 1>but by the next year,</v>

349
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Hogan had left the wwf over a disagreement with mcmahon over his role in rocky</v>

350
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>three as an 1981 began.</v>

351
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Andre was at the top of his game.</v>

352
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 1>His rivalry with Hogan was soon replaced with an ongoing feud with the Mongolian</v>

353
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>giant killer Khan and I'm actually in 1981 con broad Andre to the canvas,</v>

354
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>leaving vaginas unable to get up.</v>

355
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>His ankle had snaps.</v>

356
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:45.421
<v Speaker 1>Andrea,</v>

357
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>it was out for several weeks in the storyline was that he was out for revenge.</v>

358
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Vein as again on July the 20th,</v>

359
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>1981,</v>

360
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.440
<v Speaker 1>but the match ended in a double disqualification.</v>

361
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Andre ones owns and dominates through the early to mid eighties.</v>

362
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>On April the seventh,</v>

363
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.151
<v Speaker 1>1986,</v>

364
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>he prevailed in a 20 man battle royale to come off the fixer at wrestle mania to</v>

365
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>following Wrestlemania to Andre,</v>

366
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>took a break from wrestling after a decade and a half in the ring his body,</v>

367
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:13.060
<v Speaker 1>it was breaking down the health effects of his disease where I'll say</v>

368
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:13.903
<v Speaker 1>compounding.</v>

369
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 1>During this period,</v>

370
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>he was given a pause in the Rob Reiner directed movie,</v>

371
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>the princess bride.</v>

372
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 1>He played the role of the lovable drudge physic and what has become a cult movie</v>

373
00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>classic rezonings to the WWF.</v>

374
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 1>In 1987,</v>

375
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Andre faced up to his old nemesis,</v>

376
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Hulk Hogan,</v>

377
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>who was also back in the wwf fault.</v>

378
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>At wrestlemania three,</v>

379
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Andre weighed in at 520 pounds.</v>

380
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.980
<v Speaker 1>This puts a huge strain on his joints and his lower back causing constant pain</v>

381
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 1>in the final match shop.</v>

382
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Hogan defeated Andre with what became known as the body slam heard around the</v>

383
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:45.980
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>

384
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Hogan tourism has Dorsi muscle in the monumental effort required to hoist the</v>

385
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:51.510
<v Speaker 1>giants over.</v>

386
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Had Andre though he got his revenge and a rematch that was ed on the main events</v>

387
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 1>in February of 1988.</v>

388
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 1>He defeated Hogan and took the wwf world heavyweight championship from him.</v>

389
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Andre went on for another four years,</v>

390
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't the wrestler that he had been in the past.</v>

391
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.690
<v Speaker 1>His body was racked with pain sometimes to the point that he couldn't stand</v>

392
00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 1>without leaning on the ropes.</v>

393
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Andre owned a ranch in North Carolina and spend more and more time.</v>

394
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 1>There is this health deteriorated.</v>

395
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 1>He was there and then January of 1993 when he heard that his father had died</v>

396
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>back in France.</v>

397
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 1>He helps on the next plane in order to attend the funeral.</v>

398
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 1>After the funeral,</v>

399
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>he stayed on to spend time with his mother and siblings.</v>

400
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>On the night of January the 27th,</v>

401
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 1>he died in his sleep as a result of congestive heart failure.</v>

402
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 1>His mother intended to bury him alongside his father,</v>

403
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 1>but Andre had recently revised as well stating that he wished to be cremated in</v>

404
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.410
<v Speaker 1>accordance with his wishes.</v>

405
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.610
<v Speaker 1>His ashes were returned to the United States and scattered on the grounds of his</v>

406
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:56.200
<v Speaker 1>ranch hotel,</v>

407
