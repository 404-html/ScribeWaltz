<v Speaker 1>He wants the personification of the evil dictator clad in his familiar khaki</v>

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>uniform men's cap and chomping on a cigar.</v>

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>He ruled with an iron fist over his island nation.</v>

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>He took on the United States and brought the world to the brink of nuclear</v>

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:14.904
<v Speaker 1>holocaust,</v>

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>shifting his attention to his own country.</v>

7
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>He decimated the economy,</v>

8
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>creating a communistic dictatorship that forced the people to revere him even as</v>

9
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>he ruined their lives.</v>

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>In this episode of Biographics,</v>

11
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>we take a closer look at the life of Fidel Castro.</v>

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Del Castro was born on August the 13th 1926 and the small farming village of</v>

13
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:52.990
<v Speaker 1>monogamous in northern rnt and Cuba.</v>

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>His father and Heller caster you Gus had emigrated from Spain in 1898 and picks</v>

15
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>up work as a brick layer and the railroad worker before starting his own</v>

16
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>business selling lemonade to field workers.</v>

17
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>From this humble start,</v>

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>he built a small sugarcane embark and praising 26,000 acres and 300 work</v>

19
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And how's the first wife Maria go?</v>

21
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I gave birth to two children and then either died or simply walked out on the</v>

22
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

23
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.411
<v Speaker 1>Unhealth soon.</v>

24
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Took up with his young,</v>

25
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>made leaner Roos Gonzalez who bore him.</v>

26
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Three children and Yella of Amman and Fidel.</v>

27
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>The couple were married shortly after Fidel is birth.</v>

28
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>They were a relatively wealthy family who lived in a deletion style two story</v>

29
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>house in the country still.</v>

30
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>They did live a decidedly country lifestyle with chickens and pigs wandering</v>

31
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>through the house.</v>

32
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Fidel was named after a local politician with his name,</v>

33
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>meaning faithful.</v>

34
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>He did have his father's temperaments,</v>

35
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>which meant he was prone to violence outbursts.</v>

36
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>His sister recalls that if he was playing baseball and just team we're losing.</v>

37
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 1>He would simply gather up the equipments and walk off the fields.</v>

38
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Close friends and future novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez recalled that Fidel was</v>

39
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 1>the worst loser that did have a mask when he reached school age.</v>

40
00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Fidel was sent to study and Santiago,</v>

41
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>the second largest city in Cuba for the first two years.</v>

42
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>He stayed with his godparents and was homeschooled by them.</v>

43
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.691
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

44
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>he was enrolled at the Maris Lasalle school along with brothers Ramond and Raul.</v>

45
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Fidel soon gained a reputation as a troublemaker.</v>

46
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I was a bit of a bullied when he was in the fourth grade.</v>

47
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Fidel's father received a letter stating that his three boys with the biggest</v>

48
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>bullies in the entire school and how was furious and pulled the boys out of the</v>

49
00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

50
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>This enraged with Al who threatened to burn the house down.</v>

51
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>He ended up being sent to a more demanding Jesuit school in Havana with his</v>

52
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>father threatening to cut off his allowance if his grades dropped below a</v>

53
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>certain level.</v>

54
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Fidel responses to this by forging his school reports.</v>

55
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Carsguru proved to be a decidedly average students,</v>

56
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but there was one area in which he excelled.</v>

57
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>He had a photographic memory of facts,</v>

58
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>which hugely impressed his fellow students.</v>

59
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.941
<v Speaker 1>They would call them,</v>

60
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>do a page number from their tax books,</v>

61
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>and he would recite the page word for word in his team's.</v>

62
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Fidel began to develop his ability as a public speaker and there's a debater.</v>

63
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>After an initial rejection,</v>

64
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>he gained acceptance into the Allover Bernardo Literary Academy,</v>

65
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>which was the literary wing at the Jesuit School.</v>

66
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>At first he was paralyzed by stage fright,</v>

67
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>but he gradually became more relaxed and more confidence in his presentations</v>

68
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>and obviously a very of 1945 Fidel entered law school at the University of</v>

69
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Havana.</v>

70
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.951
<v Speaker 1>At the time,</v>

71
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>the university was a self governing body which for bead the police or army from</v>

72
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>setting foot on campus.</v>

73
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

74
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>it was a hotbed of clandestine activity by gangsters and political agitators.</v>

75
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It was a very attractive environment for the hot headed Castro.</v>

76
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Fidelis first foray,</v>

77
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:44.930
<v Speaker 1>NC political imagination was precipitated by a rise in bus fares that had been</v>

78
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:47.930
<v Speaker 1>authorized by Cuban precedents ram on growl.</v>

79
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Castro organized a protest against the fair raisins,</v>

80
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.790
<v Speaker 1>led a march to the presidential palace.</v>

81
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>The police beat the students with Fidel himself receiving slight injuries.</v>

82
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.740
<v Speaker 1>He used this incident to his advantage by going to the press and receiving some</v>

83
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:01.880
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic coverage.</v>

84
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>At the time the Castro in roles at the university,</v>

85
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:07.460
<v Speaker 1>there were two main gangster groups who were vying for control,</v>

86
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.350
<v Speaker 1>the socialist revolutionary movements,</v>

87
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Msr,</v>

88
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.040
<v Speaker 1>and as the insurrection or revolutionary union you,</v>

89
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Iowa,</v>

90
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.340
<v Speaker 1>there were frequent violent clashes between these two groups.</v>

91
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Fidel quickly sized up the situation and began to maneuver between the two</v>

92
00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

93
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.080
<v Speaker 1>In December of 1946 there was an assassination attempt on a leading member of</v>

94
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:27.230
<v Speaker 1>the Uir and Castro was fingered as the trigger man.</v>

95
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>His that seem to motive here was that he wants it to ingratiate himself with the</v>

96
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>MSR leadership.</v>

97
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

98
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it was the leader of Ui,</v>

99
00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:34.544
<v Speaker 1>Emilio Troy,</v>

100
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.200
<v Speaker 1>who took Castro under his wing.</v>

101
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.550
<v Speaker 1>He gave Fidel the pistol,</v>

102
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 1>which the young budding revolutionary carries with them at all times throwing.</v>

103
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.910
<v Speaker 1>They'd been planning and invasion of the Dominican Republic in conjunction with</v>

104
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 1>a group of Dominican exiles in response to the terrible conditions brought about</v>

105
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>by the rule of Rafael Trujillo.</v>

106
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Task very quickly jumps on board and sales without 12,000 fellow revolutionaries</v>

107
00:04:53.181 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>to Kayak on fetus on July the 29th 1947 for two months they arms.</v>

108
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.310
<v Speaker 1>When's paramilitary training before setting off for the Dominican mainlands.</v>

109
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

110
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.690
<v Speaker 1>three Ho had learned of the plans attack and didn't even appeal to the United</v>

111
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.691
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

112
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:06.260
<v Speaker 1>For Eight,</v>

113
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 1>the revolutionary leaders got cold feet and cools off the invasion.</v>

114
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:10.101
<v Speaker 1>Ams,</v>

115
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:13.820
<v Speaker 1>the embarrassed given army began rounding up the ships and taking the would be</v>

116
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:14.930
<v Speaker 1>attack is into custody.</v>

117
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Castrate managed to evade custody by jumping ship and swimming eight miles to</v>

118
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:20.450
<v Speaker 1>the shore.</v>

119
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.310
<v Speaker 1>In 1947 Castro visitors a new model prison on the isle of Pines as part of his</v>

120
00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:26.144
<v Speaker 1>legal studies,</v>

121
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.780
<v Speaker 1>my name or sons,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Havana,</v>

123
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.040
<v Speaker 1>he criticized the prison and it's inhumane treatment of its inhabitants.</v>

124
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>The following year,</v>

125
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.760
<v Speaker 1>he was part of a student congress that traveled to Bogota,</v>

126
00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Colombia.</v>

127
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.510
<v Speaker 1>On April the seventh the group maps with the leader of the Liberal Party,</v>

128
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Jorge Gasten,</v>

129
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>who looked likely to win the upcoming election.</v>

130
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Two days later though,</v>

131
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Gaten was shot debt.</v>

132
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Bogota erupted in violence and the students from Cuba,</v>

133
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 1>we're caught in the middle of it.</v>

134
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Castro became actively involved participating in the takeover of a police</v>

135
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:53.210
<v Speaker 1>station.</v>

136
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.043
<v Speaker 1>After three days,</v>

137
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>the authorities restored order,</v>

138
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>but not before some 3,500 people had been killed.</v>

139
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Gastro returns in Havana where he became a follower of Senator Eddie.</v>

140
00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>He bus the main opponents of president ground.</v>

141
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>He was the founder of the Cubans.</v>

142
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>People party.</v>

143
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Castro campaigned hard for hibiscus and is unsuccessful bid for the presidency</v>

144
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>in 1948 I'm still the two men whenever close.</v>

145
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Keep us all.</v>

146
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Fidel as somewhat of an embarrassment user has gangsta backgrounds and Fidel</v>

147
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>only ever viewed the leader as an obstacle to his own path to power.</v>

148
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>In order to gain political respectability,</v>

149
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Castro cut off his association with his gangster associates.</v>

150
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>He gave speeches on campus denouncing the two main gangs and naming names of</v>

151
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>those who were responsible for criminal activity.</v>

152
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>This made him a target for both groups and he was forced into hiding around this</v>

153
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

154
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.941
<v Speaker 1>Fidel,</v>

155
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 1>who was generally awkward and shy around women,</v>

156
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's martyr Diaz Balart,</v>

160
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Most of their time was spent in New York where Fidel learn some English.</v>

161
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.261
<v Speaker 1>We're starting to Cuba.</v>

162
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 1>The newlyweds moved into a hotel across the street from a military camp in</v>

163
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Havana.</v>

164
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 1>In September of 1949 matter gave birth to a son who would become known as Fidel</v>

165
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Ito.</v>

166
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Having graduated from University of Fidel,</v>

167
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>began a small law practice,</v>

168
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>most of his title.</v>

169
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

170
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.630
<v Speaker 1>we spent dabbling in politics on August the 15th 1951 people's party leader at</v>

171
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 1>he hit us,</v>

172
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 1>was giving his usual Sunday radio address,</v>

173
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>urging the people to stop accepting the corruption of the government and take</v>

174
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

175
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Even pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the stomach.</v>

176
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>The dramatic act was intended to rouse the people keep us had spoken for too</v>

177
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>long and to suicide attempt.</v>

178
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not broadcast for the next 11 days.</v>

179
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Keep us lay in a hospital bed in terrible agony.</v>

180
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

181
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>his side.</v>

182
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>The entire time was Fidel Castro.</v>

183
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>When the leader died,</v>

184
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Castro was prominence as part of the honor guard that stood outside the</v>

185
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>university hall of Honor Work.</v>

186
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Give us in state how's the military escorts prepared to lead the body through</v>

187
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>the streets in a large procession,</v>

188
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Castro and treated the captain to divert the root to the presidential palace.</v>

189
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Fidel was convinced that he could rouse the people to overthrow the government,</v>

190
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>but the army captain refused fairing.</v>

191
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>There's an absolute bloodbath.</v>

192
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>We didn't see him the following year.</v>

193
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Castro ran for a seat on the Chamber of Deputies.</v>

194
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>He managed to garner the support of the majority of the People's Party members</v>

195
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and looked in line to when the upcoming election.</v>

196
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.431
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

197
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>on March the 10th former presidents for NCO Battista stage a military coup and</v>

198
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:33.360
<v Speaker 1>seized.</v>

199
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

200
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>he began rounding up his political adversaries,</v>

201
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 1>including members of the People's Party.</v>

202
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Fidel and his brother Raul went into hiding the buddies to queue diverted Castro</v>

203
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>from what could have been the promising diplomatic Korea in favor of becoming a</v>

204
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>fully fledged revolutionary.</v>

205
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>You gathered together his own political group,</v>

206
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 1>drawn from former party members and followers from his university days traveling</v>

207
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>up and down the country,</v>

208
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.420
<v Speaker 1>put his oratorical lands,</v>

209
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 1>propaganda skills to full of facts off to 14 months.</v>

210
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>He had a following of 12,000 people.</v>

211
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.010
<v Speaker 1>He ran his organization with military precision and discipline.</v>

212
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Drinking alcohol was forbidden and t imposed strict sexual standards.</v>

213
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.060
<v Speaker 1>He also organized his forces at a cellular level.</v>

214
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.900
<v Speaker 1>We have members of each cell being unaware of the existence of other cells.</v>

215
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.310
<v Speaker 1>By the middle of 1953 Castro had the support base that he needed to stage his</v>

216
00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:31.000
<v Speaker 1>own COO,</v>

217
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.691
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have,</v>

218
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:34.360
<v Speaker 1>there were weapons or indeed the money to buy them.</v>

219
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.840
<v Speaker 1>His solution was to attack a military base and sees its weapons.</v>

220
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.990
<v Speaker 1>The base selectors was located at Mancado.</v>

221
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.531
<v Speaker 1>The attack,</v>

222
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:41.861
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

223
00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:43.090
<v Speaker 1>and was bungled from the start.</v>

224
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.960
<v Speaker 1>One of the 26 vehicles on route to the base had a flat tire and other took a</v>

225
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.870
<v Speaker 1>wrong turn and did not arrive until the attack was well underway.</v>

226
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.360
<v Speaker 1>When the remainder of the vehicles arrive to the base,</v>

227
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.660
<v Speaker 1>they were surprised to find it heavily fortified the military defenders,</v>

228
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.140
<v Speaker 1>so beach back the invaders with eight of Castro's men being killed,</v>

229
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.093
<v Speaker 1>the remains or floods,</v>

230
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but over the next few days,</v>

231
00:10:01.511 --> 00:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>many of them were rounded up by the authorities.</v>

232
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.970
<v Speaker 1>69 of them are eventually tortured and put to death.</v>

233
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Castro himself was put on trial before a military tribunal.</v>

234
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.960
<v Speaker 1>He used the opportunity to speak out about the regime of Patista as the harsh</v>

235
00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.850
<v Speaker 1>treatments of his fellow revolutionaries.</v>

236
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.520
<v Speaker 1>His courtroom defense statements of history will absolve me,</v>

237
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 1>which become probably his most famous speech still.</v>

238
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.170
<v Speaker 1>He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years and imprisonments Castro and his</v>

239
00:10:26.171 --> 00:10:28.000
<v Speaker 1>followers were sent to the previous dimensions.</v>

240
00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Isle of Pines Prison for doubt.</v>

241
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Muse does time that as who instilled a supreme level of order and discipline and</v>

242
00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 1>as men,</v>

243
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the Castro rebels gains a reputation for their good behavior and were given</v>

244
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.710
<v Speaker 1>great freedom.</v>

245
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Then on march the sixth 1954 Boeing's public pressure President Battista</v>

246
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.870
<v Speaker 1>grounded amnesty to Castro and dismantle the show of good faith from the</v>

247
00:10:46.871 --> 00:10:47.261
<v Speaker 1>president's.</v>

248
00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:47.630
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

249
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.350
<v Speaker 1>did not stop Castro from speaking out about the regime.</v>

250
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.490
<v Speaker 1>When two of his men were beaten by Battista enforces Fidel became increasingly</v>

251
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:55.990
<v Speaker 1>concerned for his own safety.</v>

252
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.740
<v Speaker 1>He would move houses every two to three days and then just two months after</v>

253
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:00.910
<v Speaker 1>being released from prison,</v>

254
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.590
<v Speaker 1>he left Cuba from Mexico.</v>

255
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It was Casper.</v>

256
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Plan to build up and train a new wing of his revolutionary army in Mexico and to</v>

257
00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:12.610
<v Speaker 1>then return to join forces with those already in Havana and a huge push to oust</v>

258
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.600
<v Speaker 1>the Patista regime is Mexican army began as a group of about 60 cube and the</v>

259
00:11:16.601 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 1>factors who lived in six small houses under strict disciplinary conditions</v>

260
00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:22.030
<v Speaker 1>imposed by Fidel.</v>

261
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It was during this period that castering that Ernesto Che Guevara,</v>

262
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.390
<v Speaker 1>who would play a key role in the coming revolution.</v>

263
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Castro launched his revolution in late November,</v>

264
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.360
<v Speaker 1>1956 from the port of Tox Pan on the Mexican coast.</v>

265
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 1>It was planned to coincide with another uprising organized by a rival antibodies</v>

266
00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:42.850
<v Speaker 1>to group for Dell had bought a 60 foot boat that was designed to take a maximum</v>

267
00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:47.851
<v Speaker 1>of 25 passengers and deepen the old 82 of his men on board as it shoved its way</v>

268
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:48.754
<v Speaker 1>towards Cuba.</v>

269
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.190
<v Speaker 1>The boat was in constant danger of capsizing.</v>

270
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 1>The journey was so slow that the five day trip took seven days,</v>

271
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they would miss the uprising of the other group with the boats</v>

272
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>beach at a place called purgatory points.</v>

273
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 1>On December the second,</v>

274
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.201
<v Speaker 1>but by now,</v>

275
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but he's designy who had already put down the fast rebellion had landed that</v>

276
00:12:05.371 --> 00:12:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Castro was on his way and his,</v>

277
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 1>that he had planes overhead ready to strafe the invaders and bomb the area.</v>

278
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Only about a dozen men survived Castro and Guevara or among them they again a</v>

279
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 1>three day march through the forest,</v>

280
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>constantly being hounded from the ad by the Cuban air force.</v>

281
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 1>They finally reached the Sierra Maestra region where they settled with the local</v>

282
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>villages and began to regroup.</v>

283
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.193
<v Speaker 1>Six weeks later,</v>

284
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Castro led 33 men on a gorilla raid on a tiny army garrison in La Plata.</v>

285
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Two soldiers were killed and the rebels stole off with a number of weapons.</v>

286
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>A month after this attack,</v>

287
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>gastric decided it was time to get its propaganda machine in motion.</v>

288
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 1>He sent one of his men to Havana to bring a foreign journalist back to the camp.</v>

289
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 1>The man chosen was from the New York Times and Suny three part story had</v>

290
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 1>appeared in the paper describing the massive military buildup.</v>

291
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Castro was organizing in the south of Cuba,</v>

292
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Castro support based group exponentially with more and more disaffected Cubans</v>

293
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 1>joining his rags.</v>

294
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>In March of 1958 younger brother Raul began to establish the second force out of</v>

295
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Oriente,</v>

296
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>which soon grew in number.</v>

297
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Raul proved to be a highly capable military commander with his force capturing</v>

298
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:08.800
<v Speaker 1>and destroying many planes,</v>

299
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.420
<v Speaker 1>tanks and military vehicles.</v>

300
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>In April for the cold calls upon the people of Cuba to stage and nationwide</v>

301
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 1>strike,</v>

302
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>he believed that this would be the start of his long plans uprising.</v>

303
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>President Battista responded by threatening to shoot anyone who participated in</v>

304
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>the strike.</v>

305
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.300
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

306
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 1>more than 140 people were shot down in the street,</v>

307
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.040
<v Speaker 1>but this action only fueled Castro support base and it's even more people stream</v>

308
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 1>to support him with the tight now decidedly turned in his favor.</v>

309
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Castro decided to move.</v>

310
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>He sent Che Guevara and another of his commanders,</v>

311
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Camilo [inaudible] goes on a Westwood march towards Savannah.</v>

312
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Along with their rebel forces.</v>

313
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 1>The government forces put up virtually no resistance and the rebels were able to</v>

314
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:46.601
<v Speaker 1>take control.</v>

315
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>One town after another on December the 31st 1958 with Castro's men closing in,</v>

316
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but he start resigned and fled the country.</v>

317
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Three days later,</v>

318
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Castro arrived in Santiago to a hero's welcome.</v>

319
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.160
<v Speaker 1>He gave a speech in front of 200,000 people.</v>

320
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I was later Guevara or NCN for he goes,</v>

321
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>marched into Havana and seized control of the reins of power and just like that,</v>

322
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.950
<v Speaker 1>the Castro era had begun yet</v>

323
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:23.090
<v Speaker 1>transfer of power with amazingly orderly Castro would want his mat and against</v>

324
00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:24.530
<v Speaker 1>fluting or destroying property.</v>

325
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.670
<v Speaker 1>He had come to power on the backs of an army of poor and illiterate peasants.</v>

326
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Now that he had gained power,</v>

327
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.450
<v Speaker 1>he would need to educate men to help him govern.</v>

328
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.381
<v Speaker 1>He tries to a point,</v>

329
00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:34.310
<v Speaker 1>his former professor,</v>

330
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Jose Miro Cardona as prime minister,</v>

331
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Renzi Manwell Aricia to be president.</v>

332
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.690
<v Speaker 1>He made himself supreme commander of the armed forces behind the scenes.</v>

333
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:43.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

334
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.170
<v Speaker 1>gastro put the organization in place to ensure that he was the holder of overall</v>

335
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.070
<v Speaker 1>power in the weeks following the revolution.</v>

336
00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>More than 500 Patista officials were tried,</v>

337
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.543
<v Speaker 1>convicted,</v>

338
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:53.443
<v Speaker 1>and put to death.</v>

339
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>That number would rise to 1,900 over the coming year.</v>

340
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Within seven months of seizing power,</v>

341
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Castro decided that he no longer had any need for a public governments.</v>

342
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.760
<v Speaker 1>On July the 16th,</v>

343
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 1>he announced that he was resigning his position as on Monza because he could no</v>

344
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 1>longer work with precedent.</v>

345
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

346
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 1>he had accused him of corruption.</v>

347
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Castro then disappeared for a number of days.</v>

348
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Justice Fidel had intended the people who rose up in protest and demanded that</v>

349
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>the president must go the fries and the president sought sanctuary in the</v>

350
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan embassy before escaping the country.</v>

351
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>This allowed Castro to resent it in triumph and to point himself as President</v>

352
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Castro.</v>

353
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Now in post totalitarian rule,</v>

354
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 1>those who did not give him that absolute support.</v>

355
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 1>We're in danger of being seized and put on trial or just simply shot.</v>

356
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Within a few short months,</v>

357
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 1>all signs of resistance within Cuba,</v>

358
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 1>including critical media,</v>

359
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 1>had simply been removed.</v>

360
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.531
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

361
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Castro fixed his attention on securing external security.</v>

362
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

363
00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Speaker 1>focus was perched on increasing the size and the strength of his army.</v>

364
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Six months soft up seizing power,</v>

365
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Castro and visited the United States where he was greeted with enthusiasm by the</v>

366
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 1>media as well as politicians and the public behind the scenes.</v>

367
00:15:58.941 --> 00:15:59.450
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

368
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the Eisenhower governments was already making plans for Castro's removal</v>

369
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.390
<v Speaker 1>in February of 1960 the Cuban leader signs and agreements with the Russians by</v>

370
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 1>which Cuban sugar would be traded for military arms and oil.</v>

371
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 1>This was at the height of the Cold War and many of the oil refineries in Cuba</v>

372
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.280
<v Speaker 1>where American owns when the owners refuse to process Soviet oil imports,</v>

373
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Castro sees their businesses.</v>

374
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>The U s government responded by cutting 700,000 tons from the U S and your</v>

375
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 1>purchase commitments intern at Castro nationalized Usi and its agriculture and</v>

376
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>industrial businesses.</v>

377
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Castro has move,</v>

378
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 1>had a huge impact on the u s mafia,</v>

379
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 1>which would cost about a hundred million dollars worth of property in the</v>

380
00:16:44.331 --> 00:16:45.590
<v Speaker 1>tourist industry alone.</v>

381
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>During this period of nationalization,</v>

382
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.910
<v Speaker 1>more than 200 thousands professional and upper costs,</v>

383
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 1>citizens fled the country.</v>

384
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Relations between the United States and Cuban government's became so strange</v>

385
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 1>that in March of 1960 President Eisenhower greenlit the training of a group of</v>

386
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Cuban exiles to stage an invasion and seek control.</v>

387
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.910
<v Speaker 1>The bowl was picked up by President Kennedy resulting in the disastrous Bay of</v>

388
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:08.744
<v Speaker 1>Pigs invasion,</v>

389
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>gastric gusts of winds of the invasion,</v>

390
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>and how does forces ready and waiting with their lack of promised USS support.</v>

391
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.870
<v Speaker 1>The Cuban rebels cut to pieces on December the first 1961 Castro when's on</v>

392
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>national television and Declan's that he was a Marxist Leninist and would be</v>

393
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.640
<v Speaker 1>until the day he died.</v>

394
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>The Soviets took eight where he view of their newly declared communist fellow</v>

395
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.150
<v Speaker 1>that the Americans responded immediately imposing a total economic blockade from</v>

396
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

397
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>This led to economic disaster with massive food shortages resulting.</v>

398
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.471
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

399
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:41.810
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet government decided to embrace Castro.</v>

400
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>They offered to station Soviet missiles on the islands.</v>

401
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 1>In Middle October,</v>

402
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 1>1962 the American government's got concrete evidence of the missile operation</v>

403
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>leading to what became known as the Cuban missile crisis.</v>

404
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Resident Kennedy placed a total military blockade around Cuba and announced that</v>

405
00:17:56.311 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 1>a military attack from Cuba on any nation would be seen as a direct attack by</v>

406
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:03.180
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union on the United States.</v>

407
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Castro urged the Russians to make a preemptive strike on the United States if</v>

408
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the Americans attacks the islands after 13 days during which the world was a</v>

409
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:13.200
<v Speaker 1>hair trigger away from nuclear destruction,</v>

410
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.380
<v Speaker 1>the Russians backed down and agreed to remove the missiles.</v>

411
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Castro was left completely out of the negotiation process and he was not happy.</v>

412
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Soviet president's,</v>

413
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Nikita Khrushchev tries to placate him by inviting Castro on a 40 day trip</v>

414
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:26.640
<v Speaker 1>through the Soviet Union.</v>

415
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:27.541
<v Speaker 1>During the trip,</v>

416
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Khrushchev offered to provide economic aid to the struggling islands.</v>

417
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>In 1965 the United States announced that it was willing to take in Cuban</v>

418
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 1>refugees.</v>

419
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:40.850
<v Speaker 1>This led to a mass exodus with a result in huge loss of skills and manpower on</v>

420
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:41.694
<v Speaker 1>the island</v>

421
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.480
<v Speaker 1>with international situation and having settled Castro satisfied [inaudible] on</v>

422
00:18:55.481 --> 00:18:58.420
<v Speaker 1>making agricultural reforms to improve the economy.</v>

423
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.350
<v Speaker 1>He wants to increase the sugar harvest and set a target for national production.</v>

424
00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:07.351
<v Speaker 1>In 1965 5.5 million tons increasing to 10 million tons by 1970 these</v>

425
00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:09.371
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>

426
00:19:09.371 --> 00:19:09.910
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

427
00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.770
<v Speaker 1>they were totally unreasonable still,</v>

428
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.550
<v Speaker 1>he paused nearly all of the country's economic resources into the sugar cane</v>

429
00:19:15.551 --> 00:19:16.210
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

430
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.250
<v Speaker 1>leaving all other economic activity.</v>

431
00:19:18.251 --> 00:19:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Baron,</v>

432
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.630
<v Speaker 1>the whole country,</v>

433
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:20.620
<v Speaker 1>including the elderly,</v>

434
00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:24.040
<v Speaker 1>young children and military workers were put to work in the fields in a</v>

435
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:26.290
<v Speaker 1>desperate quest to reach his targets.</v>

436
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Even Castro himself,</v>

437
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.430
<v Speaker 1>we sent two of cut cane for four hours every day.</v>

438
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.810
<v Speaker 1>How's the rest of the Cuban economy?</v>

439
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It fell by 20 and 40% the sugar cane project failed dismally to reach its</v>

440
00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:37.780
<v Speaker 1>projected targets.</v>

441
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.160
<v Speaker 1>In 1970 Castro announced that the plant had failed typical of his flat for the</v>

442
00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Speaker 1>dramatic.</v>

443
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.230
<v Speaker 1>He resigned his presidency.</v>

444
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.610
<v Speaker 1>The people demanded that he returned and soon he was back in power and the sugar</v>

445
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.870
<v Speaker 1>crisis was behind him.</v>

446
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the 1970s Castro began looking for ways to extend his influence</v>

447
00:19:54.281 --> 00:19:54.850
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>

448
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.510
<v Speaker 1>He began involving himself in revolutionary movements and sending forces to</v>

449
00:19:58.511 --> 00:20:00.700
<v Speaker 1>train and lead various guerrilla operations.</v>

450
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.420
<v Speaker 1>It's supportive.</v>

451
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Civil wars in Angola and Somalia ate up more of his countries with limited</v>

452
00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:06.064
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

453
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:10.300
<v Speaker 1>During the early 1980s sugar prices and production has increased significantly.</v>

454
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.220
<v Speaker 1>This allowed the Cuban economy to grow at a rate of 24% but when the sugar price</v>

455
00:20:15.221 --> 00:20:16.150
<v Speaker 1>slumped dramatically,</v>

456
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Cuba's international debt ballooned to $6 billion.</v>

457
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.741
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

458
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it's still owed $19 billion to the Soviet Union.</v>

459
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.940
<v Speaker 1>The Soviets trying to help by increasing trade with the fall of the Soviet</v>

460
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:27.941
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

461
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:30.400
<v Speaker 1>In 1989 all the agreements fell apart.</v>

462
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.580
<v Speaker 1>The already week you've been economy was severely restricted.</v>

463
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Strict to rationing was put in place.</v>

464
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.790
<v Speaker 1>The electricity supply became sporadic and tractors were replaced with ox drawn</v>

465
00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:42.340
<v Speaker 1>carts where there's country on the brink of collapse.</v>

466
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.240
<v Speaker 1>In 1993 Castro Cubans to start private businesses.</v>

467
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:46.970
<v Speaker 1>The following year,</v>

468
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>he permitted foreign investors to own given businesses as well.</v>

469
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 1>If the economy which had declined by 40% in the past three years,</v>

470
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 1>finally began to grow.</v>

471
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 1>By the 1990s castrate was an aging isolators and largely depressed dictator.</v>

472
00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.150
<v Speaker 1>The majority of his close associates were either dead or had been exiled.</v>

473
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.570
<v Speaker 1>He still keeps up his habit of staying in one place for any two or three nights,</v>

474
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.350
<v Speaker 1>so he was constantly being moved around and a bulletproof Mercedes limousine</v>

475
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.900
<v Speaker 1>during this period of Castro's tight grip on the country seems to loosen</v>

476
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.460
<v Speaker 1>slightly,</v>

477
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.390
<v Speaker 1>but then in March of 2003 he imposed a crackdown,</v>

478
00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.200
<v Speaker 1>which Sol scores of journalists,</v>

479
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.950
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

480
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and professional people arrested us dissidents of the regime.</v>

481
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.450
<v Speaker 1>In July of 2006 the 80 year old Castro underwent surgery for internal bleeding.</v>

482
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.410
<v Speaker 1>The following year he handed over the presidential rents to his brother Raul.</v>

483
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.230
<v Speaker 1>From then Fidelis health grants relate to Terrie right it.</v>

484
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.910
<v Speaker 1>The ends finally came on November the 26th of 2016 though the exact cause of his</v>

485
00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:51.320
<v Speaker 1>death was never released.</v>

486
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.320
<v Speaker 1>The country was in mourning for nine days.</v>
