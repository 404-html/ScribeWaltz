1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He was the richest man in America.</v>

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>The world at his fingertips bans,</v>

3
00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:05.451
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

4
00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>he was a prisoner to his own dark fears.</v>

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>His achievements were astounding.</v>

6
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>He created the fastest plane on the planet,</v>

7
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>was the driving force behind the largest aircraft ever built and was a pioneer</v>

8
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>in film making,</v>

9
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>and yet he is remembered for the eccentricities that drove him from hero to</v>

10
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>harness in his heyday.</v>

11
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>He was a romantic figure with movie style.</v>

12
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It's blocking to be seen on his own,</v>

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>and yet he spent the last 26 years of his life as a recluse,</v>

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with cleanliness and controlling every aspect of his environment.</v>

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Even as he sunk deeper and deeper into madness and this biographics episode,</v>

16
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.481
<v Speaker 1>we entered these strange worlds of the original eccentric billionaire Howard</v>

17
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.983
<v Speaker 1>Hughes.</v>

18
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to the life of Howard Hughes,</v>

19
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>it can be a challenge to separate fact from fiction.</v>

20
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Even the details of his birth were falsified.</v>

21
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Official records give that date as December the 24th,</v>

22
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.451
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

23
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>85 in Houston,</v>

24
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

25
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that it had been born two months earlier in the oil town of</v>

26
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>humble,</v>

27
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>100 miles from Texas,</v>

28
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>from there for you as well.</v>

29
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>They just built upon each other and he was not one of triplets,</v>

30
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>nor was his mother's sisters,</v>

31
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>illegitimate son or a substance user baby brought in to replace the one who had</v>

32
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

33
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.580
<v Speaker 1>All these fanciful stories were later told by the man himself in order to build</v>

34
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>upon the aura that surrounded his name,</v>

35
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you senior known as both a shortened form of his middle name.</v>

36
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Roberts had been a penniless scoundrel bombing his way around Joplin,</v>

37
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Missouri at the turn of the 19th century in 18,</v>

38
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>

39
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>He was running out of the town by the furious father of a girl who he tried to</v>

40
00:01:55.521 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>seduce with no other options that dreamy eyed laracon decided to try his hand at</v>

41
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>the oil business,</v>

42
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>making his way to Texas,</v>

43
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>but just happened to be on hands when he thousand foot spume of black oil itself</v>

44
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>from the grounds at spindletop on January the 10th of 19.</v>

45
00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh one.</v>

46
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>He was among the first to grab claims,</v>

47
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>buying our plans for a few dollars and Acre and selling it only days later,</v>

48
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of dollars within a few months,</v>

49
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>having amassed a small fortune boom.</v>

50
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Moved to Houston where he found it.</v>

51
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:25.610
<v Speaker 1>The Texas oil fuel company,</v>

52
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.460
<v Speaker 1>vf four runner to tax code within six months.</v>

53
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:33.461
<v Speaker 1>He had also married the darkly prettier but seriously hypochondriacal Ilene</v>

54
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Garner,</v>

55
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Eileen.</v>

56
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>She was terrified of small animals and had an insect phobio fueled by an</v>

57
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 1>obsession with cleanliness via straights.</v>

58
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:41.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>they were defined full expression in her son by the time that Howard junior</v>

60
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:46.401
<v Speaker 1>known as sunny,</v>

61
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>entered the world in 19 Oh,</v>

62
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

63
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>His father was still chasing oil still.</v>

64
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>He was frustrated not so much as finding the oil locations,</v>

65
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>but at the inferior quality of the drilling tools that were available.</v>

66
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

67
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>out the exasperations,</v>

68
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.120
<v Speaker 1>he set his sights on designing a better drill bit.</v>

69
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>On November the 20th,</v>

70
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:09.241
<v Speaker 1>1,980 emerged from his study with designs for a bis the contained to 168 cutting</v>

71
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>edges.</v>

72
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>He had just invented the Hughes tool,</v>

73
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>this from which would flow the millions of dollars,</v>

74
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 1>which would both enrich and ultimately destroy his son App by the age of four.</v>

75
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious that sunny hughes had inherited the partial deafness that run in</v>

76
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

77
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>the condition it will become progressively worse over Howard's lifetime.</v>

78
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.331
<v Speaker 1>As a youngster,</v>

79
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>he had caused him to become isolated and introspective.</v>

80
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Now that money was no object,</v>

81
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>so the eight year olds cues was sent to an exclusive private school.</v>

82
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>He didn't make a very good impression though with a head teacher remembering him</v>

83
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 1>as an upper to snobbish and bore who refuse to join in with the other boys</v>

84
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>preferring to sit with the girls.</v>

85
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly,</v>

86
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>he seemed gains a reputation as a sissy,</v>

87
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>but the young Hughes,</v>

88
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>he also gained a reputation as a technical whiz kids.</v>

89
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>He put together his first wireless radio transmitter when he was only 11 years</v>

90
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

91
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.431
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>

92
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>his picture appeared in the local newspaper,</v>

93
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>proudly standing next to the first and motorized bicycle and Houston,</v>

94
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>which he had put together from a steam engine and an effort to get his nervous</v>

95
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and timid boy to man up.</v>

96
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Boy decided to pack him off to camp over the day,</v>

97
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 1>which was the boy scouts.</v>

98
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>So during the 1916 summer recess suddenly found himself in the middle of the</v>

99
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] mountains in Pike County,</v>

100
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>

101
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>He was under the tutelage of a grizzled old timer by the name of General Dan</v>

102
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Beard.</v>

103
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.161
<v Speaker 1>Surprisingly,</v>

104
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.150
<v Speaker 1>the young Hughes he took to the woodsmen life,</v>

105
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>lengthy proverbial duck to water.</v>

106
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It was already quite quickly,</v>

107
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>learn to whistle effects Indian signs and simulate bird calls.</v>

108
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to excel under the military discipline of the camp to away from the</v>

109
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>over protective of his mother.</v>

110
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:53.971
<v Speaker 1>It seemed he was able to shake off his feminine nature and show his true colors.</v>

111
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>In the fall of 1920,</v>

112
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.020
<v Speaker 1>a 14 year old son,</v>

113
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>he went with his father to v Harvard,</v>

114
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Yale and rowing crew races in Connecticut.</v>

115
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.030
<v Speaker 1>He's seen me,</v>

116
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I promise to buy his son.</v>

117
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Whatever he wanted,</v>

118
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.320
<v Speaker 1>if it's favorite,</v>

119
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Harvard won that race,</v>

120
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>went Harvard,</v>

121
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>smashed Yale.</v>

122
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>By 14 seconds.</v>

123
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>The boy held out his hand and expectation and asked for $5.</v>

124
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>He then pointed to a selling further up the rhythm.</v>

125
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Advertising rides on a flying boat for $5.</v>

126
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Do Senior reluctantly joined his son for the 10 minute flight.</v>

127
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It made the for the sick,</v>

128
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>but the sun had just discovered the one true love of his life.</v>

129
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>You found the experience of flying both exhilarating and liberating from that</v>

130
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>moment on,</v>

131
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>he would be asking is most peaceful when he was alone in an airplane flying high</v>

132
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>above a wells.</v>

133
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>The tea so often tried to escape</v>

134
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>by the age of 19.</v>

135
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Both of his parents were dead.</v>

136
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>His mother had died suddenly when he was 16 off suffering complications from an</v>

137
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>ectopic pregnancy died less than two years later,</v>

138
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>have a heart attack leaving Hughes Jr.</v>

139
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>The ad of the hughes tool company.</v>

140
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>He dropped ouT of college to take control of the company quickly.</v>

141
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>discovering that he knew nothing about the oil business.</v>

142
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>He seemed hired a self taught accountants buying the name of tHem.</v>

143
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Though a direct to take feed controls at the same time he was legally declared</v>

144
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>himself an adult and seized full control of the entire family.</v>

145
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

146
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>here's now had the money that he needed to pursue his greatest passions.</v>

147
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Those passions well,</v>

148
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>they had nothing to do with oil.</v>

149
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Instead they revolved around building and flying airplanes and also making</v>

150
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>movies in hollywood and other of his passions was actually gulf.</v>

151
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>one's a while playing at the beverly hills country club.</v>

153
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>He wants.</v>

154
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>She's a biplane,</v>

155
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.930
<v Speaker 1>flew overhead and tipped his wing.</v>

156
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Tanner howard was able to track down to fly and offered to pay him the</v>

157
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 1>outrageous sum of $800 per day if he would teach them to find the probably well</v>

158
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>the readily agreed in two years later he was was issued his private pilot's</v>

159
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.724
<v Speaker 1>license.</v>

160
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like just cHronic shyness.</v>

161
00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Howard was fascinated with the glitz and glamor of hollywood in order to break</v>

162
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:06.300
<v Speaker 1>into the business.</v>

163
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 1>He's signed a talented director,</v>

164
00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:10.830
<v Speaker 1>lewis milestone to a three year contract.</v>

165
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.630
<v Speaker 1>The pairing thing immediately struck gold with their debut picture to arabian</v>

166
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:18.540
<v Speaker 1>nights claiming and academy award in 1927.</v>

167
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.020
<v Speaker 1>This gave us the confidence to take on his next challenge,</v>

168
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.220
<v Speaker 1>a fusion of his two great loves flying and movies,</v>

169
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.771
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>

170
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 1>defining the director who shared his passion for the skies.</v>

171
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Howard decided to go to loan writing,</v>

172
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 1>producing and directing the world's first true aviation picture.</v>

173
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 1>It was called hell's angels.</v>

174
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.920
<v Speaker 1>this was going to be his magnum opus,</v>

175
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.860
<v Speaker 1>and he was prepared to pour in as much money,</v>

176
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.670
<v Speaker 1>time and effort as was needed to create this masterpiece.</v>

177
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 1>An athlete who was contracted that was bigger than that of some countries during</v>

178
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.370
<v Speaker 1>aerial filming sequences.</v>

179
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Howard's obsessive compulsion led him to fixate on such things as cloud</v>

180
00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:58.644
<v Speaker 1>formations.</v>

181
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 1>He would scrap a valuable minutes of perfectly good footage forcing his pilots</v>

182
00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:05.490
<v Speaker 1>to reshoot until the clouds would just for ryan</v>

183
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>one day cubes in an effort to control every aspect of an aerial shoots.</v>

184
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.220
<v Speaker 1>He went and taught in a small plane,</v>

185
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 1>but no sooner had he centered than the plane went into a tailspin and crashed</v>

186
00:08:21.871 --> 00:08:22.704
<v Speaker 1>into the ground.</v>

187
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Howard's managed to walk away uninjured.</v>

188
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.100
<v Speaker 1>The first of a number of miraculous plane crash escapes start that actually</v>

189
00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:29.581
<v Speaker 1>commented,</v>

190
00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:32.490
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't injured his check writing.</v>

191
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Speaker 1>so how is obsession with perfection that men's,</v>

193
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the shooting schedule for hell's angels got totally out of control.</v>

194
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.511
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>

195
00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:44.490
<v Speaker 1>the public had become infatuated with the latest hollywood innovation talkies</v>

196
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.500
<v Speaker 1>against everyone's advice.</v>

197
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's decided to do rescripts in the movie and reshoot all of the dialogue</v>

198
00:08:50.371 --> 00:08:51.060
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

199
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.800
<v Speaker 1>This time adding sound.</v>

200
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.650
<v Speaker 1>The reshoots proved to be the break of a for reform and pits plan named holly</v>

201
00:08:57.651 --> 00:08:58.484
<v Speaker 1>and compensate.</v>

202
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>The leading lady of the movie reads a nissen wiscosh because of the strong</v>

203
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>norwegian accent and carpenters stepped into the role,</v>

204
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>he was transformed her into jean harlow,</v>

205
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>the platinum blonde bombshell.</v>

206
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>He became a sensation during the 19 thirties hell's angels.</v>

207
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a box office mash,</v>

208
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 1>returning double its production cost.</v>

209
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 1>$4,000,000,</v>

210
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>which was an exorbitant announced at that time.</v>

211
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for us,</v>

212
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.711
<v Speaker 1>three movies,</v>

213
00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:22.544
<v Speaker 1>flops followed.</v>

214
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>They've managed to cash in on the public's obsession with al capone by producing</v>

215
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the movie scarface.</v>

216
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 1>We've actually got a biographics video on him as well.</v>

217
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You can find it in a link in the description below.</v>

218
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.691
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

219
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:34.171
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>

220
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:34.951
<v Speaker 1>where's one of these guys?</v>

221
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>He always wanted to push the boundaries and films this movie with all of the</v>

222
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 1>violence and all of the absurdities that you'd imagined would be associated with</v>

223
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:43.044
<v Speaker 1>al capone.</v>

224
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Not surprisingly,</v>

225
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 1>the sensors knocks it back,</v>

226
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>the moms in major edits to the movie,</v>

227
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>and so that surprise hughes sued them and won.</v>

228
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 1>The theme would be released just as as it intended for.</v>

229
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of scarface.</v>

230
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.111
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

231
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:05.944
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

232
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.220
<v Speaker 1>His lust for power.</v>

233
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.113
<v Speaker 1>Fancy women.</v>

234
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.360
<v Speaker 2>No work too hard.</v>

235
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I just finish up tonight,</v>

236
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 1>so after the release of scarface,</v>

237
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:21.700
<v Speaker 1>hughes decided to step back from hollywood's too indulgent is other great</v>

238
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:24.130
<v Speaker 1>passion and that of course was flying</v>

239
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.840
<v Speaker 1>in 1934.</v>

240
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.150
<v Speaker 1>He easily won a flying race in miami.</v>

241
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.280
<v Speaker 1>This success fueled his ambitions,</v>

242
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>inspiring him to set up the hughes aircraft.</v>

243
00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Company emails set helped to design and build for wells false desk racing plane.</v>

244
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.820
<v Speaker 1>The results of all of his efforts was the h one which used to a new world speed</v>

245
00:10:49.821 --> 00:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>

246
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred 52 miles per hour on august the 18th of 1935 by 1938.</v>

247
00:10:55.761 --> 00:10:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Hughes was intends on achieving another wells fest.</v>

248
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>The fastest flight around the welds and the modified lockied 14 and he took to</v>

249
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:08.531
<v Speaker 1>the skies with a handpicked crew and set off from New York 16 hours and 38</v>

250
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:14.111
<v Speaker 1>minutes later they landed in paris to moscow and then area three days,</v>

251
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.880
<v Speaker 1>19 hours and 14 minutes after setting out.</v>

252
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.710
<v Speaker 1>They were back in New York.</v>

253
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.240
<v Speaker 1>He was hailed as a conquering hero in for three days the pink for these shiny</v>

254
00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:24.500
<v Speaker 1>adventurer in dod,</v>

255
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 1>ticker tape parades and receptions in New York,</v>

256
00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:27.800
<v Speaker 1>chicago,</v>

257
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Washington,</v>

258
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.360
<v Speaker 1>and houston.</v>

259
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.201
<v Speaker 1>In 1940,</v>

260
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:34.190
<v Speaker 1>he was moved into commercial aviation blind grabbing a controlling share of</v>

261
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.130
<v Speaker 1>trans world airlines or two,</v>

262
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.750
<v Speaker 1>a short time later,</v>

263
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.340
<v Speaker 1>the us government cooling.</v>

264
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.130
<v Speaker 1>They wanted hughes aircraft do supply plain bod salt,</v>

265
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.000
<v Speaker 1>hillary shells and cannon barrels to help support the war effort in europe.</v>

266
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later with America well anD truly immersed in the conflicts.</v>

267
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Hughes was contracted to design,</v>

268
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 1>build a massive flying boats in order to overcome the german u boat menace that</v>

269
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>was causing serious problems for us transport vessels.</v>

270
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So while doing the testing and design for these projects,</v>

271
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 1>hughes was involved in his fourth plane crash.</v>

272
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>He was testing a sikorsky as 43 amphibian aircraft on the lake mead,</v>

273
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>

274
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.420
<v Speaker 1>The plane went down into the frigid waters and it actually killed a ca inspector</v>

275
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.720
<v Speaker 1>and an engineer who will also on board the vessel hughes.</v>

276
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.401
<v Speaker 1>He wants again,</v>

277
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>managed to walk away or that you did receive a large gash to the top.</v>

278
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.430
<v Speaker 1>it was around this time that hughes began to exhibit patterns of behavior that</v>

279
00:12:37.431 --> 00:12:39.240
<v Speaker 1>seems odd to you only look,</v>

280
00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:42.170
<v Speaker 1>it's compulsive handwashing to avoid germs,</v>

281
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.440
<v Speaker 1>checking and rechecking his work and always thinking cemetery,</v>

282
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.450
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to make things perfect.</v>

283
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.370
<v Speaker 1>All classic signs of ocd.</v>

284
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.640
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing symptoms of a deteriorating mind.</v>

285
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>This was hardly a good time for whispers of insanity with his business empire,</v>

286
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.220
<v Speaker 1>rapidly expanding it as business contracts imposing wheezy demands.</v>

287
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Hughes was facing stresses and pressures from all directions to huge contracts</v>

288
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:07.830
<v Speaker 1>for the xf.</v>

289
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Eleven reconnaissance,</v>

290
00:13:08.781 --> 00:13:13.610
<v Speaker 1>blaine and the h k one spruce goose were both over budget and they were overdue.</v>

291
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Most of the deletes that would do to hughes hughes's incessant tinkering and his</v>

292
00:13:17.841 --> 00:13:22.160
<v Speaker 1>insistence on being the test pilot for both planes and well.</v>

293
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.930
<v Speaker 1>There was this insistence which brought about his closest color,</v>

294
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 1>yet on july the seventh,</v>

295
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:27.921
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

296
00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:28.850
<v Speaker 1>46 years,</v>

297
00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:33.851
<v Speaker 1>took the xf 11 for its first ever test flights over the los angeles basin.</v>

298
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Now for the first 45 minutes,</v>

299
00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:37.910
<v Speaker 1>this plane functioned perfectly.</v>

300
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly a propeller malfunction caused the plane to plummet to the ground,</v>

301
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.130
<v Speaker 1>desperately wrestling with the controls hughes hope to land on a fairway at the</v>

302
00:13:46.131 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 1>los angeles country club in stats,</v>

303
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.230
<v Speaker 1>the plunge through the roof of a nearby house.</v>

304
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.980
<v Speaker 1>this it was one crash that hughes he wasn't able to walk away from.</v>

305
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.820
<v Speaker 1>It was extracted from the record as it went up in flames and rushed to the</v>

306
00:13:58.821 --> 00:13:59.450
<v Speaker 1>hospital</v>

307
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.000
<v Speaker 3>after ripping the corner from two homes in beverly hills,</v>

308
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:02.834
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

309
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.210
<v Speaker 3>The plane finally plunged into this house.</v>

310
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.530
<v Speaker 3>The force of the impact virtually wrecked the building and caused the plane to</v>

311
00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:10.364
<v Speaker 3>catch fire.</v>

312
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.840
<v Speaker 1>He suffered severe head trauma and ben's multiple buttons along with fractures</v>

313
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>to his neck.</v>

314
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 1>These injuries that were going to cause him to suffering for the rest of his</v>

315
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.700
<v Speaker 1>life to control his pain.</v>

316
00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Hughes sTarted taking a lot of drugs and you relied on a three part cocktail of</v>

317
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

318
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.480
<v Speaker 1>coding,</v>

319
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>valium and emperor emirates.</v>

320
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.520
<v Speaker 1>These are drugs that he took daily for the next 30 years.</v>

321
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Still the pain and head injuries.</v>

322
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>They affected his behavior,</v>

323
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 1>causing his ocd to spin out of control</v>

324
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.440
<v Speaker 1>long before his addiction to painkillers.</v>

325
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.191
<v Speaker 1>How would he use?</v>

326
00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

327
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.110
<v Speaker 1>he has another addiction.</v>

328
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

329
00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.700
<v Speaker 1>That was to winning.</v>

330
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.160
<v Speaker 1>When he came to hollywood in 1925,</v>

331
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.370
<v Speaker 1>he had a wife and an enormous sexual appetite.</v>

332
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.580
<v Speaker 1>The wife balance.</v>

333
00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>You'd tine of his infidelities filing for divorce in 1929.</v>

334
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.520
<v Speaker 1>The sexual appetite very well.</v>

335
00:15:11.521 --> 00:15:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It remains end.</v>

336
00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Was satisfied with a list of hollywood conquests that would include such stars</v>

337
00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:18.330
<v Speaker 1>as peter's rita hayworth,</v>

338

<v Speaker 1>and katharine hepburn.</v>

341
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.260
<v Speaker 1>He is well.</v>

342
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.950
<v Speaker 1>He was obsessed with the female form and this was actually the inspiration for</v>

343
00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.570
<v Speaker 1>his most controversial film.</v>

344
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.520
<v Speaker 1>The outlaw said during the old west,</v>

345
00:15:29.521 --> 00:15:33.900
<v Speaker 1>the movie was a showcase for the voluptuous Jane Russell with he used personally</v>

346
00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:38.310
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that addresses where were low enough to accentuate her size.</v>

<v Speaker 1>30 eight bus.</v>

348
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.201
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

349
00:15:40.201 --> 00:15:43.020
<v Speaker 1>these centers were outraged but hughes realm,</v>

350
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.140
<v Speaker 1>he was laughing all the way to the bank by the mid 19 forties.</v>

351
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Here's his health issues were impacting upon his increasingly complicated</v>

352
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.360
<v Speaker 1>business empire.</v>

353
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.400
<v Speaker 1>In addition to his ownership of two,</v>

354
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.690
<v Speaker 1>the hughes tool company.</v>

355
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 1>He now also owns the rko movie studio.</v>

356
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.561
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

357
00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:03.420
<v Speaker 1>he was building a huge aerospace company to develop technology for the military</v>

358
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.440
<v Speaker 1>in 1947.</v>

359
00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:07.530
<v Speaker 1>The pressure on here's what is ramped up several notches when he was subpoenaed</v>

360
00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:11.820
<v Speaker 1>to appear before congress regarding alleged improprieties in his government</v>

361
00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 1>contracts in a commanding performance with the dv cameras rolling.</v>

362
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.390
<v Speaker 1>He strongly denied profiteering from the war effort.</v>

363
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.733
<v Speaker 4>What</v>

364
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.953
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

365
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.833
<v Speaker 4>that</v>

366
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.400
<v Speaker 1>it is sort of like running for this congressional appearance is most confident,</v>

367
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.630
<v Speaker 1>strong and dominant.</v>

368
00:16:33.631 --> 00:16:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Public outing was also the last time that the public would see howard hughes.</v>

369
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.480
<v Speaker 1>The brilliance fearless,</v>

370
00:16:39.481 --> 00:16:40.560
<v Speaker 1>visible millionaire.</v>

371
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

372
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.650
<v Speaker 1>he was transforming into a mysterious invisible.</v>

373
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.940
<v Speaker 1>A 53 year old use was now completely intense on retreating from society for</v>

374
00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:57.451
<v Speaker 1>symptoms.</v>

375
00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:00.270
<v Speaker 1>If it's undiagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder,</v>

376
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.190
<v Speaker 1>where buying now or to a parent,</v>

377
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.860
<v Speaker 1>it refused to shake hands or touch door handles.</v>

378
00:17:04.861 --> 00:17:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Instructions to his aides were repeated in meticulous detail and he flew into</v>

379
00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:13.170
<v Speaker 1>violent regions when things were not exactly as he had commanded,</v>

380
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.860
<v Speaker 1>those who worked for hughes began calling him the old man and they became</v>

381
00:17:16.861 --> 00:17:21.360
<v Speaker 1>seriously concerns that he was going and seeing the fbi who are actually keeping</v>

382
00:17:21.361 --> 00:17:26.361
<v Speaker 1>tabs on him noted in 1950 7:15 was the acting like inscrutable paranoiac they</v>

383
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:26.971
<v Speaker 1>added,</v>

384
00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:30.930
<v Speaker 1>but it could even be capable of murder then seemingly totally out of the blue.</v>

385
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:34.380
<v Speaker 1>He was declared to that he was going to marry one of the many stylists that he</v>

386
00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:35.214
<v Speaker 1>had been seeing.</v>

387
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Jean pinches.</v>

388
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Many people believe that hughes decided to get hitched so that his aides would</v>

389
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:44.640
<v Speaker 1>no longer be able to have him committed to an asylum less than a year after</v>

390
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.050
<v Speaker 1>marrying peter's in Nevada motel room hughes descended into one of the most</v>

391
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 1>episodes of his life.</v>

392
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.730
<v Speaker 1>He told his aides that he wanted to view some movie.</v>

393
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it a studio on sunset boulevard?</v>

394
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 1>He didn't leave that dark and screening room for more than four months.</v>

395
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 5>You used to open the bag with his right hand and hold the bag out to me at a 45</v>

396
00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:07.041
<v Speaker 5>degree angle,</v>

397
00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:09.650
<v Speaker 5>so I reached into the bag without,</v>

398
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.670
<v Speaker 5>without touching the paper.</v>

399
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.200
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

400
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.550
<v Speaker 1>his diet consisted of chocolate bars and milk,</v>

401
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and he spent his days and nights sitting naked in a chair staring at the screen.</v>

402
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.191
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

403
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.540
<v Speaker 1>he was communicated with his aide,</v>

404
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.340
<v Speaker 1>spike scribbling on a yellow legal pad.</v>

405
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Instructions until you did not looking at him speaking to him unless spoken to</v>

406
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.040
<v Speaker 1>you first.</v>

407
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Over those four months of the studio,</v>

408
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.490
<v Speaker 1>his personal hygiene net rapidly deteriorated even as his german obsession</v>

409
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:44.330
<v Speaker 1>intensifies.</v>

410
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.440
<v Speaker 1>When he finally emerged from the screening room in the spring of 1958,</v>

411
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.910
<v Speaker 1>he was was an unkempt,</v>

412
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.810
<v Speaker 1>ragged sentence,</v>

413
00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:51.890
<v Speaker 1>pathetic mess.</v>

414
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.551
<v Speaker 1>Following this,</v>

415
00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:54.790
<v Speaker 1>he pretty much immediately checked into the beverly hills.</v>

416
00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I tell them another place,</v>

417
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll only space to stay on a temporary basis,</v>

418
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but he was ended up staying in that for years.</v>

419
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

420
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.080
<v Speaker 1>He reverted to his screening room habits sitting naked in the dark hour after</v>

421
00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:09.590
<v Speaker 1>our business dealings were conducted by telephone and through his handwritten</v>

422
00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:11.120
<v Speaker 1>instructions during this time,</v>

423
00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:14.480
<v Speaker 1>his drug use also escalated as he fought continuous pain.</v>

424
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Now injecting himself with morphine to supplement his megadoses of coding and</v>

425
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:19.820
<v Speaker 1>valium.</v>

426
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 1>In 1966,</v>

427
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:23.450
<v Speaker 1>conducting negotiations completely by telephone.</v>

428
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Hughes sold his controlling sham in two eight.</v>

429
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.430
<v Speaker 1>This made him a billionaire,</v>

430
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.620
<v Speaker 1>the richest man in America,</v>

431
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but rather than simply syphilis.</v>

432
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Fortune hughes disliked is pathetic.</v>

433
00:19:34.191 --> 00:19:39.191
<v Speaker 1>Physical condition set his sights on conquering a brand new frontier and that</v>

434
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.130
<v Speaker 1>front here,</v>

435
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.671
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

436
00:19:40.671 --> 00:19:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Las vegas.</v>

437
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

438
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.540
<v Speaker 1>His first move was to relocate to the penthouse suite of the deserts in where he</v>

439
00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:53.840
<v Speaker 1>could continue his bizarre lifestyle without interruption.</v>

440
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.390
<v Speaker 1>He then began buying up the city,</v>

441
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.190
<v Speaker 1>starting with the hotel that he was living in.</v>

442
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.090
<v Speaker 1>His investments included the local tv station which he bought so that he could</v>

443
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:04.910
<v Speaker 1>demand they play the movies that he wanted to watch.</v>

444
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Now by 1970,</v>

445
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.300
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

446
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.290
<v Speaker 1>He was a prisoner of his own design and then as if things weren't crazy enough</v>

447
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:18.860
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

448
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.440
<v Speaker 1>he suddenly left the desert in without warning.</v>

449
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Many in his entourage,</v>

450
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>they thought that it had been adopted.</v>

451
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Three weeks later,</v>

452
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.110
<v Speaker 1>he turns up in The Bahamas.</v>

453
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.200
<v Speaker 1>From that he announced that he was turning the day to day operations of his</v>

454
00:20:30.201 --> 00:20:33.080
<v Speaker 1>empire over to a group of mormon aids.</v>

455
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.250
<v Speaker 1>In 1972,</v>

456
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.950
<v Speaker 1>he was relocated to a hotel room in london.</v>

457
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.710
<v Speaker 1>He left the room only once to go flying.</v>

458
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.370
<v Speaker 1>that's this was like no flight here had ever taken before.</v>

459
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Planning into the cockpit seat took off all of his claim in the sand to around</v>

460
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 1>in london,</v>

461
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 1>in the nude.</v>

462
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Following what would be his final flight at the helm,</v>

463
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.400
<v Speaker 1>hughes's condition.</v>

464
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

465
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it rapidly deteriorated.</v>

466
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.410
<v Speaker 1>He took a Fall in as london hotel room,</v>

467
00:20:56.411 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 1>which increased his reliance on painkillers and unfortunately took away his</v>

468
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.370
<v Speaker 1>ability to work.</v>

469
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.553
<v Speaker 1>Things swelled.</v>

470
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.120
<v Speaker 1>They only went downhill from here is if by design uses last hours were spent in</v>

471
00:21:15.121 --> 00:21:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the app.</v>

472
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.960
<v Speaker 1>It was traveling to houston to receive medical treatments is an anticipated</v>

473
00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:19.261
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

474
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Finally breathed his last breath on april the fifth,</v>

475
00:21:21.991 --> 00:21:23.580
<v Speaker 1>1976 so well,</v>

476
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.120
<v Speaker 1>and it was shocked when the autopsy pictures revealed the terrible condition of</v>

477
00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

478
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.390
<v Speaker 1>The results of undiagnosed or cd,</v>

479
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.220
<v Speaker 1>multiple severe head injuries and 30 years have largely selfimposed neglect.</v>

480
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.360
<v Speaker 1>It was so sad.</v>

481
00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:38.440
<v Speaker 1>End for a truly brilliant man.</v>

482
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.920
