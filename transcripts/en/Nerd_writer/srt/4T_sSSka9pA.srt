1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,073
It's impossible to imagine the long 
awaited sequel to blade runner without 

2
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:12,730
some version of the iconic music that 
Vangelis composed for the original.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,230
That's because the blade runner score is
more than a score.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,630
It's an indispensable element of the 
movie.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,733
I mean,
you could make that argument about 

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,730
almost all film music of movie minus 
it's music.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,680
It's not the same movie and,
and that's true too.

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,840
If you were to swap one kind of music,

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,063
nothing

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,093
in the video I did on Howard shores,
incredible light motifs in the Lord of 

11
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:43,574
the rings.
I tried to show how the score helped 

12
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:47,840
guide and elevate the emotional beats of
the story.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,920
It's great work from a great composer 
and hugely influential on the trilogy.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,920
I think blade runner's music is 
different.

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,843
It plays a different role.
The score isn't laid on top of the 

16
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:01,130
visuals.
It's not a guide or an addition.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,480
The music is sort of baked into the DNA 
of the movie itself.

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,180
All the audio that you hear including 
score,

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,110
sound,
design,

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,540
dialog,
it's tightly integrated.

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,403
Each blurs into the others.
Creation is really what separates blade 

22
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:23,820
runner from other science fiction films.
After all,

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,713
electronic music had been a staple of 
science fiction cinema for three 

24
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:28,524
decades.
By then going all the way back to 

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,200
Bernard Herman's use of the therapy in 
the day the earth stood still herman,

26
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:38,550
another revolutionary composers like 
Lewis and Bebe Barron used winding,

27
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:39,870
bending,
sputtering,

28
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,930
electronic sounds to evoke aliens and 
alien planets.

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,643
Renner is somewhere in the middle 
between the a melodic soundscapes of 

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,273
forbidden planet and the grand symphonic
themes of something like star wars and 

31
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:58,270
they gave us is pulling from that same 
toolbox of electronic sounds,

32
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:02,500
but these noises are put to use for a 
more musical purpose in order to achieve

33
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,630
that dream like quality that the film 
has.

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,773
The audience shouldn't be able to 
identify where the music ends and the 

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,993
World

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,583
Ms Dot lyrics that infused this scene or
a good example of what I'm talking 

37
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,674
about.
They sound a little bit like wind 

38
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,430
chimes.
Something that could very well be in the

39
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:25,170
space and match pretty well with the 
dancing.

40
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:28,770
The light on the walls and you have the 
sound is so layered with faint computery

41
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,410
noises that it could also be a machine 
somewhere in the room.

42
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,783
It also serves as a kind of atmosphere 
at bed from which the clearly 

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,550
nondiabetic not in the world.
Strings rise as Rachel enter

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,340
like even the dialogue has a lot of 
reverb giving it the same dreamy quality

45
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,560
as the score and the sound effects.
Becker,

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,963
of course,
reverberation is absolutely everywhere 

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,270
in blade runner.
You could even say that.

48
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:01,390
It's the manipulation of reverb that 
gives blade runner it's distinct feeling

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,240
and the Vandellas is such a virtuoso at 
wielding it.

50
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,103
The digital reverb that you hear in this
movie was something relatively new to 

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,854
music at the time.
The world's first digital reverberation 

52
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,210
machine,
the emt to 50,

53
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,510
was released only six years before blade
runner premiered in 1982.

54
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,000
We all have a natural sense of river.
We hear it when we're in big spaces,

55
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,090
how our voice reverberates and decays 
across the room.

56
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,080
Digital reverb uses algorithms to extend
that decay even more.

57
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,183
The lexicon two to four,
which is what Vangelis used for blade 

58
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,960
runner,
could extend the up to 70 seconds,

59
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:38,470
allowing you to make spacey a theorial.
Sounds like this.

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,610
The emphasis on reverb accomplishes a 
few things.

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,580
As I say,
Andrew Stiller noted heavy river because

62
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:53,730
it implies a huge enclosed hard surface 
space,

63
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,564
creates a mood of mystery and paranoia,
and also it gives everything a feeling 

64
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,930
of distance as if the audio is coming 
from far away,

65
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,880
like in a dream.
Finally,

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,850
reverberation blends things together,
and this is one of the crucial ways main

67
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,684
Gellis fold separate audio sources into 
one oral master track because that is 

68
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,074
the goal here.
Every scene is composed to create this 

69
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:18,690
cohesive acoustic environment.
Sometimes the emphasis is on dialogue or

70
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,524
sound effects.
Other Times it's on the nostalgic music 

71
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,464
that calls back to classic film,
except that Solo Saxophone was never 

72
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,220
actually used in classic film noir,
which is a whole nother video,

73
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,054
but anyway,

74
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,620
most of these scenes were interpreted by
Ben Jealous on the spot.

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,450
The way he composed the music for blade 
runner,

76
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:40,284
it was by watching the freshly edited 
scenes on a screen in his studio and 

77
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:44,304
playing whatever they evoked in him at 
the time it used primarily the Yamaha 

78
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:48,024
cs,
csad and analog synthesizer featured so 

79
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:50,784
prominently in blade runner that bank 
ellis has his own section in the CSAD 

80
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,100
wikipedia page.
Even today,

81
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:56,934
the CSAD is prized among audio files.
It seems like anybody who ever writes 

82
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:01,074
about it describes it as a living,
breathing thing that's partly down to 

83
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,840
the fact that the keys were pressure 
sensitive,

84
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:11,250
so the sound that it produced as a 
marvelous acoustic quality in a way,

85
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,200
it's the perfect instrument for blade 
runner,

86
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,610
a machine with the ability to match the 
emotional weight of the real thing

87
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,713
in in one in one goal.
You can have from that to that to that 

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,240
which is which different,
again,

89
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,640
as much as possible,
Vangelis used his spontaneous first take

90
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:51,900
compositions and the result is a deeply 
personal reaction to the images.

91
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:52,734
A second vision that fuses with the 
director's own is the great composer Ed 

92
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,623
Guard before him attempted to bring to 
life the complete sound profile of the 

93
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,994
city,
interpreted through the genres of blade 

94
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,174
runner.
Anybody who's lived in a large 

95
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:09,170
metropolis knows that sound is a 
constant feature there.

96
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,190
At night you might hear a siren or a 
scream somewhere in the distance.

97
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,980
We may not have wheezing or sputtering 
machines,

98
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,390
but these days we sure have a lot of 
beeping ones vein Bella strings,

99
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,224
all these disparate noises together with
musical themes that are stunning and 

100
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,840
appropriate.
When the music swirls,

101
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,693
it says,
if it's coming from within the 

102
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:31,940
characters themselves,
like an internal cry or a release,

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,220
jelly evangelists isn't coming back.
For Blade runner,

104
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,031
20,
49,

105
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,864
his job is going to Johan Johansson,
a great composer who's worked with 

106
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:52,030
director Denise Villeneuve three times 
before.

107
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,523
I don't envy him.
I mean everybody is going to be waiting 

108
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:57,310
for him to play someone else's iconic 
music.

109
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,893
If I were him,
I'd resist the urge to Mimic Vangelis 

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,713
completely.
As much as I'd like to hear every 

111
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,150
classic note.
Again,

112
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,410
the sql deserves music as personal and 
human as its original.

113
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,573
I'm excited to hear Johan Johansson is 
interpretation of a world that so many 

114
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,920
of us are so eager to return to

115
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,710
