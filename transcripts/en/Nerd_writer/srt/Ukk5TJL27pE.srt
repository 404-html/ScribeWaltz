1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,070
What did you do to me?
Your body won't last long in,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,260
stuck in there for the rest of your 
life.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,010
You'll get me out of here.
You son of up and down her cat.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,120
I hate cats.
Crappy movies suck.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,133
Obviously.
I hate to waste my money or my time on 

6
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,630
something that is truly bad like suicide
squad,

7
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:24,250
that where every decision seems to be 
made for maximum shit.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,760
He tells me a whole lot.
It's a shame,

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,773
but in the end,
I think crappy movies are an inevitable 

10
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:31,504
part of the cinematic ecosystem.
You're not ever going to get away from 

11
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,300
them and whether or not they make money,
some of which unfortunately do.

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,440
No one is setting out to make a movie 
that is a piece of crap.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm talking about a completely plus 
bottle

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,480
cough syrup.
That's like six bucks.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,110
What's more insidious in my opinion,
are movies that are just passable.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,630
Films just good enough not to be 
terrible.

17
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,490
I mean passable films,
they aren't bad.

18
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,324
They might even be better than okay,
but there are a far cry from great or 

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,103
noteworthy or something that you would 
like to see more than once that the 

20
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,440
cinematic equivalent of this image,
they don't fall apart,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,090
but their balance is always precarious.
In the last handful of years,

22
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:15,924
my annoyance with passable movies has 
steadily increased in proportion with 

23
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,920
their steadily increasing number.
Passable films like to multiply.

24
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:23,754
They do just enough for the audience and
just enough for the studio and just 

25
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:29,640
enough for the stars.
They have no problem being funded.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,593
Stop,
stop.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,790
I need to know what is happening right 
now.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,743
For a long time,
I've attributed the major problem with 

29
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,120
passable movies to a lack of tonal 
control.

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,800
The emotional logic of the narrative in 
films like these often often feels a bit

31
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,634
out of whack either.
The film tries to be too many things at 

32
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:49,110
once leading to unintended emotional 
confusion.

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,550
Don Friends as well,

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,960
Governor Nix this unit has been 
authorized,

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,440
is pristinely.
That's enough.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,390
That's enough

37
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,440
for the filmmakers.
Give characters traits that don't belong

38
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,690
to them in order to serve some plot 
function.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,200
What has it been this they're so fun to 
watch without the end?

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,333
Many millions of people with no what and
that's just the first two weeks of 

41
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,670
January or emotional arcs initiated 
early in the story are abandoned without

42
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,504
comment,
often proving in the end to be entirely 

43
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,490
pointless in good movies.
Everything points to everything else.

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,240
Emotional arcs of the characters,
the scenes,

45
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:44,074
the imagery,
the music and the plot are tightly 

46
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,990
entwined and this doesn't just go for 
high brow movies by the way,

47
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:50,824
whenever you hear someone say,
have a lower brow film that it knows 

48
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,634
what it is.
What they're really saying is that the 

49
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,034
film was totally focused,
but recently I've begun to notice 

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,190
another unifying feature of passable 
movies.

51
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,383
Indeed,
of all passable storytelling and to 

52
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,940
understand what I mean,
take a look at.

53
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,170
I gotta say feels really good to have 
somebody looking out for me.

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,600
I got your back.
I like that,

55
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,890
and I got your back too.
Hey Doug.

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
I like you man.
Thank you.

57
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,840
A great guy.
I just want you to remember that this is

58
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,660
a business relationship.
Doesn't mean that we're going to be best

59
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,494
friends.
That's not how this story is just an 

60
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,240
employee with a job to do.
I got it.

61
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,860
My best friend,
and you're just my best man.

62
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,620
It doesn't mean that we're not going to 
have a good time though I sat,

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,310
I got it.
You're anybody's best friend for price,

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,080
but nobody's winning account.

65
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,050
All the beats in the short scene should 
be familiar to us.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,370
We've seen them all before,
but there's something odd going on here.

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,473
See,
stories are almost always about people 

68
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,013
or aliens or gods or animals or robots 
that act like people and great stories 

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,250
are always the ones that observed people
truthfully,

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,473
the ones that capture human experience 
with nuance and insight and the best 

71
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:18,704
stories make such acute observations 
about humanity that they can show us 

72
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:25,400
things about ourselves that we didn't 
know or teach us how to articulate those

73
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:29,180
things against a vast unintelligible 
anxiety,

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,020
and this I think is the big difference 
between great movies and passable ones.

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,270
When passable movies observe human 
experience,

76
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,450
they observe it not through the lens of 
real life,

77
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,800
but through the lens of other movies.
Love is my life.

78
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,510
No love is your job.

79
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,543
No,
I think you're threatened by what zoe 

80
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,800
and I have because you're afraid I won't
be able to hang out every night.

81
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,240
You were my drug dealer.
There's one reason we know each other.

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,670
I like the drugs you sell.
That's it.

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,830
There is this huge library,
this huge vocabulary of actions built up

84
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:09,250
over the years that people you know 
don't really do,

85
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,203
but which happens so often in TV and 
movies that they're familiar enough to 

86
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:17,800
an audience that they become well 
passable for human motivations.

87
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,540
I'm not saying it's bad for filmmakers 
to site or pay homage to the movies that

88
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,374
they love in their own work.
I'm saying that too many films released 

89
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,364
today are being cobbled together from a 
weird alternate reality that is only a 

90
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:36,400
dim echo of our own.
It does not believe in fairy tales about

91
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:41,401
Chakras or energy with a power belief.
There is no such thing as spirit.

92
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,660
This is the longterm danger of cliche.
The more we allow it to happen,

93
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,494
the harder it is to escape,
the more difficult it is for audiences 

94
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:55,270
and writers to tell the difference.
The last thing we want is to see our own

95
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,880
lives through the Lens of art.
That's only passable.

96
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,103
New perspectives are what we need.
Originality is what we should encourage 

97
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,880
you at every chance.
Otherwise,

98
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,910
I'm afraid our movies and ourselves will
change into something quite different.

99
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,900
What's it called?
The imitation game.

100
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,510
There is a new nerdwriter episode.
Every Wednesday.

101
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,880
Guys will be click that box that I've 
set up for you right over there.

102
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:26,890
You'll get a.
you'll get the videos,

103
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,210
you'll get up,
you'll get all the videos.

104
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,223
Did you hit that little bell on mobile?
I think you get notified when I release 

105
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,120
something new,
so we do that too.

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,550
Thanks to squarespace for sponsoring 
this video.

107
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:37,384
They make sleek,
intuitive website designs for you to 

108
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:43,390
customize and you don't have to know 
coding to make a really beautiful one.

109
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,730
Um,
if you sign up for a year,

110
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:49,150
you can get a free domain name and if 
you use the offer code nerdwriter,

111
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,010
you can get 10 percent off your first 
purchase.

112
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,750
So that's pretty cool.
Thank you so much.

113
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,080
I will see the arrest of view next 
Wednesday.

114
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,270
I was a weird and scream,
I think I'm going to use it.
