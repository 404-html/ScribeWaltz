1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,100
Why not a Tuesday evening and block 20?

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,490
Hello and welcome to the nerd writer 
after dark,

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,713
the only place in the big black ether to
hear about the sexy side of high 

4
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:23,764
finance.
My name is the nerd writer and I'm here 

5
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:29,110
to be your guide through the titillating
seas of fiscal irresponsibility,

6
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:33,580
helping you in any way I can take it 
your assets in order,

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,770
out of order,
whatever suits your financial fancy,

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,023
and I'm joined as always by my cohost,
the very mysterious original 

9
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:42,390
circumstance.
How you doing tonight,

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,480
Reggie?
Just fine.

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,591
What's that?
You got there?

12
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,424
Read this.
My friend is a 78 Marillo by foreign 

13
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:47,954
Yantais,
the same urine vintage drunk by the 

14
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,490
senior associates at the blackstone 
group.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,780
The same year they acquired the Howard 
Johnson Franchise in 1990.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,330
Wow.
That is vintage.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,940
I'm actually drinking a very special 
bottle myself here.

18
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,774
Read this is an 89 Pino noir by wooden 
head sent over by the board of Bain 

19
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:08,284
capital.

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,480
This vintage they drank when staples 
inc.

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,493
One of their very first investments went
public and it's also the wind that they 

22
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:18,100
were drunk off of their gourds on when 
this picture was taken.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,730
TOnight I want to talk about one of the 
sexiest figures in the nation.

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,430
If not the world.
I think you know who I mean and no,

25
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,670
I'm not talking about beyonce or mr.
Circumstance over there.

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,720
This is a man with both public sector 
and private sector experience.

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,420
you guessed it.
I am talking about the one the only,

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,030
the irresistibly erotic,
mitt romney.

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,893
Mr romney is currently in contention for
the republican presidential nominee 

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
touted by many as the front runner in 
that race,

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,923
though a week turn out in South Carolina
has many predicting that this might 

32
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,244
become a stripped to the waist mud 
wrestling match between mit and the 

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,640
improbably.
New bile newt gingrich.

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,480
Ladies I know I'm not the only one who 
wants to see these two sands shirt,

35
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,000
but politics is the bag of a different 
show here.

36
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,360
We are more interested in what mr romney
did before he set his sights on the oval

37
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:05,194
office and since the man himself puts 
his experience at bain capital at the 

38
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,374
forefront of his campaign,
I think it's only appropriate that we 

39
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,700
explain and analyze that experience.
What do you think,

40
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,440
reggie?
I think I'm drunk now.

41
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:15,274
Those who know me know that there are a 
few things that make my cherries tingle 

42
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:22,540
more intensely than private equity,
but what is private equity after all?

43
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,374
Well,
private equity isn't asset class 

44
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:27,280
consisting of equity securities in 
operating companies,

45
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,580
not publicly traded on a stock exchange.
Well,

46
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,151
nerdwriter.
Hey,

47
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,220
that sounds like a lot of gobbledygook 
to me.

48
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,971
Okay.
Reggie,

49
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,800
I think I.
I think I get your point here.

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,100
So private equity or pe used to be 
called leveraged buyout or lbo.

51
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,063
It's the practice by which a private 
equity firm like bain capital uses a 

52
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:45,934
fund of money to buy out a small or 
underperforming company to flip it for 

53
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,670
profit.
It's like flip that house.

54
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,970
You've seen that show?
I love that show.

55
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,863
Okay,
so let's say that you have a company 

56
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,990
that you want to sell,
and I'm a private equity firm.

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,270
Now the price you put on your business 
is,

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,133
let's say $10.
What I'm going to do is raise 1 million 

59
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,270
through my investors.
That's the equity.

60
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,880
The other 9 million I'm going to borrow 
from the bank.

61
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,650
That's the leverage.
Okay,

62
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,484
so now that I have the 10 million,
I'm going to buy out your company with 

63
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,130
$9,000,000
in debt in come in and try to streamline

64
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,430
all the aspects of that business,
going to make things more efficient.

65
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,930
The layoff,
unproductive.

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Employees decrease overhead after five 
years.

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,220
Let's say that I succeeded and now your 
business is worth 20 million.

68
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,600
What I'm going to do is pay back the 
bank,

69
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,434
gets 9 million plus interest and then 
split the rest between myself and the 

70
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,174
investors.
This is the basic model of a leveraged 

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,150
buyout.
How's that?

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,220
So it looks like we have our first 
caller here.

73
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,400
Hello,
you're on with the nerd writer.

74
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,453
What is your question?

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,290
I'm a long time and they love your show.
Thank you.

76
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,100
private equity is good or bad for the 
economy seats.

77
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,293
I think I won't be able to run this 
building from the ground reconsidering 

78
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,520
how,
but I don't like to know what impact is.

79
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:04,010
Industry as well.

80
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,710
That's a great question,
mary,

81
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,450
and a tough one.
See these days,

82
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,284
romney presents himself as a job creator
recently saying we started a number of 

83
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,850
businesses for in particular created a 
hundred and 20,000

84
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,280
jobs as of today and there's no doubt 
that private equity,

85
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,114
especially venture capitalism and arm of
private equity firms invest in startup 

86
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,950
companies,
can create jobs,

87
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:28,060
especially if you make a good bet like 
romney and bain capital did with an idea

88
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:32,170
for supermarket of office supplies which
later became staples.

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,790
The problem is that streamlining cutting
the fat can often mean job losses and If

90
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,190
the investment goes sour,
well everybody loses.

91
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,940
Even you married since your accountant 
has invested some of your own funding.

92
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,823
the deal,
I'll hark capitalists like romney say 

93
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,930
that this is unnecessary risk of the 
system and maybe it is,

94
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,033
but the problem with the term job 
creators is that job creating is never 

95
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:56,530
the intended function of any of these 
private equity firms.

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,633
The purpose of bain taken directly from 
its website is to deliver industry 

97
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:04,420
leading returns for its investors to 
deliver the best returns.

98
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,420
Job creation and job loss are a 
byproduct,

99
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,580
and this brings me to my central point.

100
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,873
It was romney and his peers at the 
inception of a revolutionary new 

101
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,550
industry called leveraged buyout or 
private equity,

102
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,370
who helped to redefine american 
business.

103
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,443
See these men,
a schism between the incentives of a 

104
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:31,034
company's owners,
otherwise known as shareholders and the 

105
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,020
incentives of its management.
To rectify this,

106
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,020
they acquired the companies themselves 
via leveraged buyout,

107
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,363
manage them themselves,
and gave existing management and equity 

108
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:45,130
stake in the company in the form of 
stock or stock options.

109
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:45,964
This is the beginning of huge executive 
compensation which gets the goat of 

110
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,550
those occupy protesters.
The revolution is more clearly stated as

111
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:58,070
the total alignment in the incentives of
accompanies owners,

112
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,143
its board,
and its management around stock holder 

113
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,923
value.

114

democracy and the recession,
see blog number four.

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,873
You can find that link in the dubliner.
I'm afraid that's all the time we have 

116
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,544
tonight on the nerd writer after dark.
I do want to remind everyone that ridge 

117
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,130
is a fine guitar player and he does do 
all bar mitzvahs,

118
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,330
weddings,
and corporate functions.

119
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,883
I want to wish you all a good night.
I made your stocks rise in the morning 

120
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,350
and may your competitors go utterly 
bankrupt.

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,370
Hello,
issue a merry christmas.

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Merry christmas.
Merry christmas from the bottom of my.
