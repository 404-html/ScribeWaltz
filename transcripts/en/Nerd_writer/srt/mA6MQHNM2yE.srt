1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,643
Secondary worlds are fascinating.
It's no surprise that we're obsessed 

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,040
with them,
that we want to explore them,

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,920
learn more about how they work.
Take a look at this app.

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,950
Google chrome made for the release of 
the hobbit films.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,190
It's a hyper realistic rendering of 
middle earth,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,220
far from the sketches of tolkien himself
farther still from the words you used to

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,124
describe it.
The chrome program can be considered an 

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,650
act of world building,
an extension of tolkiens own world,

9
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,410
building in the Lord of the rings and 
more intensely in the silmarillion.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,510
There's something so in chanting in the 
complexity of his vision,

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,840
in its completeness,
in the completeness of the languages and

12
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,320
the fact that they work.
It's impossible when reading Lord of the

13
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,154
Rings,
not to feel that middle earth is 

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,883
autonomous,
that it exists despite your reading 

15
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,454
about these days,
we have our pick of dense secondary 

16
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:58,230
world fantasy literature is filled with 
them.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,093
Think of the Dune series or Narnia or 
the late Terry Pratchett's discworld 

18
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,594
novels.
Think of the race to fill in the 

19
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,990
histories of star wars,
in books,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,820
video games,
and new films,

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,803
or take the secondary world.
We're most obsessed with at the moment 

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,650
the world of Westeros in George Rr 
Martin is a song of ice and fire.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,513
None of these worlds are our own,
but each is internally consistent and 

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,520
each has developed audiences that hunger
for the author to fill in the margins,

25
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,170
the gaps,
the geography,

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,790
the backstories,
the histories,

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,580
and if the author won't,
they'll do it themselves.

28
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,170
Want to know more about correspond or 
Darth sidious visit pdf,

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,880
perhaps the most exhaustive catalog of a
secondary world ever made.

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,910
Why are we so consumed by built worlds 
by the act of world building?

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,460
Is this a generous obsession or a 
dangerous one?

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,313
The great science fiction and fantasy 
writer m John Harrison once famously 

33
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,554
called world building the attempt to 
exhaustively survey a place that isn't 

34
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:00,480
there.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,290
Harrison's point is that the world 
building of much fantastic fiction which

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,410
takes toll keens legendary them as its 
archetype,

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,513
shifts the focus of literature away from
the act which is most vital to its 

38
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,424
usefulness.
The act of reading world building in 

39
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,724
this view assumes a passive reader.
It envisions a writer who photographs a 

40
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,064
secondary world,
encodes it into language and a reader 

41
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,454
who receives this immersive experience 
like a film blissfully and perhaps 

42
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,940
willingly unaware that the world he 
experiences is a rhetorical construct.

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,590
The only problem is that all these 
assumptions are based on false premises.

44
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,880
You can't encode the world in language.
Readers are never passive.

45
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,370
They create the text as much as a writer
does,

46
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:51,840
and all texts are rhetorical constructs.
In other words,

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,943
writing is always a game.
It's a transaction that emerges from a 

48
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:01,750
writer's implications and a readers.
Interpretive toolbox.

49
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:04,720
World building fiction seems to deny 
this transaction,

50
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,700
replace it with a cleaner one in which 
the story on offer is like a clock,

51
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,190
and the writer is like the clockmaker.

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,323
The problem is that this kind of fiction
creates a dependency in the reader to 

53
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,910
know more,
to know everything.

54
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,760
I feel this way all the time when I'm 
watching game of thrones,

55
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,060
it's what sends me online.
Looking for backstories.

56
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,750
Perhaps this is why Harrison's own take 
on the fantasy genre is great.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,793
Viera conium novels resists so 
forcefully this urge for dependency in 

58
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:34,894
Veera conium.
Nothing is ever the same twice from 

59
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,100
story to story.
Names change.

60
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,530
History's changed.
Characters recur,

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,980
but it's never clear if they're the same
people you met before.

62
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,240
Like all books,
Vira.

63
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,760
Conium is just some words,
says Harrison.

64
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,190
There is no place,
no society,

65
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:56,191
no dependable furniture to make real.
You can't read it for that stuff,

66
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,020
so you have to read it for everything 
else.

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Everything else.
That's the bill of goods.

68
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,961
The ideas and insights that spring forth
from the explosive act of reading the.

69
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,853
For the record,
I think toking did offer that bill of 

70
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,480
goods.
He offered a poetic utterance,

71
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,373
a metaphor.
It was the attempt of those who came 

72
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,223
after to literalize that metaphor and 
dilute its imagery by asking things 

73
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,550
like,
what did sal ron look like?

74
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:28,060
Or just how might an Elf regiment 
organize itself.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,953
It's important to note that world 
building is not exclusive to fantastic 

76
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,914
fiction.
It's a staple of real world fiction as 

77
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,690
well,
and indeed the real world.

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,530
It's current popularity is unsurprising 
given our modern world,

79
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,010
which is its own kind of fantasy.
Indeed.

80
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:48,460
This is what makes world building so 
potentially dangerous.

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,413
The world building of fiction only 
greases the wheels for it's much more 

82
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,734
insidious and terrifying cousin 
political pro building the constructed 

83
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:01,750
world presented to us by politics,
marketing,

84
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,584
and the media.
The act of narcissistic fantasy 

85
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,373
represented by the word l'oreal already 
exists well upstream of j Dot k rowling 

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,190
or Jrr tolkien.

87
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,263
Neither of them is anywhere near as 
successful at world-building as the 

88
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,920
geniuses who devised coke or the 
Catholic church.

89
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,690
I am a huge fan of totalking and game of
thrones and star wars,

90
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,003
but I'm also wary and worried about a 
strain of passivity and people that 

91
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,623
world building fiction seems to best 
reflect and at worst encourage who we 

92
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,560
are is already hugely and powerfully 
managed by interested parties all around

93
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:45,994
us.
Maybe we all at least to seek out 

94
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,540
fiction,
fantastic or otherwise.

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,870
That's a bit more impish and challenging
that demands our engagement that rattles

96
00:05:55,811 --> 00:06:00,260
our perspective and exposes the false 
fronts of the fantasy.

97
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,290
We were born into the world that was 
built without our consent.

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,940
