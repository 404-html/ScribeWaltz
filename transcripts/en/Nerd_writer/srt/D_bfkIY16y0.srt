1
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,970
Thanksgiving wasn't always like it is 
today,

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,770
the domestic family meal football,
the parade leftovers,

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,000
black Friday like Christmas.
It used to be a holiday of festivals,

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,863
outdoor revelry,
and drinking too much like today's 

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,290
Halloween.
In fact,

6
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,400
children would dress up in costumes and 
go begging for money or treats.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,770
If you were growing up in 19th century,
New York City,

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,060
you might see a group of crossdressers 
called the fantastical marching the city

9
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:47,061
streets ridiculing authority figures.
It wasn't until the mid 18 hundreds that

10
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,880
Sarah Josepha Hale,
the godmother of Thanksgiving as we know

11
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,520
it,
started writing her famous editorials in

12
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,354
goatees magazine,
recontextualizing the holiday as a 

13
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,990
domestic occasion,
one in which distance sons and daughters

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,033
returned home for a family feast.
She urged governors and presidents to 

15
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,210
adopt the last Thursday in November as a
national holiday,

16
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,044
and her letters shake with notes of 
urgency and the spare is the country 

17
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:15,450
slid to civil war.

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,763
Thanksgiving,
she hoped might hold together under the 

19
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:23,010
banner of brotherhood and gratitude of 
Fragile Union.

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,020
It didn't work,
of course,

21
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,460
but in 18,
63,

22
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,610
president Lincoln did make Thanksgiving,
a federal holiday.

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,463
The point of pride for Union states then
for the rest of the country as it 

24
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:34,494
rebuilt after the war,
Hail Lincoln and others of that period 

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,543
effectively rewrote Thanksgiving as 
something that happens in doors with 

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,853
families,
a joyful reuniting but no longer have 

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,403
rawkus.
The tectonic changes of the industrial 

28
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:52,170
and commercial revolutions were pulling 
families apart.

29
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:57,171
They felt threatening to weaken the ties
and values that grounded the nation over

30
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,344
the next decades into the 20th century.
Thanksgiving lost its tolerance for 

31
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:05,910
begging children and drunk and marchers 
and picked up new traditions like annual

32
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,744
football games and the macy's Day parade
teachers taught the story of 

33
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,824
Thanksgiving to their students,
many of whom urge their immigrant 

34
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,660
parents to celebrate the national 
ritual,

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,250
a way of stirring patriotism,
and as with all forms of assimilation,

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,520
foreign cultures are both absorbed into 
and erased by the dominant culture.

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,053
The thanksgiving Turkey and its many 
side dishes are a great metaphor for 

38
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:30,954
these twin tendencies and many brought 
dishes from their own cultures into the 

39
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:39,420
feast to remember their diverse pasts.
As long as the Turkey rained.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,313
Overall,

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,643
this is all to say that traditions like 
Thanksgiving aren't natural by any 

42
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,234
means.
They're invented and at the time of 

43
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:50,054
their invention they call to a past 
that's not really there and imagined 

44
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:58,250
past a constructed authenticity that 
serves the purposes of the president.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,270
Indeed,
even the awareness of such traditions is

46
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,104
a relatively modern phenomenon,
anchoring points for a culture in 

47
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:08,650
constant and progressively more rapid 
change.

48
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,890
There's a lot in the DNA of Thanksgiving
worth holding onto,

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,993
but there's a lot of which we'd be 
better off without a rosy and false 

50
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,200
account of our early settlers,
friendship with the native Americans and

51
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,034
ideology of female domesticity and 
anachronistic remnant of the separate 

52
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,510
spheres.
Way of thinking that said,

53
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,930
a woman's rightful place was at home in 
front of the stove.

54
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,330
The assimilation of other cultures,
races,

55
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:36,160
and classes into a largely white and 
largely Protestant system of thinking.

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,720
For me,
the core of Thanksgiving is family.

57
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,140
The family I was born into,
the family I chose,

58
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,974
the community I live in and the nation 
that gives me the freedom to think 

59
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:51,400
through and if I want criticize it's 
values.

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,700
These days in the wake of terror around 
the world,

61
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,534
what our worst reactionary tendencies 
are flared by those far too willing to 

62
00:03:59,141 --> 00:03:59,940
stoke fear

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,190
at anchor.
It's worth remembering,

64
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,240
I think just how many different families
we all belong to.

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,830
We may be celebrating in separate homes,
but in reality,

66
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,340
each family in America blends into the 
next.

67
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,190
If the history of Thanksgiving shows us 
anything,

68
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:22,170
it's that holidays like these are open 
to revision as Americans.

69
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,580
Thanksgiving is ours to reframe just as 
the country is.

70
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,850
That's an important responsibility for 
all of us.

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,660
Have responsibility for which I give.
Thanks.

72
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,623
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching and happy 

73
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:41,090
Thanksgiving to everybody out there.
I hope you're with your families or with

74
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,933
people that you love going home to my 
family and I can't wait to see all of 

75
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,620
them.
If you want to support the nerd writer,

76
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:47,454
if you think that the nerdwriter is 
something that you're not seeing 

77
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,030
anywhere else on youtube or the 
Internet,

78
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,043
you can go right here and pledged to my 
patrion page as little as a dollar per 

79
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:56,970
video.
Everything helps.

80
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,580
You guys have been amazing,

82
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:08,640
better videos and I hope you guys are 
seeing a return on what you're giving to

83
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,530
me because,
uh,

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,493
it's very,
very generous and I don't take it 

85
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,250
lightly.
So thank you guys again,

86
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,290
happy Thanksgiving and I'll see you next
Wednesday.
