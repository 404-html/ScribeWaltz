1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,113
Since around 2008 when the DSLR 
revolution full frame sensors in the 

2
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,020
hands of amateur filmmakers and 
videographers,

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,153
super shallow depth of field has become 
something of a cliche in indie 

4
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,500
filmmaking.
For a lot of filmmakers,

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,573
myself included.
This effect was used not just as a tool 

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,760
but as a crutch to achieve that 
cinematic look.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,910
These days,
super shallow focus is everywhere.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,330
It's a fashion more than a technique,
so it's really,

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,660
really cool to see an episodic show like
the handmaid's tale,

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,733
incorporate the effect in a systematic 
way as a motif of its visual language 

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,910
and the director of the first three 
episodes of the show,

12
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,490
the director who set the tone is Reed 
Morano,

13
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,060
a former cinematographer.
She in her own DP for this project,

14
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:51,894
Colin Watkinson created an extremely 
concentrated aesthetic one that is 

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,110
beautiful and terrifying at the same 
time.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,303
To capture the dystopian world of 
Gilliad meant choosing the right camera 

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,660
and the right lenses.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,793
Marano shot on the Arri Alexa Minis in 
four K and use lenses that open all the 

19
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,390
way up to apertures of one point three 
and one point four,

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,253
which means your depth of field is going
to be razor thin and everything outside 

21
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:20,640
of that field is going to be blown out 
in a pretty uniform blur.

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,060
This shallow focus serves the story in 
three ways.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,610
First,
to capture the main character's point of

24
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:31,611
view offered played by Elizabeth Moss is
a handmade in the republic of Gilead,

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,723
a theocratic and totalitarian state that
has overtaken America in which women no 

26
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:37,014
longer have any rights.
Handmaids are the last woman who can 

27
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,464
still have children.
The rest of society being largely 

28
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:46,440
sterile and they're forced to bear 
children for leaders of the regime,

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,230
but it wasn't always like this before 
the revolution off.

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,083
Fred lived in the America of our time,
and the story of the handmaid's tale is 

31
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,960
really the story of the transition 
between America and Gilliad told through

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,600
the experience of offered to die.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,560
Listen to that horror read in Watkinson,
focus on the face.

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,780
It's hard to remember a show that relied
so much on one extreme closeup,

35
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,623
but Elizabeth Moss is definitely up to 
the task with a camera mere inches from 

36
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:14,574
her nose.
The filmmakers combined a wide 28 

37
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,640
millimeter Zeiss Lens,
used only for these shots with a shallow

38
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,660
depth of field to create intense 
intimacy with her bonnet on.

39
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,240
It's almost as if we're under a blanket 
with a character.

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,420
The shallow depth of field extreme 
closeups are an effective way to get the

41
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:32,320
audience to identify with,
offer it,

42
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,503
but they also point to an important 
theme that as a slave in an 

43
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,330
authoritarian state,
where your physical being is effectively

44
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:43,830
controlled by someone else,
you're only agency is mental.

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,860
The mind is where you have to retreat to
escape,

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,510
to plan,
and to remember.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,440
It's only a thin plane of focus,
but it's still yours.

48
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,280
Second,
shallow focus is used to help create the

49
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,114
world of Gilead.
Unlike many dystopias you see in film 

50
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,304
and TV,
Giliad is not a post apocalyptic world 

51
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,064
of rubble and ruin.
It's actually the opposite and 

52
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,074
meticulously manicured New England full 
of sunlight and green foliage reading 

53
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,923
Watkinson site.
Kubrick as an inspiration and they echo 

54
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:13,684
a lot of his one point perspective 
framings and definitely capture the 

55
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,270
creepiness of that,
but for the women of Gilliad,

56
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,110
what's notable about this world is how 
little they know about it.

57
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,283
Think of all the knowledge that's 
accessible to you through the Internet 

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,170
and Gilly ad.
Women are not only prohibited from going

59
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,330
online,
they're prohibited from reading.

60
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,223
Anything.
Result is a perspective that's 

61
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:34,744
extraordinarily narrow and shallow.
Depth of field captures this perfectly 

62
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,220
because it literally narrows the visual 
information in Focus.

63
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,950
The handmaid's tale is constructed in 
fragments.

64
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,000
You have America and you have Gilliad,
and the show gives you pieces in between

65
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,100
the two,
but never the full timeline.

66
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,293
This is in part because the show's 
primary characters don't have the full 

67
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:57,130
timeline themselves,
this brutal new world,

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,250
or at least the conditions that made it 
possible snuck up on them.

69
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
I have to let you go,
but that doesn't mean it came out of 

70
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,410
nowhere that they aren't somehow 
connected.

71
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,603
For example,
even though reading Watkinson adopted 

72
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,980
more handheld verite style for the 
flashbacks,

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,110
the shallow focus remains and they do 
this.

74
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,944
I think to suggest that both worlds 
suffer from problems of limited 

75
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,820
perspective in Gilead perspective is 
limited by force,

76
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,570
but in our world perspective is limited 
by choice.

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,750
We keep our heads down,
eyes glued to our screens,

78
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,823
stuck in our echo chambers.
While the blurry world around us 

79
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,363
changes.
It brings home a vital message that our 

80
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:36,364
rights are not guaranteed by the world.
We fight for them and have to protect 

81
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:40,984
them everyday because it can be taken 
away from us if we don't pay attention 

82
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
to the world.

83
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,360
Beyond our focus.
Everyone likes shallow depth of field.

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,400
It's beautiful and because it's 
beautiful,

85
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,280
everyone uses it to make their work look
better,

86
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,260
more professional,
more cinematic,

87
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,120
and as a result,
we get used to seeing it.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,553
When I watch the handmaid's tale,
I was amazed at how much the depth of 

89
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:07,060
field influence my feelings about the 
characters and the world and the story.

90
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,930
It's just rare that you see this device 
used with such purpose,

91
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:14,650
so methodically and so effectively,
and it really is effective.

92
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,113
If you don't believe me,
binge watch a few episodes of the 

93
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:21,430
handmaid's tale than go outside at 
guarantee.

94
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,850
You'll have a new found respect for how 
much there is to see.

95
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,000
One of the questions I

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,960
get asked the most is what software I 
use to make these videos to edit.

97
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:39,794
I use final cut pro 10 and since 10 is 
so different from the version of the 

98
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:43,934
program that came before it.
I depended a lot on online videos to 

99
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,803
teach me the new features that these 
days you can pretty much teach yourself 

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,160
anything this way and skillshare is the 
perfect way to do it at skillshare is an

101
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:59,150
online learning community for with more 
than 16,000

102
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,420
classes in editing and graphic design,
animation,

103
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,770
web development,
and more.

104
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,903
All the classes are professional and 
understandable and follow a clear 

105
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,880
learning curve.
A premium membership begins around $10 a

106
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,310
month for unlimited access to all the 
courses,

107

we'll get a two month free trial.
In those two months.

109
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,210
You could easily learn the skills you 
need to start a new hobby or business.

110
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,343
You could learn editing or even 
something more specialized like after 

111
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,034
effects,
which I always say we'll be in demand 

112
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,374
forever.
You'll always have a job and skillshare 

113
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,090
has dozens of classes and after effects 
that can help you master that program.

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,550
What's the skill that you've been 
putting off learning?
