1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,273
But isn't it on America and wrong to 
discriminate against people based on 

2
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:05,474
their religion?

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,423
Really the problem.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,150
We have people coming into our country 
that are looking to do tremendous harm.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,440
You look at the t,
look at Paris,

6
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,930
look at what happened in Paris.
I mean these people,

7
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:21,910
they did not come from Sweden.
Okay?

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,133
Look at what happened in Paris.
Look at what happened last week in 

9
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:30,001
California with with 14 people dead.
Other people going to die there so badly

10
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:31,804
injured mean we have a real problem.
There's a tremendous hatred out there 

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,350
and what I want to do is find out what 
you know.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,680
You can't solve a problem until you find
out what's the root core cars and I want

13
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,350
to find out what is the problem,
what's going on?

14
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:45,184
And it's temporary.
I've had so many people call me and say 

15
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:48,820
thank you.
Now,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,500
if you remember when I did that a week 
ago,

17
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,334
it was like bedlam all of a sudden and 
you watched last night and you see 

18
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,050
people talking to say,
well,

19
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,330
trump has a point.
We have to get down to the problem.

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,870
The people that are friends of mine,
they called,

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,750
they said,
Donald,

22
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:06,751
you've done us a tremendous service 
because we do have a problem and we have

23
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:09,960
to find out those crank calls.
Those may have been.

24
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,070
Yeah,

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,903
great.

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,763
One of the things I find fascinating 
about Donald Trump is the way he uses 

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,690
language differently than other 
candidates for political office,

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,150
especially for president of the United 
States.

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,283
Whereas his opponents and the political 
class in general seem hyper aware that 

30
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:30,740
their words will be picked apart and 
used against them.

31
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,430
Trump willfully disregards this fact as 
a lifelong salesman,

32
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:37,910
he has a hucksters knack for selling the
feeling,

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,893
even if the ideas and facts that 
underscore it are spurious racist or 

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,070
just plain incomprehensible.
So I thought it would be illuminating to

35
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,680
look at a trump answer to a simple 
question.

36
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,530
In this case,
Jimmy Kimmel asking trump whether or not

37
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:55,190
it's wrong to discriminate against 
people based on their religion,

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,233
referring to trump's proposal to 
temporarily ban all Muslims from 

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,480
entering the United States.
This 220 word,

40
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:07,100
exactly one minute answer displays.
I think a range of the things that trump

41
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,963
uses all the time in his speech,
the first thing to note is how simple 

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,153
this languages of the 220 words,
a 172 or 78 percent are only one 

43
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,830
syllable,
and often they come in a rhythmic series

44
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:25,520
like a volley of Jabs,
ending with one of his buzzwords.

45
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,383
We have to get down to the prop.
Thirty nine words or 17 percent are two 

46
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:33,440
syllables long.
Only four words have three syllables,

47
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,780
three of which are the word.
Tremendous,

48
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,270
tremendous,
tremendous,

49
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,620
and just two words are four syllables 
long,

50
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,483
California,
which he's forced to use because it has 

51
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:45,590
less syllables than San Bernardino and 
temporary,

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,633
which he swallows and it's temporary.
I've had so many people just breakdown 

53
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,523
fits with the study done by the Boston 
Globe that put all 2016 presidential 

54
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:58,340
candidates announcement speeches through
the flesh,

55
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:02,740
kincade readability tests to determine 
their respective grade level rankings.

56
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,760
Donald Trump's speech came out at a 
fourth grade reading level.

57
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,150
Now for reference,
Ben Carson came out at sixth grade.

58
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,103
Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were 
speaking at an eighth grade reading 

59
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,104
level,
and Bernie Sanders was way up in high 

60
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,070
school,
a sophomore to be exact.

61
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,940
Now,
this isn't only down to word or syllable

62
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:22,510
choice.

63
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,400
It's about sentence construction to 
trump favors simple sentences like,

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,850
and we have a real problem.
There's a tremendous hatred out there.

65
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,960
Rarely does he use complex sentences or 
independent clauses.

66
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,093
You also favors the second person.
A lot of time addressing listeners 

67
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,810
directly with commands.
Look at Paris,

68
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:43,240
look at what happened in Paris.
Look at what happened in past.

69
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,103
Look at what happened last week in 
California or implicating us in what 

70
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,584
he's saying as if we've already agreed 
and you watched last night and you see 

71
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,634
people talking.
He's really good at this at framing 

72
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:58,270
negative response as an overreaction.
That was subsequently realized as such.

73
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,990
If you remember when I did that a week 
ago,

74
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:00,824
it was like bedlam all of a sudden and 
you watch last night and you see people 

75
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,500
talking to say,
well,

76
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,750
trump has a point.
We have to get down to the problem.

77
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,613
Maybe the most important technique trump
utilizes and he does this more than 

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,000
anyone I've ever heard,
is ending his sentences with strong,

79
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,290
punchy words.

80
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,153
A lot of times he'll rearrange the 
beginning of a sentence awkwardly so 

81
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,020
that he can end strong.
For example,

82
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,360
here,
it would probably be more natural to say

83
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,440
you can't solve a problem until you find
out what the root cause is,

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,940
but he brings the is forward to end on 
root cause.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,833
He does the same here and it looks like 
that's what he was about to do at the 

86
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,620
end before Kim will cut some off.
These final words are crucial for trump.

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,813
They're pointed and taken together.
Sketch the theme of the entire answer 

88
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,530
are dead.
Die Badly injured problem root cars.

89
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,750
Thank you Edna Bravo service problem.
In some sense,

90
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,240
it's these words that audiences 
remember,

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,930
especially when the rest of his speech 
is incoherent.

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
Like the best salesman.
Trump keeps it simple.

93
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,420
He repeats a lot and we have a real 
problem.

94
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,610
What is the problem?
We do have a problem.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,473
We have to get down to the problem and 
he uses his favorite words over and 

96
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,500
over,
tremendous,

97
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,960
tremendous,
tremendous service,

98
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,823
and he always seems to have friends who 
are part of the group that he's 

99
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:17,854
currently insulting.
Calling him up and thanking him for the 

100
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,910
privilege.
Many of them called me and they said,

101
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:22,451
you know,
Donald,

102
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,650
you're right.
We have a problem.

103
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,000
Look,
there is a problem.

104
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,890
Donald trump knows when to sound 
incredulous or forceful.

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,100
He has good comedic instinct.
You could even call him woody,

106
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,820
but you can't call him smart,
are well informed.

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,193
The best salesman could sell you a TV 
without knowing anything about it 

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,630
because the TV isn't what matters.
What matters is you,

109
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,003
and if you are an American citizen who 
for years has listened to politicians 

110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,870
sound sophisticated while accomplishing 
nothing,

111
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,350
you might just be primed for something 
that is everything they are not,

112
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,200
but the next time you feel like Donald 
trump has a point,

113
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,190
do yourself a favor and look at his 
words.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,730
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

115
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,150
I want to point you in the direction of 
my friends over at wisecrack who do some

116
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,280
awesome work.
Some awesome video essays.

117
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,510
Um,
if you like my stuff,

118
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,710
you're definitely gonna like what they 
do.

119
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,540
They talk about books,
movies,

120
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,170
and my personal favorite is definitely a
bit philosophy,

121
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,560
which is like philosophy explained with 
Nintendo graphics.

122
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,060
So.
Well done.

123
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,140
I wish I'd thought of that.
Um,

124
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,460
anyway,
