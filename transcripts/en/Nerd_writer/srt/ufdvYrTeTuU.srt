1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,280
I try to make it seem like I'm just 
getting this out,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,680
but I know all the moves.
I know every little piece of it

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,760
just here,
just go here.

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,390
This is what a Louis Ck joke looks like.
It's a short one,

5
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:24,410
only 207 words,
but there are 207 words that are chosen,

6
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:28,430
very purposefully practiced until every 
one counts for something.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,743
Today,
I want to go through this joke beat by 

8
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:35,630
beat and explore how Louis C K 
Constructs and performs his comedy.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,613
My girls are six and nine now.
They're actually a really exciting age 

10
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,400
because they're learning to do some cool
stuff.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,190
I played monopoly with my kids.
That's really fun.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,233
Every joke has to have a premise,
an idea that the inevitable punchline 

13
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,614
will snap comedically into place.
The premise should be really clear 

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,120
whether it's implied as in some one 
liners or stated outright.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,223
As Chris rock once said,
a lot of comedians have great jokes and 

16
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,000
they don't like,
why isn't this working?

17
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,930
It's not working because the audience 
does not understand the premise.

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,823
In this case,
the premise has two parts accomplished 

19
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:11,870
in two senses.
First Louis is playing monopoly with his

20
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,850
daughters and second,
my nine year old.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,840
She can totally do monopoly.
This world actually totally gets how the

22
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:18,674
game works,
but she's not as emotionally developed 

23
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:21,644
enough

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,130
to handle her inevitable loss in every 
game of monopoly.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,133
The second part of this premise is 
beautifully structured because besides 

26
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,674
very lucidly delivering the premise that
this joke is going to be our six year 

27
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,740
old girl learns what it means to lose in
monopoly.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,933
Louis,
we actually get some laughs out of the 

29
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:44,250
sentence by the addition of a couple of 
words and a strategic rhythm.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,353
I mean the simplest way to end this 
sentence is to say that she's not 

31
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:50,850
emotionally developed enough to handle 
losing it monopoly,

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,013
but instead he said

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,080
to handle her inevitable loss in every 
game with monopoly.

34
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,123
In this way,
Louis adds to little comedic surprises 

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,633
in the premise and make sure to include 
a pause so that each can be appreciated 

36
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,200
in their own.

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,290
How to handle her inevitable loss in 
every game with monopoly,

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,700
because the monopoly last is dark.

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
It's heavy

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,513
mediums like Louis CK,
are experienced enough to master not 

41
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,970
only their own delivery,
but where the laughs will occur in their

42
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:25,804
jokes and how to deal with them.
Telling a joke is like riding a wave of 

43
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,360
feeling and if you watch Louis Ck is 
comedy,

44
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:35,920
you'll see that during laughs.
What he does is emphasize his last line.

45
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,320
It doesn't give the audience new 
information.

46
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,363
He augments the information just given 
something that he actually learned how 

47
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,144
to do brilliantly from Jerry Seinfeld.
I'm opening for Jerry in front of like 

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,930
12,
$100 or $20,

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,773
2,500
people and people are applauding bits 

50
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,140
and I had never encountered that and I 
didn't know how to handle it.

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,100
I asked Jerry what to do and he said,
you stay in the bed,

52
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,683
you stay in the.
They're reacting to if you're angry and 

53
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:02,794
that's why they're applauding.
You stay in that energy because a 

54
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,270
monopoly laws is dark.

55
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,230
It's heavy

56
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,683
candy.

57
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,000
Maybe you didn't get to win.

58
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,423
The choice of candyland here though 
Louis acts as if it was pulled out of 

59
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:28,950
thin air is the perfect counterpoint to 
monopoly.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,873
It's visual,
the game pop straight into your mind is 

61
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,274
an object of colorful innocence.
The drama and the funny voice is also 

62
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:37,770
performed like it was spontaneously made
up,

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,900
but the words and the images he uses 
like Fudgie thing and gummy twilio's are

64
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,960
carefully chosen to enhance that visual 
sense.

65
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,123
Louis is never not in control and that's
important because since the premise has 

66
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:55,110
been so strongly set up in the 
counterpoint drawn out so vividly,

67
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,213
the laughs that Louis gets here or 
actually lapsed in anticipation of a 

68
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:00,804
punchline,
not yet said the audience is already 

69
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:06,720
imagining how dark the monopoly last is 
going to be.

70
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,763
Just watch how he gradually increases 
these anticipatory laughs like the 

71
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,060
audience is a fiddle to the final three 
word punchline,

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,953
but when she loses it monopoly,
I got to look at her little face and I 

73
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:18,691
go,
okay,

74
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,830
so here's what's going to happen

75
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,723
now.
Okay,

76
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,780
all your property,

77
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,410
everything you have,
the railroads,

78
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,300
your houses,
all your money,

79
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,330
that's mine.
Now gotta,

80
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,820
give it all to me.
Give it to me.

81
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,800
One thing Louis doesn't get recognized 
for enough,

82
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,100
in my opinion,
is his ability to dramatize in his jokes

83
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,620
when he acts out this conversation with 
his daughter.

84
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,770
The light touchy gifts,
especially with that hand movement right

85
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:51,040
on the punchline,
really locks the audience into the space

86
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,874
where he wants them to be.
The audience needs to see the situation 

87
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,980
from a six year old perspective for it 
to work.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,133
Then if he succeeded,
the tags or the two additional 

89
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:03,640
punchlines that follow will be that much
more devastating.

90
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,790
Hilarious and no,
no,

91
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,624
you can't play anymore a see because 
even though you're giving me all of 

92
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,314
that,
it didn't even touch how much you owe 

93
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,680
me.
Doesn't even touch it.

94
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:18,320
Baby.
Going down to heart is really bad.

95
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,023
Putting the audience in the perspective 
of a six year old is important for 

96
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,650
another reason because I think on a 
deeper level,

97
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,484
Louis is actually trying to make a 
comment here on the actual ruthlessness 

98
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,403
of the economy we live in where property
really is taken away from people 

99
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:38,000
sometimes by monopolistic interests,
with debt to spare.

100
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,983
That's the thing.
His daughter is not emotionally 

101
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,900
developed enough to comprehend and when 
we see it through her eyes,

102
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,770
the reality seems even darker than it 
usually does,

103
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,760
especially in the final tab.
All you been working for all,

104
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,863
hey,
I'm going to take it now and I'm going 

105
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,610
use it to destroy

106
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,610
your sister.
Just mayhem on this board for her.

107
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:11,451
Now you know more than anything else,
I think I'm obsessed with articulation,

108
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,510
with the magic of putting things just 
the right way.

109
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,370
There are 207 words in this joke and not
a single one is wasted.

110
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,263
They're used either in meaning or in 
rhythm to contribute to the overall 

111
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,434
effect and effect that lets us see the 
world from a different angle and more 

112
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,620
importantly makes us laugh like great 
poetry,

113
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,513
great standup comedy is language 
distilled to its most potent form and 

114
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:41,310
these days few people distill it better 
than Louis Ck.

115
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,960
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching and thank you to the

116
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:52,570
great courses plus for sponsoring this 
episode.

117
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,550
If you love learning,
which I do,

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,473
obviously a great courses plus is a 
subscription on demand video learning 

119
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,224
service,
which essentially means that it's got 

120
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,260
great college level lecture series 
online about 7,000

121
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:06,520
subjects,
literature,

122
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,211
math,
science,

123
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:08,044
how to be a better photographer,
whatever from some Great Ivy League 

124
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,603
university professors.
I'm learning something right now about 

125
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:17,230
how great science fiction works because 
if there's a course in science fiction,

126
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm going directly for it.
Um,

127
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,580
if you go to the great courses 
plus.com/nerd

128
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:22,414
writer,
it was a link in the description for 

129
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,110
that and get a free month.
It's 1490 $9 per month after that.

130
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,123
It's just a great service.
If you want to sort of take some cool 

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,940
lecture series.
Thank you so much for that.

132
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,130
Also,
nerd writer,

133
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,750
nerdwriter.
It's finally I figured these out.

134
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:35,584
I really wanted to get the right color 
and the right fields so you would want 

135
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:42,211
to actually wear them outside and inside
DFTA figured it out in the best way.

136
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:45,520
You can go there and buy one of these.
Thank you guys so much for watching.

137
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,320
I'll see all of you next Wednesday.
I did.
