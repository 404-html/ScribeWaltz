1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,340
Homeland Security bill is ratified after
eight years.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,380
British borders.
It will remain closed.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,990
The deportation of illegal immigrants 
will continue.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,120
Good morning our lead story.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,740
The world was stunned today by the 
desert,

6
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:13,940
Diego,
Ricardo,

7
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:14,774
the youngest person on the planet,
maybe Diego was stabbed outside of bar 

8
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:19,660
and what?
Osiris.

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,640
Here we are,
first of all,

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,770
funds will Korans.
Children of men is a shot of an audience

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,903
getting information about the state of 
things in the same way that we do 

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,270
through the media.
You may have missed it,

13
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:35,104
but Korans fundamental motif of 
contrasting foreground and background 

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,650
has already been established through the
media before this shot even begins.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,130
Let's back up on the deportation of 
illegal immigrants will continue.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,270
Good morning our lead story like 
everyone else.

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,260
The media prioritizes information based 
on its values.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,153
So much attention is paid to the 
foreground to the lead story that the 

19
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,550
background can go by without much 
notice.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,503
The lead story of children of men is the
story of feel in a future world nearing 

21
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,184
its end,
because women have lost the ability to 

22
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:17,230
have children.
Theo and apathetic government bureaucrat

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,393
returns to his roots as a political 
activist after he sees that there is 

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,920
still hope left for humanity.

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,980
The film plays as an exciting action 
thriller,

26
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:31,660
as Leo helps the pregnant key get to 
safety with the human project,

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,750
but as the plot moves along it's linear 
path.

28
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,643
Following Theo,
the camera repeatedly becomes 

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,500
preoccupied with what's going on in the 
background,

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,693
and this is a technique that Koran has 
used in the past and it makes for an 

31
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:46,264
interesting effect.
As in thousands of other films we 

32
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,720
experienced the world through the eyes 
of the main character.

33
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,070
This process of identification is 
automatic and strong,

34
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,963
so strong that we can even be made to 
sympathize with people who we would 

35
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:01,534
otherwise identify as bad or evil.
So when the camera actively breaks that 

36
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:11,110
identification and shows us imagery,
the lead character doesn't see or notice

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,333
were made forcefully aware in a purely 
visual way of the perspective of the 

38
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:19,510
film itself.
In children of men.

39
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:22,270
That perspective is absorbed by the 
background,

40
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,600
by a bleak great winter break.

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,780
The only country in the world still 
under stable government control.

42
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,063
This background scene always at a side 
angle probes and investigates the 

43
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,074
conditions of that stability and whether
or not it's worth what sacrificed to 

44
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:39,994
have it,
though it's dressed up with the few 

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,393
futuristic flourishes the World Koran 
presents to us is a reflection of our 

46
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:49,270
own.
The grim combination of nationalistic,

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,300
xenophobic politics and late capitalist 
consumerism isn't something that we have

48
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,551
to imagine when Mexico sends its people,
they're not sending best.

49
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,650
They're bringing drugs,
they're bringing crime.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,840
They're rapists.
In 2006.

51
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,840
When this film was made only five years 
after nine slash 11,

52
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,390
and at the height of the war on terror,
this was,

53
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,470
and in many ways still is the state of 
things.

54
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,560
Thousands of migrants and refugees from 
the war torn and Middle East and Africa.

55
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,580
A rude awakening awaits in countries 
that are moving to close their doors.

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,473
And there's another background to a 
figurative background of cultural 

57
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,490
reference.
For example,

58
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,324
when key first reveals her pregnancy,
she stands in a posture reminiscent of 

59
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,123
Botticelli's birth of Venus.
One of the many references in this film 

60
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:40,310
to maternity,
Jasper and Miriam both recite,

61
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,243
teach.
We're calling both the pawnee shots and 

62
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,733
ts Elliot's the wasteland,
which is a major source of inspiration 

63
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,080
for an infertile world that's lost its 
way outside Theo's cousins,

64
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,973
arc of arts.
A pig floats above the old battersea 

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,760
power station and overt reference to 
pink floyd's album animals.

66
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,290
A concept album loosely based on George 
Orwell's animal farm itself,

67
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,910
a satirical indictment of authoritarian 
socialism or Stalinism.

68
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,370
Indeed,
there's a lot included in the arc of art

69
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,080
scene.
Here's a banksy.

70
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,093
Here's Michelangelo's David,
because those guarantee TCA 

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,273
significantly framing theo in the 
realities of war and underneath it all 

72
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:22,864
plays King Crimson's,
progressive rock anthem to the court of 

73
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,800
the Crimson King,
blending the sacred and the profane,

74
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,683
but Korans referencing becomes more 
potent as the inter texts layer and 

75
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,874
connect.

76
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,743
Take this shot here at utilizes nearly 
all the techniques I've mentioned so 

77
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,554
far.
You have the lead story moving again 

78
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,320
towards its destination at the sea,
but the camera,

79
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,680
it leaves them for a moment to focus on 
this mother,

80
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,514
cradling her dead son.
The most immediate citation here is to 

81
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,800
Michelangelo's famous sculpture,
La,

82
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,460
PA,
Ta,

83
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,890
which Nigel mentioned earlier in the 
film.

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,600
Good luck top smashed up before we got 
back,

85
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,150
and that sculpture at Mary holds the 
crucified Jesus in her arms,

86
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,103
questioning the cruelty of men.
The image also evokes guernica also 

87
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,570
shown earlier in the film a much more 
modern meditation on the horrors of war,

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,433
and Oran has said in interviews that the
inspiration for this image came from a 

89
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,150
photograph out of the Balkan wars 
itself,

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,993
a referenced to Michelangelo's work,
whereas the arc of arts shows are 

91
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,580
extracted in,
placed in an ivory tower.

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,593
Koran puts art back on the ground where 
it belongs and brings it alive within a 

93
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,370
number of contexts,
ancient and current,

94
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,970
and most importantly as a background for
the main story,

95
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,430
there is an absurd paradox that sits at 
the center of our modern world.

96
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,593
While capital itself knows no borders,
people and nations struggling to find 

97
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,534
their identities have sought repeatedly 
to tighten their borders and restrict 

98
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:01,790
people's from crossing them.
What's more,

99
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,653
these refugees are increasingly 
displaced by the militaristic medley of 

100
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,340
neoconservative regimes and the 
worsening climate,

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,263
a result of the unchecked expansion of 
capitalists enterprises in children of 

102
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:16,904
men as in our own world.
All of these things are intimately 

103
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,060
connected and yet for each of us 
individually,

104
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,910
it's hard to see anything but the 
foreground,

105
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,103
the lead story.
That's why the roving curious 

106
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,190
preoccupations of Koran's camera are 
more than just a site.

107
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,480
By providing a disinterested break from 
identification,

108
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,920
they achieved something.
We just can't in our own lives.

109
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,190
They let us see the world bear naked,
stripped for a moment of subjectivity.

110
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
This is the radical political potential 
of cinema.

111
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,840
We can all keep to our main stories.
If we want little worlds,

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,440
sooner or later,
the background is going to come from.

113
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,263
Wow,

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,250
everybody.

115
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,083
Thanks for watching.
I just got some awesome nerd writer 

116
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:19,580
stickers delivered that are now 
available on my patrion page.

117
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,414
You can get them by clicking right in 
the middle of the screen right here or 

118
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,640
in the description.
They are two stickers for $3,

119
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,720
one payment.
Boom.

120
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,680
You get them set.
Obviously.

121
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,060
I hope you continue to pledge after 
that.

122
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,760
They're awesome for laptops and 
backpacks and lunchboxes,

123
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,800
whenever you put stickers on their 
available.

124
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:34,634
Now my patrion page and a Patriot is 
what keeps the nerd writer alive and 

125
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,624
going,
and the big goal is to get that Patriot 

126
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,083
to a thousand dollars per video.
So thank you so much for helping me get 

127
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,090
there and making this possible.
This content is for you guys.

128
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,163
See you next Wednesday.
