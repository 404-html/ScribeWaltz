1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,853
So I'm notoriously disorganized when it 
comes to money and paying bills and 

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,210
personal finance in general.
I have no good reason for it.

3
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,790
Only to say that if left to my own 
devices,

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,743
I'd only ever read things and learn 
things and write things and make videos 

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,570
like this in respect to my greater 
happiness.

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,823
The only value money has is to give me 
the freedom to do the things I like in 

7
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,820
itself.
Money to me is worthless.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,713
And maybe that's the reason why I 
neglect it so much because it's time 

9
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,440
consuming and tedious and boring.
And clerical.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,860
I mean,
just to take a look.

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,470
Take a look at this.
Let me show you this right here.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,170
Perfect Metaphor for what I'm talking 
about.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,670
So here's a book of,
uh,

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,073
the philosophy of nature.
I've just been catching up on a little 

15
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,780
bit of nature as you do.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,140
And as a bookmark,
this is absolutely real.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
We have some macy's builts,
a Geico bill.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Here's one.
Here's a special one we got here.

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,600
Ah Ha.
Wells Fargo.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,710
Ah Yes.
The title to my car.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,440
Check this out.
I mean,

22
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:24,441
is that a system or what?
So today I've resolved to build a system

23
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,180
for myself to become more organized in 
this regard,

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,480
and there's only one place to go when 
you have a problem,

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,560
but you didn't know this.
When I.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,393
Staples was my first job.
I worked work area when I was a senior 

27
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:40,314
in high school for six months.
I don't know if they're going to let 

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,370
first item.
We need three ring binder.

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,050
What color do we like here?
What color is chartreuse?

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,790
Perhaps?
Item number two.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,520
File folders.
Okay.

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,590
Item number three,
we got binder clips.

33
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,140
Last item,
magnifying class.

34
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,423
Just kidding.
One of these desperate calculator so 

35
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:14,764
that you look really cool and that 
people in the other rooms know that 

36
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,480
you're deadly serious about finance item
for two sharpies.

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,983
Okay?
Make three ring binder holes in your 

38
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:34,790
folders.
First step.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay,
so got all the bills for my decks,

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,700
all the other extra stuff that's been 
mixing with it.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,960
First thing we're gonna do is take these
folders that I hope punch 12 of them.

42
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,503
Get that back.
We're going to write every month of the 

43
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,780
year on 12 volts.

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,610
Get it DSL.
Your reference.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,173
Yeah,
you're freaking out right now about how 

46
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:08,544
cool.

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,793
Now

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
take our folders marks with the months 
and put them into the binder.

49
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,590
Get a macy's bill here for April.
Okay,

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,920
so here's what we're going to go to the 
month of April and take one of our.

51
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,973
Find a rings here.
Dog thinks that these are snacks and 

52
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,600
toys would.
You shouldn't feed your dog binders.

53
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,930
The binder clips.
If we hadn't paid this,

54
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,764
macy's built the system would be to 
stick to clip it to the back of the 

55
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,490
envelope.
That means it's not paid.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,593
Now,
once we do pay it and I just didn't pay 

57
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:10,861
this,
kind of throw it in the inside and we're

58
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,024
good to go.
So we're going to do that to all these 

59
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,311
bills right now.
Okay,

60
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,580
so we're all done.
All the bills are in here.

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,180
And the 2012 binder,
we got all the paid bills in the folders

62
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,403
and what's not paid.
We got attached to the back to be sent 

63
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:45,871
in the mail.
Looking good organization.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,833
Item number five,
60 quarter coin rappers just for the 

65
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:58,241
hell of it.
Binder clips.

66
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,580
Item number 3:15
here.

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,250
That'll be just switch it up.
