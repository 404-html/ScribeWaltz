1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,993
So I was just watching the new live 
action beauty and the beast teaser 

2
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:08,554
trailer starring Emma Watson,
another remake of a 19 nineties Disney 

3
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:14,820
animation film,
and I noticed that the trailer ends with

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,920
two instantly recognizable symbols,
a red rose and an appeal to be our guest

5
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:22,744
from the first films famous song.
And it occurred to me that symbols like 

6
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:30,670
this have come to represent a new kind 
of emotional currency in Hollywood.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,460
The currency of intertextuality

8
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,210
picks you out something in a text,
in this case,

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,240
a movie that is shaped by another text 
that could be a film or a book or a play

10
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:54,564
or a song.
Intertextuality is something that you 

11
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,160
can't escape.
It says oldest storytelling is.

12
00:00:59,161 --> 00:00:59,994
It's how language works.
All language reaches back and is 

13
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,864
informed by how it was used in the past.
But today there seems to be a new kind 

14
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:12,150
of intertextuality born out of the 
endless series of sequels,

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,810
remakes and reboots,
the adaptations and shared universities.

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,213
And it's perfectly captured in that 
force awakens clip when the Millennium 

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,723
Falcon is revealed,
or later when Han Solo and Chewbacca 

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,323
board their ship,
or later still when bba pulls the cover 

19
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:30,240
off an old friend,
what do we feel in these moments?

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,403
It's a bit hard to pinpoint,
but personally I feel a kind of free 

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,310
sawn,
the chill.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,293
Everything I know about the intertextual
object in question unloads onto my mind 

23
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,940
like the vision ray gets when she first 
touches Luke's.

24
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,540
This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight,
clumsy or random.

25
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,374
As a block

26
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,243
intertextual.
References can point to genre 

27
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,374
conventions.
They can point to the texts influences 

28
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:03,890
or cultural and historical contexts,
but in this new generation of films,

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,753
more and more,
the intertextual manifests itself as 

30
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,263
objects.
People or situations specifically meant 

31
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,910
to trigger an emotional response in the 
viewer.

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,390
It's weaponized intertextuality 
goodness.

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,563
What's a bit troubling about this trend 
is that increasingly I'm seeing films 

34
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,740
use this kind of intertextual reference 
as a dramatic substitute.

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,023
I mean,
why else include Sour Ron in the hobbit 

36
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:31,880
trilogy,
for example,

37
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:36,881
when he appears nowhere in the book.
It seems to me that [inaudible],

38
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,660
that whole plot line was included purely
for intertextual payoff,

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,450
so you could cash out that feeling of,
Oh,

40
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:45,284
this is what these people were doing,
decades old series are right for this 

41
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,734
kind of thing,
and if you want a couple of examples of 

42
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:54,470
just how cheap these moments can be,
just take a look at two big intertextual

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,000
reveals.
My name is ka

44
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,973
man.
You're talking to now a man inside your 

45
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,260
head and stuff.
I'll blofeld

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,593
surprise motherfuckers.
It seems like this or kind of Unicorns 

47
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,090
blood.
They'll keep your story alive,

48
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,230
but only with half a soul.
One of my favorite TV shows when I was a

49
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,064
teenager was small,
filled by its very nature of that show 

50
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:22,244
was built around intertextual cues.
What made the show great the early 

51
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,230
seasons was how it took those cues and 
deconstructed them in unexpected ways.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,260
Namely in the friendship of Clark Kent 
and Lex Luthor.

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,513
Its strength was that fan service 
payoffs played second fiddle to deeply 

54
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,060
drawn relationships,
but in the later seasons,

55
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,894
the show began to lean a little too 
heavily on intertextual objects at 

56
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,490
moments from the superman.
Kennan,

57
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,383
really DC comics has always had this 
problem because it's heroes are 

58
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,463
mythological,
Batman and Superman are the 

59
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,860
quintessential intertextual characters.
Just seeing them at all is exciting,

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,203
but the recent Batman v Superman movie 
directed by Zack Snyder proved that the 

61
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,434
free sign of having these characters on 
screen together of having them fight 

62
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:09,520
each other was just no substitute for 
strong intelligent drama.

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,640
Snyder had a similar issue with his film
watchman.

64
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,690
Almost every shot in that film is a 
compositional Matt to the comic.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,960
It's trying to adapt now for those who 
read and love that comment,

66
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:20,794
there certainly is a thrill and seeing 
those frames and experiencing those 

67
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,890
textual moments come beautifully to life
when that's all there is.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,230
The final feeling is an empty one.

69
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,463
I think when cinematic storytelling is 
confined by an economic situation like 

70
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,490
this one,
where $300,

71
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,490
million dollar bets have to be safe 
ones,

72
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,480
weaponized intertextuality is going to 
be an inevitable byproduct.

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,471
I mean,
this year alone,

74
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:49,110
we have coming up finding dory 
independence day,

75
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,960
resurgence ghostbusters,
the angry birds movie,

76
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,970
a Jason Bourne sequels,
rogue one,

77
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:54,804
Star Trek beyond warcraft.
Expect to be flooded with weaponized 

78
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:01,380
intertextuality at every turn.
As I said before,

79
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:05,340
I don't think franchises and shared 
universes are bad by default,

80
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,413
quite the opposite at their best.
They build interpretive communities and 

81
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,840
foster social bonds and increasingly 
alienated world.

82
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,943
The kind of intertextuality that we're 
talking about can reflect these good 

83
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,570
qualities.
Then when it's done right,

84
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,840
when it's not a substitute for strong 
characters and a good story,

85
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,890
it can be funny excluding America and go
fuck yourself.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,783
It can be amusingly subversive and of 
course it can add to the drama while 

87
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,540
still being exciting as hell.

88
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,760
Hey everybody.
Welcome to the nerd writer end screen.

89
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,623
Thank you so much for watching that.
That was so much fun to make and I love 

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,893
thinking about stuff like this.
And if you want help me make more 

91

The small pledges helped so much and 

94
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,610
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
Oh,

95
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,920
and thank you so much for watching my 
video on taxes.

96
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,720
I didn't think that we'd get a lot of 
views,

97
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,490
but people really seem to like it.
So,

98
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,540
uh,
so cool.
