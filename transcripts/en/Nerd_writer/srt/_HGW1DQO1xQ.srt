1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,980
So you're in a museum looking at 
Picasso,

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,630
you've heard the name a million times,
you know the influence,

3
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:09,464
you know,
he's one of the most important artists 

4
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:11,870
of the 20th century.
You know,

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,490
he invented cubism,
you know,

6
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,230
he loved women,
lots of women,

7
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:16,820
and you know,
he wasn't that great to them.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,230
You know,
he had phases,

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,910
the blue period,
the rose period,

10
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,650
neoclassicism.
So realism,

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,120
but the painting,
you're looking at,

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,200
the one in front of you,
you've never seen it before,

13
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,400
and it's called night fishing at 
antibodies or on tv,

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,590
you don't really know.
You don't speak French,

15
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,720
a little card next to it doesn't say 
much,

16
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:34,970
but you want to know more about it.
How?

17
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,603
The way I see it,
you can look at any Picasso in five 

18
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,430
different ways.
The first and often,

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,820
the best way to understand any painting 
is simply to look at it.

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,110
Describe to yourself the objects and the
actions that you see the night fishing.

21
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:53,930
For example,
what you see as to spear fisherman,

22
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,920
hunting for fish from a small boat,
but by a mesmerizing light at the top of

23
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:58,754
the canvas.
One fisherman leans strongly into the 

24
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,490
water with his spear hesitating before 
delivering the final blow to a fish.

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,660
All the other liens languidly over the 
edge looking anxious.

26
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,210
The fishing line tied to his foot.
In the upper left,

27
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,044
we can see two towers and a massive 
purple shape swell around the fisherman 

28
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,930
fly moths or insect slipped by the 
light,

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,500
curving over the back of one of them 
toward the right side of the frame where

30
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:24,710
two women,
one with an ice cream cone and a bicycle

31
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,740
gesture to the men who don't seem to 
notice that much.

32
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,480
I find my first reactions to this entire
painting to be a bit contradictory.

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,373
On the one hand,
there seems to be a violent foreboding 

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,983
character to the scene.
The central focus is clearly the hand 

35
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:39,404
and the spear and the fish,
but there also seems to be an 

36
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,644
equilibrium here in the balance of 
colors and figures and almost magical 

37
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:51,020
view into an all too ordinary activity 
of fishing at night by lamplight.

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,960
And that brings us to the second way to 
examine this painting.

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,690
Understanding the actual content of the 
scene.

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,150
It is of course a night fishing seen in 
that light.

41
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,420
At the top is either the moon or an 
acetylene gas lamp,

42
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:06,110
which spear fisherman use to fish to the
surface of the water.

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,720
You can see another one under the boat 
in the upper left.

44
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:09,554
We can bet that those two towers in the 
massive purple shapes are the Chateau 

45
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,023
Grimaldi,
which by the way has since become a 

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,480
Picasso Museum and the water is the 
French Riviera at Auntie,

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,393
but resort town in the southeast of 
France where Picasso was vacationing in 

48
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,160
the summer of 1939.

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,293
According to his secretary,
Picasso had come across such fishing 

50
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:29,384
scenes,
walking the town at night after dinner 

51
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,023
and proceeded to lock himself in his 
studio to work on this really large 

52
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:37,730
canvases,
largest since Garren Aca,

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,760
which was completed two years before the
form of night fishing is in keeping with

54
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:46,010
Picasso's evolving style after Garren 
Hca,

55
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,023
which incorporates hold over elements 
from the cubist period and the flatness 

56
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,240
of the canvas,
and it's emphasis on geometrical shapes,

57
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,403
but it also pulls from the painters 
excursions into both surrealism and 

58
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:58,364
primitivism where basis become masks.
Indeed and so much of this painting in 

59
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,694
the cubist period and beyond,
the key point to remember is that 

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,353
figures are painted not as their 
perceived but as they're conceived 

61
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,933
because so ads to each body elements 
that signify to other bodies and to the 

62
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,870
canvas as a whole,
and for this reason,

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,733
the critic Douglas Morgan is right to 
say that we can't call Picasso's people 

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
distorted or grotesque because they 
haven't been distorted from anything.

65
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,060
There's no version of reality in which 
they're undistorted in night fishing,

66
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:34,894
that people are not meant to be 
sympathized with the normal reaction to 

67
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,730
a undistorted figure.
They're meant to be seen that naked.

68
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,564
Seeing that discernment communicates his
meanings more directly and what are 

69
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,450
those meetings?
Well,

70
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,343
there are a couple ways we can apply 
what we see in form and content to find 

71
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,060
out.
First,

72
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,940
it's worth it to look at the historical 
context.

73
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,850
The painting was completed in August 
1939,

74
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,000
just a couple weeks before the outbreak 
of world war.

75
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,570
Two.
Life in Europe was extraordinarily tense

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,673
and it was exceptionally so for Picasso 
who is still reeling from the sad 

77
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,770
conclusion of another conflict,
the Spanish civil war,

78
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,663
and the defeat of the Republican forces 
by Francisco Franco and his Nationalist 

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,500
Army Picasso opposed Franco in his work,
most notably in Guernica,

80
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,850
which is one of the most startling 
antiwar paintings in history and in some

81
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,684
ways night fishing and can be seen as a 
companion piece to guarantee instead of 

82
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:37,681
depicting all the violence of the former
Picasso shows a moment of hesitation.

83
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,853
The spear is likely to skewer the fish,
but it hasn't yet a moment of choice 

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,490
opens up and with choice.
There is hope.

85
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,940
The painter draws attention to this by 
making the hand gripping the spear,

86
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,490
the most realistic depiction in the 
canvas,

87
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,980
and as we move outward from that focal 
point,

88
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,480
things become increasingly warped and 
yet even with this hesitation,

89
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,860
the scene is suffused with a sense of 
almost apocalyptic apprehension.

90
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,993
The light at the top resembles a 
spiraling comment as much as it does a 

91
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:10,720
moon or a lamp juxtaposed next to a 
frightening blotch of read.

92
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,583
The paintings only use of that color.
The moths are like portents buzzing 

93
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,514
around the heads of the fishermen,
the jetty that the women stand on his 

94
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,440
unsteady,
the town in the background is a mess.

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,633
These feelings could be oppression,
imaging of the coming destruction of 

96
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,924
Europe.
Certainly the feeling in the air was 

97
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:28,234
hard to miss,
but more likely these dark undertones 

98
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,354
reflect an ongoing personal struggle 
with the loss of Picasso's native Spain 

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,153
to a vicious dictator,
but we're still missing one giant piece 

100
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,380
of the puzzle,
the personal context,

101
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,740
what was going on in the artist's own 
life in this respect,

102
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,680
it's worth it to ask who these people 
could possibly represent.

103
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,903
First,
let's look at the women while they both 

104
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,910
seek to get the attention of the 
fishermen.

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,753
They do so in different ways.
The one closest to them and in the 

106
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:59,600
closest proximity to the light,
spreads her arms in a graceful pose.

107
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,390
The other is more blahzay licking her 
ice cream cone.

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,673
Her obviously really very obviously 
phallic head and pronounced breasts 

109
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,724
makes her the more sensuous of the two 
and those certainly a massage artistic 

110
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,624
distinction.
These two women likely represent 

111
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,210
Picasso's wife,
Olga,

112
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,480
and the combination of his mistresses,
Maria Theresa Walter,

113
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
and Dora Maar,
who was with Picasso in on team and 

114
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,944
finally the spearing fishermen can be 
read as Picasso himself or perhaps the 

115
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,420
version of himself that he wants to be 
headstrong,

116
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,930
looking forward at his goals,
undaunted by distraction,

117
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,410
but this man seems to be linked with his
partner,

118
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,303
perhaps Picasso's other half a side of 
himself that is passive that ties a 

119
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,370
fishing line to his toe and weights.

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,360
Whereas the first fisherman is defined 
by strong perpendicular lines.

121
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:51,470
The second body is a mass of curved 
lines and contorted limbs,

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,340
remembering the historical context and 
the stark defiance that is.

123
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,243
Guess what we might be seeing here is 
Picasso coming to grips not only with 

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,890
passivity and weakness in his nature,
but the artists,

125
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,800
impotence in the face of the world's 
brutality.

126
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,300
His mother had died at the start of the 
year in Spain was lost.

127
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,370
Maybe this is why the boat floats in a 
weird no man's land between the town and

128
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,760
the women.
Maybe this is why the scene feels uneasy

129
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,310
despite being beautiful in its 
rendering.

130
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,840
There's more you can read into this 
painting and the rest of Picasso's work,

131
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,093
but these five angles always start me 
down some fruitful paths and each 

132
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:35,450
individual method of understanding is 
less important than the ways all of them

133
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,313
connect and feed into each other.
The historical context usually informs 

134
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,900
the personal and the form grows out of 
the content,

135
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,110
and your first reaction is often 
surprisingly incisive.

136
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,390
If you take the time to voice it or 
write it down,

137
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,763
Picasso's legacy looms so large that the
scholarship on him is fast and often 

138
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,403
contradictory.
So my feeling is why not decide the 

139
00:07:57,681 --> 00:08:00,200
significance of his work for yourself.
