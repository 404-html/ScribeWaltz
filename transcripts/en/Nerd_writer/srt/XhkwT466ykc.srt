1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,980
Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 24 and to 
everybody out there who's new welcome,

2
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:16,963
so there wasn't this Soviet astronomer 
called Nikolai car and he devised a 

3
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:24,530
system for measuring the energy needs of
a civilization on a very broad scale.

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,530
It's called the car dealership scale and
it breaks down like this.

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,603
A type one civilization is one that's 
harness the full power of the planet on 

6
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,104
which it lives,
which is to say a civilization that 

7
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,500
utilizes all the solar,
wind,

8
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,450
nuclear,
etc.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,650
Energy available to it on its home 
planet.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,570
This is mEasured using earth as an 
example,

11
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:45,560
as 10 to the 16th was a type one.
Civilization can control the weather,

12
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,890
it can manipulate basic matter and its 
economy is global.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,873
Now,
a type two civilization is one that has 

14
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:54,200
harnessed all the power from its nearest
store.

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,063
When the planet's energy output becomes 
an equal to the needs of the 

16
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:58,064
civilization,
that civilization will go right to the 

17
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:00,704
source and devise some method for 
collecting the energy from that giant 

18
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:04,604
fusion reactor,
which is his parents start measured 

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,453
using the son as an example,
as four times 10 to the 26th was a type 

20
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:11,510
two.

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,700
Civilization is,
for all intents and purposes,

22
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,620
invincible.
there was nothing known to physics,

23
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,870
not even a super nova,
which can destroy it.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,913
Now a type three civilization,
and this is where it gets cool is one 

25
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,160
that has harnessed all the power of its 
home galaxy,

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,190
which is to say all the many billions of
stars that comprise it,

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,173
sort of like the galactic republic from 
star wars using our milky way as an 

28
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,970
example.
this is measured at four times 10 to the

29
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:35,804
37th watts,
and then there's us human beings from 

30
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:40,040
the planet earth.
We are drum roll please.

31
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:40,874
A Type zero civilization,
which means that we still get the 

32
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:44,324
majority of our energy from dead plants.
How long will it take for us to become 

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,760
type one?
Michio kaku,

34
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:50,594
a physicist who you might've seen on 
every single science channel show has 

35
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:53,414
pretty good that we'll get there 
somewhere in the next 100 to 200 years 

36
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:59,300
and type two and the next house and we 
see the beginnings of that now,

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,163
but there's a problem here and it's,
it's out there in the stars in our 

38
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,490
galaxy,
the milky way galaxy,

39
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,820
which has somewhere between 200 to 400 
billion stars in it.

40
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,043
Common sense seems to tell us that there
has to be intelligent life out there 

41
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,610
somewhere.
Most likely intelligent life,

42
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,444
which is way more advanced than us.
We know that any civilization type two 

43
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:21,290
or above would have an energy signature 
detectable by our instruments,

44
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,320
so the question has to be why don't we 
see them?

45
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,120
There are many possible answers to this 
question,

46
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:29,600
but the one I find most compelling is 
the one most applicable to our situation

47
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:30,434
here on her.
Every intelligent species will go 

48
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:36,020
through the process of discovering the 
elements on the periodic table,

49
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,480
the work systematically from hydrogen on
up,

50
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,314
and eventually they'll come to 
discovering element 92 known to us as 

51
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:44,144
uranium.
This is a very special on earth that 

52
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,270
appears in a few isotopes,
most commonly uranium two,

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,173
38.
Now this consists of 99 point two 

54
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,540
percent of all the uranium that's out 
there,

55
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,540
but there's also uranium 235.

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,650
Now this consists of point seven,
two percent of that's out there,

57
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:02,470
but it's much,
much more valuable.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,333
See,
when you bombard uranium to 35 with a 

59
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,020
free new truck,
you make uranium to 36,

60
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,854
a highly unstable adam,
so unstable that it has to split into 

61
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,380
two lighter elements,
krypton and barium,

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,233
as well as three more free neutrons.
this process is called vision and it 

63
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,240
releases a whole lot of energy.
How much energy?

64
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,074
Well,
there's a handy equation for figuring 

65
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:24,844
that out.
It's simply the mass times the speed of 

66
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,154
light square thing is.
It's very tricky to separate that 

67
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:33,880
uranium 235 from the uranium 238 takes a
lot of time and a lot of money,

68
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,013
but if you can do it,
that remaining uranium to 35 is called 

69
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,520
enriched uranium,
and if you have a good amount of it,

70
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:40,354
well then you've really hit the jackpot.
Remember those three free neutrons 

71
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,340
coming off the original uranium to 36,
adam?

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,353
Well,
they're going to whiz away and bombard 

73
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,000
other uranium 2:35
adams,

74
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,863
turning them into 2:36
is which then split apart again and 

75
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,314
release three free neutrons each.
Now you can either control the speed of 

76
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,200
this chain reaction if you want to 
utilize the power of or something like a

77
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,034
city or you can just let the reaction go
as fast as it once and the result of 

78
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,084
this

79
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,383
on earth.
Only the riChest and smartest countries 

80
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:13,484
have been able to develop a nuclear 
weapon because of the tediousness of 

81
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,514
enriching uranium.
But just last month it was discovered 

82
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,484
that the country of Iran has begun.
That process of enrichment and 

83
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,503
successfully maybe many people want Iran
to stop enriching for fear that they're 

84
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:29,540
building a bomb.
Iran says that's not what it's doing and

85
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,940
that it won't stop,
but people don't seem to believe them.

86
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:34,220
Though I don't have the slightest idea 
why.

87
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,010
It's all very tense right now,
but let me.

88
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,780
Let me bring this back to my point.
See,

89
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,680
when an intelligent species learns to 
enrich uranium element 92,

90
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,790
it all of a sudden gains the power to 
totally destroy its own environment.

91
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,680
In other words,
to destroy itself.

92
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,233
Maybe this is the reason why we don't 
see or hear from other intelligent life 

93
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:54,134
in the cosmos.
Maybe it's because the most critical 

94
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,624
time for any civilization is that 
transition between type zero and type 

95
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:01,040
one.

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,873
A type one civilization is global,
which means that its economy is global 

97
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,430
as well as a large part of its culture.
It has to be tolerant,

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,690
communicative,
pluralistic.

99
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,600
It has to rise above the monocultural,
totalitarian,

100
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,120
often theistic belief in ultimate 
conformity.

101
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,250
In other words,
it has to be peaceful.

102
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,713
We can see that though we possess a lot 
of characteristics of a type one 

103
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:23,030
civilization.
We're not quite there yet.

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,073
Totalitarianism still has it sanctuary.
It may very well be the case that there 

105
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,353
are dozens of earth like planets out 
there with extinct intelligent 

106
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:32,924
civilizations.
Civilizations that failed to negotiate 

107
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,090
that transition between type zero and 
type one.

108
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Civilizations caught up in their own 
weaknesses and if we make it and one day

109
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:48,860
far from now are flying around the 
galaxy and come across one that didn't.

110
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,533
There's no doubt to me that will feel 
the profound a sense of pity because we 

111
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,480
would know that with a little bit of 
knowledge and empathy and courage,

112
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,930
it could've gone the other way.
