1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,980
So today,
today is the day.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,593
It's been said before that being an 
editor is a thankless job because when 

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,230
you do it right,
no one is supposed to notice.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,480
I think this idea goes for Casey 
Neistat's daily Vlog 100 percent.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,880
When Neistat succeeds,
all you should see is the fun.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,160
No,
there are plenty of imitators.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,510
I think it's pretty much impossible to 
duplicate the style of Casey Neistat.

8
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,703
I think that style is worth taking a 
closer look at because along with 

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,453
various other interesting sub genres 
like what we're trying to do with video 

10
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,110
essays,
the daily Vlog,

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,420
particularly what Neistat has done to 
it,

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,040
has grown organically and uniquely out 
of the medium where it lives.

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,650
Online.
Video shouldn't let people do that.

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,190
The inner vitality of Neistat show is 
undeniable.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,670
That's down to his personality.
His worldview is insane.

16
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:12,100
Work Ethic,
even his recklessness,

17
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:16,900
but I think the craft that supports 
these things goes largely unnoticed.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,153
See,
Neistat's revolutionary move was 

19
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:20,524
bringing more than a decade of 
videographic experience to a sub genre 

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,023
that prizes amateur craft daily Vlogs 
need a dose or a feeling of amateurism 

21
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:35,941
because what makes them valuable is how 
real they seem than an age where reality

22
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,024
TV was dominated by Jersey shore and the
hills were scenes were prompted by the 

23
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:44,230
suggestions of producers,
if not completely scripted,

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,870
I don't care about anything else,
but me and Gianni smushing.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Daily vlogs are the response or real 
slice of life with no corporate mediator

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,793
and the signature of something that's 
not corporate is a lack of Polish 

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,293
product that passes through the hands of
only one person before it was delivered 

28
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,850
to an audience.
No audio touchups,

29
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,800
no color correction,
no notes from a distance boardroom.

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,803
Nice.
That elevated that amateur spirit to an 

31
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,790
art,
and I say spirit because I think of what

32
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:17,530
he does is actually amateurish when it 
comes to his vlog on Youtube in general,

33
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,770
was trying to find opportunities to up 
my game.

34
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,280
When it comes to production.
Value Neistat has been slowly developing

35
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,114
his style from the start in 2003.
He and his brother made a short film 

36
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:28,924
called ipod dirty secret about the 
crappiness of Ipod batteries that 

37
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:37,291
collected over a million views in six 
weeks in the era before youtube,

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,770
hybrid combination of Gonzo journalism,
guerrilla filmmaking and cinema verite.

39
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,180
This signature evolved across a number 
of short movies and eventually found its

40
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:50,710
way into the Vlog for which it's a 
perfect match and cinema verite.

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,190
The camera is often acknowledged,
made a part of the product.

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,293
Neistat takes this to another level by 
making his massive collection of camera 

43
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:01,840
equipment and the studio,
another character in his show,

44
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,630
dslrs,
gopros power shots,

45
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,100
three sixties,
iphones,

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,993
drones,
each camera and each lens has its own 

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,010
personality and Neistat's constantly 
swapping them around,

48
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,293
but it goes further than this nice that 
keeps all his old footage routinely 

49
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,780
working in mini dv memories,
vhs tapes,

50
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,710
and other first generation video camera 
clips within this universe.

51
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,080
Old Video camera footage doesn't look 
dated.

52
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,973
It's just another strata and the ongoing
story of the democratization of 

53
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,430
filmmaking story that parallels our 
lives.

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,900
His main rig,
however,

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,320
is this a Canon Seventy d on a gorilla 
pod.

56
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,473
I mean,
this tells you everything you need to 

57
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,254
know about neistat stat as a filmmaker,
this is a heavy thing to carry all day 

58
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,400
daily vloggers before this may do with 
handheld,

59
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,234
so varying sizes,
powershot small enough to fit in your 

60
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,174
pocket.

61
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,940
The idea was that it was always with you
on obtrusive.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,100
Neistat has a slightly different emo.
He wants to show to feel natural,

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,400
not be natural.
My goal with this blog isn't,

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,120
and it has never been to like share all 
the intimacies of my life.

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,253
It's always just been to create a good 
or entertaining piece of content every 

66
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,444
day and so to up his production value 
takes a million little things like 

67
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,670
setting a camera down,
framing a shot,

68
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,730
then running back out of frame to come 
into frame again,

69
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,280
like the shot I showed at the beginning 
of this video,

70
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,950
like going out at sunset and waiting 30 
minutes.

71
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,784
Well,
three different cameras take three 

72
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:33,220
different timelapses like carrying a 70 
d on a gorilla pot all day,

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,083
like carrying a 70 d and a gorilla pod 
and a boosted board controller all in 

74
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,360
the same hand.
Just to look natural.

75
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,283
I'm trying to eat sean,
how to ride the boosted board record 

76
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,730
with a video camera and drink a smoothie
at the same time.

77
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:46,690
How's it going,
John?

78
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,860
The effortlessness of Casey Neistat's.
Flog is an illusion.

79
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,813
The next time you watch one,
just pay more attention to his camera 

80
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,840
setups.
Notice how things are framed.

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,250
Notice how his timelapses always feature
some sort of large movement.

82
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,920
Notice how edits through action feels so
smooth,

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,340
and then think about what actually was 
happening there.

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,233
There are a lot of things on youtube,
but only a few of them are legitimately 

85
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,524
something new under the sun.
These new styles cultivated not from 

86
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,263
film or TV,
but out of how we watch and share 

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,593
specifically online video,
have to be acknowledged and studied and 

88
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,124
celebrate it.
If we want this medium to be recognized 

89
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,080
as something other than the stepchild of
older formats,

90
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,680
I get a thrill watching Neistat's work.
I'm motivated by it,

91
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,460
by the art that's in it,
and how wonderfully visible it can be.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,473
It's a style you can't duplicate because
the show is animated and held together 

93
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,560
by his energy,
but that ought to be encouraging because

94
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,600
it means that in the age of online 
video,

95
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,500
when a creation can be the unmediated 
vision of its creator,

96
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,850
there's the style within all of us and 
there are millions of people waiting for

97
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:00,980
you to find it.

98
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,710
Yes,
I'm starting a proper daily blog.

99
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm site.

100
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,540
There is a new nerdwriter video every 
Wednesday,

101
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,374
so if you go right there and click that,
you'll subscribe and get all the videos 

102
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,310
and that really helps me out.
Um,

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,690
I want to tell you guys about a channel 
that I really love called wisecrack.

104
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,040
They do shows like eight bit philosophy,
earthlings,

105
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,770
cinema,
thug notes,

106
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,604
which is my favorite probably.
You can go right there and watch a 

107
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,880
video.
Subscribe if you like it.

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,950
You like the nerd writer,
you're going to like them.

109
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,750
So they're awesome.
Check that out.

110
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,780
I'll see you guys all next Wednesday for
something new.

111
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,973
Oh,
and by the way.
