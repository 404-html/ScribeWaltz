1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,210
Would you care for someone for sure have
to do just answer my questions with.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,370
Okay.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,913
A few years ago,
a friend and I went to the scientology 

4
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,590
complex in Los Angeles to see what the 
religion was all about.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,603
We were curious.
I talked about it actually one of the 

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,190
first episodes of the show.
We were touring around the facility,

7
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:30,630
introduced to some very nice members and
given personality tests.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,733
The test,
which is officially called the Oxford 

9
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,254
capacity analysis,
though it has no connection with Oxford 

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,060
University or any accredited 
institution,

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,000
was more intense than I thought it was 
going to be.

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:42,834
An included about 200 questions.
A few of which are actually reproduced 

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,190
exactly in this scene from Paul Thomas 
Anderson.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,940
20 12 film the master do linger in bus 
stations for pleasure.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,190
You muscles precedents for no reason to 
past failures bother you.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,740
Would you like to be told what to do?
Do you find interest in other people?

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,780
I often consumed my scientific usually 
truthful to other unpredictable.

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,103
Yeah.
This processing scene from the master 

19
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:15,470
is,
in my opinion,

20
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,620
one of the best sequences in one of the 
best movies of the last 10 years.

21
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,110
It's simple,
brilliantly acted and hypnotic,

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,100
which is no mistake on the part of the 
filmmakers if you're interested.

23
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,943
The scene offers some real insights into
how the religion of scientology 

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,633
functions.
Though PT Anderson has always been 

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,213
careful to say that the master is not an
exact retelling of scientology's 

26
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,980
founding.
The similarities in character,

27
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:40,610
feeling and technique are hard to deny.
For example,

28
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,444
this scene,
the processing seen bears an 

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,753
unmistakable resemblance to a vital 
activity within scientology called 

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,953
auditing.
The term auditing comes from a word 

31
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:53,540
which means to listen in auditing.
The person running the session is called

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,433
the auditor.
The person receiving auditing is called 

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,290
a pre clear because he has not yet been 
cleared of his reactive mind.

34
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,020
In the master seen Lancaster Dod played 
by Philip Seymour.

35
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:06,620
Hoffman is the auditor and Freddie 
played by Joaquin Phoenix.

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,663
Is the pre clear like dod does here.
The auditor in scientology asks 

37
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:13,430
questions of the pre clear with the goal
of reading him,

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,293
of Ngrams,
the term for traumatic memories stored 

39
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,564
in what's called the reactive mind.
The auditor does this by helping the 

40
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,960
preclearance relive the experience that 
caused the trauma.

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,860
When the pre-cleared has a cognition or 
a positive realization,

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,023
the session is completed.
If this seems a little like 

43
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,860
psychoanalysis to you,
that's because it is.

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,080
When l Ron Hubbard,
the founder of scientology,

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,630
laid down these methods in his book 
dianetics.

46
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,980
I think he genuinely believed that he 
had devised a new kind of psychotherapy,

47
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:46,400
something that was scientifically 
rigorous and effective.

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,480
Of course,
as we know,

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,150
dianetics is not scientifically 
rigorous.

50
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:50,984
It has been repeatedly rejected by all 
mental health communities as a 

51
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,490
pseudoscience,
which it is,

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,383
but as we see in the master,
there's no doubt that the process of 

53
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,410
auditing can cause and effect.

54
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,503
Where's your mother infringement back to
this time in the processing seen dod 

55
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,364
gets ready to admit to a series of past 
traumas including the death of his 

56
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,770
father,
the institutionalization of his mother,

57
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,604
his incestuous relationship with an aunt
and the Times that he killed people in 

58
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,950
war.
He uses these to access the primary end,

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,793
Graham of the session,
Freddy's abandonment of the love of his 

60
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,860
life back home,
like in psychoanalysis dot achieves this

61
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,070
by talking,
by initiating and exchange that attempts

62
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,670
to unlock things that are repressed or 
hard to face,

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but the methods used are different as as
long been believed by.

64
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,834
It's critics.
Scientology auditing goes further than 

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,080
psychoanalysis or talk therapy because 
it utilizes a form of command.

66
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,570
GNOSIS.
Say Your name.

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,470
Say it again,
Freddy.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,290
Well say it again.
Freddy quilt and again Friday.

69
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,173
Quell.
All throughout the dod works to bring 

70
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:02,814
Freddy under his command and the first 
part which is structured a lot like the 

71
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:06,594
personality test.
He asks them a series of relatively 

72
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:09,654
simple yes or no questions getting 
freddy used to this call and response 

73
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:16,920
pattern.
Utilizing repetition to induce a relaxed

74
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:21,580
and focused state.
In past failures bother you know,

75
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,300
do your past failures.

76
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,323
No.

77
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,400
Do you pass values bother you?

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,050
No.
Do your past failures in life either you

79
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,320
repetition also signals toward important
status,

80
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,060
trying to get freddy to unconsciously 
focus on his past failures.

81
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,710
After this brief mini session ends,
Freddy insists on more and data degrees,

82
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:47,544
but this time with the caveat that 
Freddy can't blink or the round of 

83
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,020
questioning,
we'll start again from the beginning.

84
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,580
This extra strain occupies Freddy's 
conscious mind and with the priming from

85
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:57,414
the first part established,
he begins to answer the questions with 

86
00:04:59,131 --> 00:04:59,964
more openness and candor I've ever had 
intercourse with someone inside your 

87
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:03,740
family?
Yes.

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,593
Have you ever had intercourse with 
someone inside your family had been 

89
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,483
killed?
Anyone?

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,570
No.
Maybe not me.

91
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,543
Have you killed anyone?
Know How many times did you have 

92
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,630
intercourse with your hand?
Three times,

93
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,673
whereas no.
I don't know what you'd like to have 

94
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:21,864
intercourse with her.
Again,

95
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,283
with the patterns set dot increases the 
intensity and increases the intensity 

96
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:30,100
and increases the intensity to such a 
pitch that freddy is visibly tensing up.

97
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,090
Then at the most charged moment,
dot breaks the pattern and asks,

98
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,470
ready to close his eyes.

99
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,050
The emotion of this moment is real 
dislike.

100
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,093
Hypnosis is real.
Just like psychotherapy and 

101
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,554
psychoanalysis are real.
Let's because cognitive activity is 

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,233
real.
It can be harnessed and manipulated and 

103
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:02,360
projected and seen from new angles.
Auditing is at the center of Scientology

104
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
because it can produce these feelings of
epiphany that convinced people that the 

105
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,770
methods which achieve it must be 
correct.

106
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,503
That's the danger of scientology to mean
hypnotherapy is a valid form of 

107
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,160
treatment for those who want to seek it 
out,

108
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,470
but scientology flatly denies that 
auditing utilizes any hypnosis at all,

109
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,763
so the people like Freddy,
who experienced it unknowingly are 

110
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,144
susceptible to coercive suggestion.
Whether it's done maliciously or by 

111
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:30,734
someone not properly trained.
It can be persuaded to believe that the 

112
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,334
church is right with a capital r and 
thus deserves all the time and money 

113
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,110
they're asked.
To give it.

114
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,280
To make it clear all you have to do a 
show fellow that he's mocking up his own

115
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,800
mind,
bear for his own difficulties,

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,240
and that he is not a completely adrift 
in am swamped by a body,

117
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,550
and there he is.
You've got to clear.

118
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,783
Hubbard held that auditing like we see 
in the master was the way to quote 

119
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:09,070
unquote clear every single person on 
earth when that's your claim,

120
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,933
there can be no uncertainty in your 
methods when uncertainty is the one 

121
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:16,870
thing that binds all forms of mental 
health.

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,960
We don't understand all the ways the 
mind works,

123
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:20,794
probably we never will,
but psychotherapy and psychiatry 

124
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,304
functioning within a scientific 
community within a code of ethics that 

125
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:28,084
protects from abuse as made advances,
that can help those who are struggling 

126
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,260
to cope with life.
It's not perfect,

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,610
but it's a hell of a lot better than 
scientology.

128
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,843
No.

129
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,000
