1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,550
This is the death of socrates by shock.
Louis divvied completed in 1787.

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,350
It is an exemplar of the neoclassical 
period in France which divvied virtually

3
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:27,620
created and brought to the fore himself.
Before I say more,

4
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,950
it's important to note just how striking
this canvas is,

5
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,880
not knowing anything about it,
so much jumps out at me right away.

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,893
The clarity of the scene,
the fierce gesture of the man in the 

7
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,164
middle,
the interplay of the Chalice and the 

8
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,030
hand that reaches for it,
the angles of the light and the men,

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,290
the soft draping,
garments bear flat stone wall.

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,693
As the title suggests,
the scene depicts the death of socrates 

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,390
told famously by Plato in his dialogue 
on the soul,

12
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,343
the Fito.
Socrates had been convicted in Athenian 

13
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,434
Court of failing to acknowledge the gods
of the city and corrupting the city's 

14
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:07,640
youth and sentenced to death by drinking
hemlock.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,100
As Plato makes clear in another 
dialogue,

16
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,670
the crito.
Socrates could have escaped into exile,

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,713
but instead he chooses to die.
Taking the opportunity to teach his 

18
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:22,580
final lesson that death is not to be 
feared by the philosopher,

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,760
but embraced as an apotheosis of the 
soul divvied chooses to paint the moment

20
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,114
just as socrates is grabbing for the 
poison draft he's been discussing at 

21
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:34,004
length the immortality of the soul and 
doesn't even seem to care that he's 

22
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:40,460
about to take the implement of his death
in hand.

23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,690
On the contrary,
socrates is defined gesturing toward the

24
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,524
afterlife,
to which he hastens divvied idealizes 

25
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:49,424
him.
Socrates would have been 70 at the time 

26
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:54,950
in somewhat less muscular and beautiful 
than painted here.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,993
The raking light coming in from the top 
left pours onto socrates the brightest 

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,770
figure in the tablo.
The colors are muted at the sides,

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,753
become vivid in the center with the 
executioner in red and socrates in 

30
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:09,110
white.

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,200
For Davita.
Socrates is a symbol of strength,

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,093
over passion,
of STOIC commitment to an abstract 

33
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,900
principle,
even in the face of death.

34
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,173
This is the ethical message divvied 
sought to offer the French two years 

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,803
before the French revolution,
as the monarchy was in decline and 

36
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:30,230
reformers ache to install a democracy 
akin to that.

37
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:34,220
Of Socrates own time in Greek antiquity 
or of the United States,

38
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,090
which had just executed its own 
revolution five years prior,

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,073
indeed Thomas Jefferson himself was 
present at the unveiling of this 

40
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:42,704
painting at the salon of 1787.
The image commissioned by two radical 

41
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:47,594
political reformers was wildly popular,
divvied had already made his name with 

42
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:52,724
another severe moralistic canvas,
the oath of the ratio which effectively 

43
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:57,824
invented the neoclassical taking its 
cues from the stark simplicity of 

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,553
ancient Greece and Rome from the ancient
obsession with anatomy and musculature 

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,383
from the two dimensional freezes 
depicting historical events 

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,240
neoclassicism as rendered by divvied 
made its points strongly and severely.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,200
This was in direct opposition to the 
dominant Rococo style that reflected the

48
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,230
ornate and hedonistic lifestyles of the 
monarchy in the horatio pie.

49
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,083
As in the death of socrates.
Those dedicated to principal are 

50
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,594
depicted with angular geometry.
While those ruled by passion are curved 

51
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,340
and weak in both canvases,
the backgrounds are flat,

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,880
fixing attention on the foreground where
like a freeze,

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,520
the action can be read from site to 
site.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,593
One way to read the death of socrates is
right to left the anguish of socrates 

55
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,214
followers,
curling and twisting opens up onto the 

56
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,814
comm expression of the man himself and 
flows down through his right arm which 

57
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,040
hovers over the cup of poison,
the space between the hand and the cup.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,220
The exact center of the image is the 
seat of maximum narrative charge.

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,370
Then it falls back into the pain of the 
man who delivers the poison,

60
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,383
who turns his gaze away from socrates 
and finally comes to rest on the man 

61
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,730
sitting at the foot of the bed,
unengaged were on him in a moment.

62
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,640
Davita doesn't identify anyone in the 
painting,

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,820
but we can infer from accounts of 
socrates actual death.

64
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,360
That in the background is socrates.
Wife is an anthropy,

65
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,890
led away in distress and collecting.
Socrates leg is cryto,

66
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,970
his oldest and most faithful student 
under credo.

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,410
We can see that divvied has signed his 
own name,

68
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,440
signaling a feeling of connection with 
the man divvied weaker than his ideal of

69
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,590
moral strength.
Nonetheless grabs and strives toward it.

70
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,783
The painter has taken a number of 
liberties with history besides altering 

71
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,863
socrates face and physique divvied 
decreases the number of people present 

72
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,064
at the event from over 15 to 12 echoing 
the number of disciples at De Vinci's 

73
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,374
last supper,
but I think the most significant change 

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,600
is that the addition of the character at
the foot of the bed.

75
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,853
This is plato,
the man who popularized socrates 

76
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,604
teachings by staging him as the 
protagonists in over 30 philosophical 

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,890
dialogues put simply without plato,
there would be no socrates.

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,710
The two men melt into each other 
historically.

79
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:24,544
It's hard to determine where socrates 
philosophy ends and Plato's begins not 

80
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,330
only was plato absent at the death of 
socrates,

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,060
but he was a young man at the time here 
at Davita,

82
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,923
has some as old and withdrawn.
I said earlier that you can read the 

83
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,644
canvas from right to left,
but you can also read it from left to 

84
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,540
right.
The whole scene,

85
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,403
it seems to me,
appears to explode out of the back of 

86
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:51,220
Plato's head,
recontextualizing it as a memory,

87
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,173
an idealized memory in which socrates 
gestures in the exact same way he does 

88
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,320
in Rafael's school.
Of Athens significantly,

89
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,243
Plato is positioned apart from the flat 
background where the frozen lateral 

90
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,560
moment gives way to the depth of time.
In reality,

91
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,610
it strikes me that this is the way 
memories often fall out.

92
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,820
Restaged with smooth edges and perfect 
light,

93
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,890
two dimensional,
idealized,

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,960
painstakingly arranged to serve the 
needs of the present in the character of

95
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:24,794
Plato.
The rigorous ethical reality of the 

96
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,374
scene is betrayed by its own self 
awareness as a construction and in only 

97
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,493
a few short years,
the noble ideals of the French 

98
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
Revolution will be betrayed as well by 
the terror that is to follow.

99
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,570
Maybe this is why almost prophetically 
divvied signs his name here,

100
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,610
a second time neoclassicism like this 
may seem severe and blunt,

101
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,743
but so much is happening in David's 
death of socrates and interplay of 

102
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,150
historical,
personal,

103
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,013
political and aesthetic elements 
rendered forcefully suddenly and 

104
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,990
beautifully put.
Another way,

105
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,480
it's a work of genius.

106
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,950
