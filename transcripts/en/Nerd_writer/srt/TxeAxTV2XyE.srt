1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,390
Flavor that I didn't find any other 
grand.

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,060
Try Camels and see

3
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,250
and point at the first men came to 
western.

4
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,250
Mine had this invention where he's 
actually almost.

5
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,870
It was like mythical or something,
but anyway,

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,704
it was this chamber under ground where 
you could go and hear everything that 

7
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:45,490
anyone had ever said about you behind 
your back,

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,383
but in order to get to the best thing 
which was at the like the lower most 

9
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:54,280
chamber,
you had to start at the worst insult and

10
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,143
work your way down.
My friend always used to say he could 

11
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:00,730
never make it two steps,
but I don't know.

12
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:01,564
I think I could make it to the bottom.
Maybe that's because I have a poor 

13
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,970
imagination.
Do you guys have.

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,760
It is simply not pleasant to be 
objectively observed.

15
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,490
It's like seeing a candid photo of 
yourself online,

16
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:22,324
not smiling or posing,
but simply looking the way you will 

17
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:28,510
apparently always do oblivious and Bush 
face with your mouth open.

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,553
It's proof that we are visible to others
that we are seeing in all are naked 

19
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:37,750
silliness and stupid.
A group of friends.

20
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,584
I think it's inevitable you're going to 
spend time talking with one another 

21
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,484
about one another behind one another's 
backs and it's not always going to be 

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,760
nice thing,
but I think it can be healthy.

23
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:49,594
Your friends are never going to be so 
perfect that they don't act like an 

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,650
idiot sometimes or repeat their own 
mistakes or do other things which are so

25
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,484
clearly against their interests and I 
think it's healthy to vent to other 

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,260
mutual friends about how aggravating and
crazy this person can be if for nothing,

27
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:12,280
but to ensure that in this instance,
the crazy one isn't you.

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,780
First of all,
brands don't talk behind your back.

29
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,980
So one thing is when people talk behind 
your back,

30
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:22,630
it really shows you what kind of 
friendly.

31
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:27,631
Our first thing to remember is that if 
anyone talks behind your back,

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,210
they're probably doing because they're 
jealous.

33
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,903
Other day at lunch,
I was part of a whole group of 

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,733
colleagues,
colleagues in my school and who were 

35
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,800
talking behind our bosses back.

36
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,760
I mean like,
seriously.

37
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:46,250
It just is like isn't necessary.
It's not.

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,290
It's not necessary.

39
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,360
We're talking behind someone's back.
Ken,

40
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,203
just be plain Shitty,
especially when you're trying to gain 

41
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,490
the favor of one friend at the expense 
of another,

42
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,383
these purely negative gossip or the 
kinds of talk that we should try our 

43
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,800
best to avoid and speak up against when 
we hear it began.

44
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,703
As kreider says,
the operative fallacy here is that we 

45
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,944
believe that unconditional love means 
not seeing anything negative about 

46
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:37,654
someone,
but usually the fact that friends talk 

47
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:39,994
behind other friends backs is precisely 
because they have a stake in the 

48
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,974
friendship and spend a lot of time 
thinking about this person whom they 

49
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,144
love.
Talking with friends about friends like 

50
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,880
talking with friends is the important 
work of French.

51
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,743
Just like telling a friend that you love
them is as important as telling another 

52
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,020
friend that you told your friend that 
you love them.

53
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:06,280
So much of what we tell others is what 
we want for ourselves.

54
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,310
Does it have to be as circuitous as 
this?

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,800
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

56
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:18,300
This is great.
Oh,

57
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,970
that friend who his name is Jake.
Just a friend of mine.

58
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,030
He's a great guy.
Learn your instruments.

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,640
You want me to dance as well?
It's a beautiful dance for them.

60
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,630
For the electric guitar lesson.
