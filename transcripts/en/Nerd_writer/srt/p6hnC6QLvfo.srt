00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,480
Have you ever heard a word for the first
time a word like,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,403
I dunno corpuscular,
which by the way is an adjective 

3
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:09,314
describing twilight,
and then the next day you see 

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,494
corpuscular again in a novel and then 
you see it again the next day in your 

5
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,070
biology textbook and you start to 
wonder,

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,113
how is it possible that I've gone the 
first 20 years of my life without ever 

7
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,690
seeing the word corpuscular and now in 
the last week,

8
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,524
I've seen crepuscular three times.
I know I've experienced this strong 

9
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,500
feeling of coincidence before many 
times,

10
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,334
and there's a name for it.
It's called the Baader Meinhof 

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,173
phenomenon.
Nobody really knows why it's called 

12
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,020
that.
The baader Meinhof group was a late 20th

13
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:44,830
century leftwing millet infection from 
west Germany.

14
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:45,664
It's likely that the person who gave it 
that name just happened to be awash in 

15
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,190
coincidentally baader Meinhof 
references.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,430
The more scientific name for this 
phenomenon is the frequency illusion,

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,890
and it's just another example of our old
friend,

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,770
the cognitive bias at work.

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,730
See,
when we see something for the first time

20
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:05,750
and then many times directly thereafter,
it can lead us to believe that there's a

21
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,600
greater synchronicity at work in the 
world around us.

22
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,434
Perhaps it's an artifact of determinism,
the feeling that everything happens for 

23
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:13,994
a reason.
The coincidence we feel is just too 

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,083
astronomically unlikely,
but of course the truth is that most 

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,150
bordering on all things don't happen for
a reason despite our intuition that they

26
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,084
do,
and yet it's just that intuition 

27
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,274
activated in the Baader Meinhof 
phenomenon that gives us an interesting 

28
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,204
look into the machinery of the mind.
Our brains are essentially pattern 

29
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:40,490
recognizing superheroes,
able to find meaning in countless pieces

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,400
of data,
whether it's our ability to see words in

31
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:47,780
a newspaper word search or to work out 
through fine mathematics,

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,720
the natural laws of the universe for 
this reason,

33
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:51,554
stimuli which are excited sort of sit 
and wait at the fore of the brain for 

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
similar stimuli with which to identify a
pattern.

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,280
In other words,
you may have seen the word corpuscular a

36
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:05,610
number of times in your life,
but your brain just wasn't interested.

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,140
The frequency illusion is augmented by 
two other phenomenon.

38
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,820
First,
the recency effect,

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,673
a cognitive bias that inflates the 
importance of recent stimuli or 

40
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,280
observations,
and second,

41
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,383
by the confirmation bias,
which in this case is precisely your 

42
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:21,344
belief that you're seeing this new thing
all over the place and the frequency 

43
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:25,664
illusion can become confirmation bias 
when our passive experience of 

44
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,210
repeatedly seeing a new thing turns into
an active search for still more examples

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,713
of the magic that summons,
but what's more interesting to me about 

46
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:42,140
this phenomenon is not the coincidence 
is that you think you see,

47
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,183
but all the patterns that are zipping by
in your day to day life that you don't 

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,743
register at all.
The baader Meinhof illusion proves that 

49
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:52,880
we only see the things that we're 
looking out for.

50
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,280
This can be bad in the case of 
confirmation bias,

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,413
but it also goes to show how ignorance 
can be maintained through a lack of 

52
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,263
active learning.
The more you prime your mind by reading 

53
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:04,504
and writing to see new patterns,
the more reality will unfold before you 

54
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,440
as an extraordinary mechanism of natural
laws.

55
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,441
The more humanity will show itself to be
an empathetic and beautiful mess of self

56
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,614
delusions and cognitive biases.
I could end this video like everybody 

57
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,900
else who writes articles about this 
subject does.

58
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,340
By saying that you'll probably see the 
Baader Meinhof phenomenon again sometime

59
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,174
soon,
but of course those people weren't 

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,110
talking about the Baader Meinhof 
phenomenon.

61
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:37,111
Merely as a ruse to get you to take more
notice of the word crepuscular

62
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,870
[inaudible].
That's what I was doing.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,450
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

64
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,710
Sorry I was a little bit late last week 
with the video.

65
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,544
I was traveling all over God's creation.
I just didn't have the time to finish 

66
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,324
it.
I was wondering if you like the 

67
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:52,990
understanding art house feature that I 
did last week.

68
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,183
It's a little bit different,
but I was thinking of doing it as a 

69
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,970
series sprinkled in between other 
videos.

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,080
Tell me what you think.
Also,

71
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,750
I sort of like putting out the video on 
Monday.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,600
I might continue to do that instead of 
Friday.

73
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
I don't know.
I just feel like it gives more 

74
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,280
opportunity for people to see it.
The weekend people usually check out.

75
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,810
Let me know what you think about that as
well.

76
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,950
Follow me on Tumbler and twitter.
Discussed this video in the comments and

77
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,784
post this on reddit.
If you have any heart at all for me and 

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,010
continuing to do this and I love you so 
much for that,

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,960
I will see you next time.
