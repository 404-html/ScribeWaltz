1
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,030
As we race towards more sophisticated 
forms of virtual reality,

2
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,923
it's worth considering the work of 
Stanley Kubrick who spent his career 

3
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,124
probing and solving the questions of 
immersive storytelling in ways that 

4
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,270
still remain unique more than any other 
director.

5
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:46,271
It's easy to imagine Kubrick's films as 
worlds that we could explore as games or

6
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:51,461
even virtual reality rides where we've 
glide through narrative spaces intensely

7
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:53,630
involved,
but never in control.

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,980
This is because cooper was as much 
concerned with the way audiences engaged

9
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:01,310
with his movies as he was with the ideas
that they were trying to convey.

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,570
In fact,
for Kubrick,

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,910
these two things were inseparably 
linked.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,940
We often think of Cooper as a highly 
stylized director,

13
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:08,774
which he was a crucially.
Kubrick never lets us forget what the 

14
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:12,674
purpose of style actually is.
Style is a lens that gives the viewer a 

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,620
point of access to the material.

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,380
It's about the audience,
not the director.

17
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,080
Something that new filmmakers should 
keep in mind.

18
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,063
Today,
I want to take a closer look at eyes 

19
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,104
wide shut Kubrick's final film and the 
ways it immerses us in the story of 

20
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,060
Alice and especially Dr.
Bill Hartford,

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,440
a married couple going through a 
difficult time in their relationship,

22
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,363
and this isn't the first film to deal 
with subjects of love or sex infidelity 

23
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:41,354
or even secret colts,
but Kubrick is intent on making our 

24
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:46,340
engagement with these things.
One of a kind.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,290
How does he do that?
Well,

26
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,213
the first and most noticeable aspect of 
eyes wide shut is definitely it's 

27
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,574
strange pacing.
It's a slow moving on the level of 

28
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:57,620
narrative,
but especially in the dialogue.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,310
Listening to Tom Cruise and Nicole 
Kidman speak is like watching a dripping

30
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:02,144
faucet.
Every word drops out of their mouths 

31
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:07,560
with the same lifeless rhythm.
Look,

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,153
women don't.
They basically just don't think like 

33
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,060
that.
If you see exhaustion in their faces and

34
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:18,894
hear it in their voices,
that's because they really were 

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,983
exhausted.
Kubrick made his actors to countless 

36
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,414
takes of every scene,
including the ones where they had to 

37
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,084
break down and cry.
This is the reason why eyes wide shut 

38
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,950
holds the Guinness record for the 
longest movie shoot ever,

39
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,610
but it's also the reason for these 
utterly unique performances.

40
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,160
Something beyond tired.
Beyond Giddy,

41
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:41,100
that state of Dreamy Detachment Kubrick 
was going for,

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,773
and

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,350
now this accomplishes two things.
First,

44
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,600
it adds to the hypnotic tone of the 
film.

45
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,700
Eyes wide shut is based a novella called
dream story,

46
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:01,534
and the film certainly plays out like a 
dream or drugged up hallucination and 

47
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,870
second,
the detached performances serve to block

48
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,140
the lead characters from being targets 
of the viewers.

49
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,974
Empathy,
that makes for a really interesting 

50
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:13,774
combination.
Let me explain why from the moment bill 

51
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:16,534
leaves the house after Alice gives a 
long wounding speech about her fantasy 

52
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,584
of sleeping with another man.
The narrative conspires across a series 

53
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,484
of increasingly sexualized encounters to
deeply involve you in the unfolding 

54
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,340
events.
First,

55
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,450
the patient's daughter confesses her 
love to bill.

56
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,523
Then bill hires a prostitute.
Then bill meets an old friend at a cafe 

57
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,380
who tells him about a secret sex party 
later that night,

58
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,340
then at a costume shop after hours,
bill witnesses the owners,

59
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,770
young daughter sleeping with two 
businessmen,

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,890
and finally bill arrives at the sex 
part,

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,800
which is much more intense than he 
anticipated.

62
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,430
All this time you're experiencing the 
night from the perspective of bill,

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,600
but not from a position of empathy or 
even sympathy for that matter.

64
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,733
Instead,
the viewer engages in what philosopher 

65
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,774
Alessandra Anelli calls experiential 
identification in which the result of 

66
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:06,634
occupying bill's perspective,
while not empathizing with him is that 

67
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,804
the perspective becomes your own.
It's really as if the viewer is playing 

68
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,920
a virtual reality game of eyes wide 
shut.

69
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,100
This explains why we react to the orgy 
sequence with such intensity,

70
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:24,000
cooper leads us down beat by beat to 
this moment with precision.

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,073
We've been pulled so far into the dream 
that the simple act of bill putting on 

72
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:31,620
his mask or racing his identity 
completely is for the viewer a moment of

73
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:34,320
deeper immersion.
Then the best vr

74
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,790
from that moment on the experience of 
the party is as much ours as it is,

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,624
bills.
There are plenty of things that Kubrick 

76
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:01,410
does visually here to draw you in as he 
does in his other movies,

77
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:04,740
like using wide angle lenses or 
switching to pov shots.

78
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:07,680
Most of which are unfortunately too 
explicit for me to show.

79
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,783
But what sets eyes wide shut apart is 
this systematic effort to swap you in 

80
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,720
for the protagonist.
This is what the whole movie visuals,

81
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:18,750
narrative,
dialogue and character works together to

82
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,584
accomplish the masked ball orgy scene 
takes place exactly halfway through the 

83
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,740
movie,
but you're captured in its world for the

84
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,510
remaining hour.
What exactly happened?

85
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,650
How did you let yourself get in so deep?
You're questions are the same as bills,

86
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,360
and as the two of you attempt to piece 
together,

87
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,430
the answer is like a dream.
Half remembered.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,713
Nothing comes up,
clear bill can't reach his patient's 

89
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:39,570
starter.

90
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,570
He can't find his friend,
Nick Knight and and when he goes back to

91
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:44,730
the home of the prostitute,
she's gone.

92
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,640
Even at the costume shop,
things have completely changed.

93
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,060
Nothing quite make sense.
You were going to call the police.

94
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,180
Whoa.
Things change.

95
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,073
The information that you can piece 
together tells a story that's dark and 

96
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,510
haunting.
I noticed Mr.

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Nightingale had a bruise on his cheek 
and to be perfectly honest,

98
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,860
I also thought you looked a bit scared.
Then at the end,

99
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:09,694
Sydney Pollack suddenly appears again 
mirroring his appearance at the 

100
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,953
beginning of the film as an 
authoritative voice to offer an 

101
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,890
explanation that paints a more innocent 
picture.

102
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,240
You just might.
I have the wrong idea.

103
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,920
By the one or two things,

104
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,743
you know,
Cooper died only a few days after 

105
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:37,360
completing the final edit of eyes wide 
shut.

106
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,643
By that time in his career,
a lot of people had written and said a 

107
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:43,420
lot of things about his work.
People are still doing it.

108
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,930
I'm doing it right now,
but the viewer is who cooper cared about

109
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:47,764
most and he or she stands were bill.
Hartford stands in between the artist's 

110
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,660
intention,
critics,

111
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,494
interpretation,
and the actual experience of the movie 

112
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,430
itself.
Eyes Wide Shut,

113
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:58,264
I think is an ode to the experience,
to the raw impression of seeing 

114
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,044
something marvelous Kubrick drags you 
into the movie plants you edit center 

115
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,500
and challenges you to figure out what 
happened.

116
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,470
He was a stylist,
but his style was for us.

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,960
He made some of the best movies of all 
time.

118
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,810
More importantly,
he taught us how to watch them.

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,100
