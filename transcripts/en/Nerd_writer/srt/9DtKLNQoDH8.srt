1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,100
Welcome to my home.
We're gonna.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,760
Answer some questions for you today.
I got all your questions from the video.

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,594
You asked a lot of good stuff.
We're going to go through them for my 

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:09,840
helper.
For this video.

5
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,220
We're going to use my sister,
Sydney,

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,300
the lovely Sydney Boucek.
You can call her the kidney and uh,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,880
yeah.
So coffee on a Tuesday and 52.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,400
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,533
Alright.
You guys asked a lot of great questions 

10
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:34,740
here.
Um,

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,573
we're going to go through a couple of 
them are going to answer as many as we 

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,434
can,
as quickly as we can and hopefully we 

13
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:39,984
can get through as many as possible.
Who is your favorite philosopher and 

14
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,090
why?
Albert [inaudible].

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,940
Albert can move the myth,
the myth of sisyphus and the rebel.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,250
Those are the two that really have 
influenced me.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,113
The most name,
some not so popular youtube channels 

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,600
that you would recommend.
Well,

19
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,490
I have one chip.
So popular.

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,413
I have one channel that I,
that's really not so popular that I 

21
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,770
think you guys would love.
It's called Nick Pucek.

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,430
Oh yes.
Next check.

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,700
Check it out.
Or Dad does a youtube channel.

24
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,800
He makes sand castles in the,
um,

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,080
in the summer,
just just subscribed to them.

26
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,960
It'll make them happy sports.
This is what I got to say about that.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,853
Oh,
love

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,230
is your favorite book you've read in the
past year.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,690
The fault in our stars.
Any advice for someone who is,

30
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,200
for lack of a better term,
still searching for what they love.

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,120
I think that if people have a passion 
for something that may not,

32
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,493
for example,
writing that's not going to pay the 

33
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,410
bills,
that they just,

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,303
they don't do it.
It might not pay the bills that might 

35
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,850
not pay the bills.
They don't do it.

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,240
And then they just go for the job.
That's gonna pay the bills.

37
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,530
So

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,893
yeah,
I think there's a lot of hobbies that 

39
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:50,070
you get that you think that,
that you just sort of enjoy.

40
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:50,904
You think you could never turn it into a
career just because of the way that you 

41
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:57,300
were raised with the way that you think.
Everything that you do that you love can

42
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:00,420
be turned into a career if you do it 
creatively.

43
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:05,010
Enough of the ancient Greek philosophers
who was the most awesome and why Plato,

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,903
because he was the best writer.
How is your brain the way your mind 

45
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,730
works and your worldview different now 
than when you were 18?

46
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,783
Because now you're 24.
I think the big difference between the 

47
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,260
difference I think is that now I am 
willing to be wrong,

48
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,050
to make someone happy,
whereas when I was 18,

49
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,410
I was obsessed with being right and the 
truth.

50
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,244
So true.
So now I think the best thing that you 

51
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
can do,
you are.

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,093
You always had to be right.
The best thing that you can do and 

53
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,224
learn,
the hardest thing to learn is that 

54
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:42,360
sometimes it's right to be wrong.
If it makes the other person happy.

55
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,690
Were you afraid of moving out on your 
own and was it an easy adjustment?

56
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,370
No,
God,

57
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,480
I wanted to move out so bad when I came 
to college.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,810
Portland,
Oregon.

59
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,480
Well,
after college I went to Portland.

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,113
Yeah.
I just didn't want to live at home 

61
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,154
anymore.
I tell that to people and my 

62
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,790
relationship with my parents has become 
exponentially better since I moved out.

63
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,190
So by the coop man,
get out.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,590
What are your tips on starting a 
vlogging channel?

No question.

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,260
He's the most powerful and you can't 
beat him.

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,880

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh,
look who it is.

72
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,293
Yeah.

73
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,560
Progressive or conservative or Democrat 
or Republican?

74
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,311
Probably.

I am A.
I'm a left of center Democrat,

76
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,350
which means I'm really close to the 
center,

77
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,800
but on the left basically exactly what 
President Obama is.

78
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,810
Do you follow any other vlogs on 
Youtube?

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,650
Of course I follow the Vlog.

the most influence on me.
I don't know him.

99
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,290
John Harrison is and he's the best 
writer of this generation.

100
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,770
If you could live in a movie and be a 
certain character in a movie for a short

101
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,604
period of time,
I still hadn't thought of who would it 

102
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:44,230
be and why?
I would be rick deckard in blade runner.

103
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,303
Why?

104
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,883
Why not?
How important was your education and 

105
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,550
your career?
Let's talk about grades.

106
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,751
Well,
grades,

107
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,700
talk about grades.
Grades Don't matter.

108
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,534
I've always.
I used to go on tours of my college and 

109
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,020
tell the kids who are thinking about 
going to bu that.

110
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,140
Great,
so let's,

111
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,983
let's,
let's break it down now if you want to 

112
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,760
be a doctor.
A lawyer requires Grad School,

113
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,230
Grad School,
grades batter.

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,133
Well,
see,

115
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,130
when I discovered grades didn't matter.
I didn't really try that hard in college

116
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,550
and then once I discovered that what he 
said made sense,

117
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,060
I didn't try that hard in college and we
both have great jobs now.

118
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,980
Do you believe in true love?
Well,

119
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,830
we talk about this earlier.
I don't know if you're saying.

120
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,664
If you're asking me,
do I believe that love is true and real 

121
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,280
then yes.
If you're asking,

122
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,320
do I believe in soulmates for for all of
us?

123
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,640
No.
No.

124
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,650
I don't think there's so much.
There's not a soul mates.

125
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,660
You don't take.
Mom and dad are soulmates.

126
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,480
No.
I think this idea that there's like this

127
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,373
other puzzle piece,
soul out there for you to meet that's 

128
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,040
searching through the world is insane,
insane idea.

129
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,380
Also,
I think that how to come.

130
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,840
They also many of met each other.
There's so many people in the world.

131
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,480
They put God really put the puzzle 
pieces close together.

132
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,680
Yeah.
Advice for college,

133
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,480
freshmen and aspiring writers.
Okay.

134
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:04,010
Here's my advice for aspiring writers.
Learn how to deal with hating yourself.

135
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,770
Writing.
That's great advice.

136
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,550
Writing in the first weeks and months is
going to be a lot of hating yourself.

137
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,740
Probably six out of the seven days that 
you write.

138
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,510
If you write all week,
you'll hate yourself.

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,673
That number will slowly shrink over time
and what you can do is really look 

140
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,310
forward to the days when you think your 
writing is good,

141
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,144
but you're always going to have those 
days when you think your writing is 

142
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:29,000
terrible and a lot of what stops writers
once they start is not being able to get

143
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,980
through those periods of days when what 
you,

144
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,350
what you think you write is really shit 
because it is really shit.

145
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,120
In the beginning you should get a second
opinion.

146
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,460
What did you think?
Your writing is really good,

147
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:40,130
but it's really not that good.
I always get a second opinion.

148
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,430
Would you rather fight one horse sized 
duck or 100 duck sized horses?

149
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,780
I think the answer is obvious.
One weight,

150
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:52,781
one horse sized duck,
or 100 duck sized horses.

151
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,100
100 ducks side is.
I think there's no.

152
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,063
There's no argument about this.
It's 100 duck sized horses because you 

153
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,320
just mow them down,
right?

154
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,223
Because you say you take a,
you take a golf club and was just 

155
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,780
fucking mow them down.

156
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,903
Yeah.

157
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:09,963
Sorry.
It will be terrifying to face the duct 

158
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,230
size horse or no,
it'd be terrifying to face a horse sized

159
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,430
stuck.
Think about this.

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,390
A horse.
A horse sized.

161
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,840
Yeah.
This is,

162
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,883
that's what it's doing.
What is the bravest thing you've ever 

163
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,350
done?
The bravest thing I ever did was tell my

164
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,770
friends that I love them.
Why do you have to make everything sound

165
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,604
dramatic?
Like there was always some deeper 

166
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:37,391
meaning to it when there is.
So actually the bid,

167
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:41,520
they were staying in these me to do it.
Thanks so much for the [inaudible],

168
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,300
for joining us for this.
This was a lot of fun.

169
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,710
And what we're going to do it again in 
the future,

170
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:45,990
I promise.
Um,

171
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,570
and we will see you next time.
Next time.

172
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,900
Do you have any hidden talents?
I can unicycle.

173
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,463
That's.
I think that person just wanted to tell 

174
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,600
me that they could do the cycle.
Oh,

175
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,100
they said I can't use the cycle.
What can I know you can.
