1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
Christoph,
let me ask you,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,870
why do you think that the Truman has 
never come close to discovering the true

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:08,610
nature of his world?
Until now,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,280
we accept the reality of the world with 
which group presented.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,940
It's as simple as that.
In the beginning of the Truman show,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,640
a star falls from the sky.
Well,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,683
a light falls from the ceiling of a sky 
high set that encloses an artificial 

8
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:28,651
town built for the life of one man and 
the entertainment of the whole world.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,750
The light says serious nine Kennis 
major,

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,830
which refers to serious the brightest 
star in the night sky.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,933
This star,
which homer one's called an evil 

12
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,394
portent,
bringing heat and fevers to suffering 

13
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,064
humanity in the film.
The falling of Sirius is the first in a 

14
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:48,070
series of ruptures in Truman's fake 
reality.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,103
A series that ends here with an actual 
rupture of breaching things as they are 

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,360
like in homework,
Peter,

17
00:00:55,361 --> 00:01:00,130
we are director of the Truman show 
envisions this door into real reality in

18
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,930
darker terms than you might expect.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,913
All the symbols we usually associate 
with goodness and positivity are behind 

20
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,020
Truman.
Bright blue skies,

21
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:12,340
Sun beams breaking through the clouds 
and expansive sea of possibility,

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,730
reality,
truth and authenticity on the other hand

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,380
are relegated to a small single 
rectangle of shadow,

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,693
hardly the light at the end of the 
tunnel that we normally associate with 

25
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,620
liberation.
All throughout the film.

26
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:29,920
Freedom for Truman is linked tightly 
with trauma.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,970
Every peak behind the curtain is 
accompanied by some form of pain,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,270
whether it's the pain of seeing the 
image of a deceased loved one,

29
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,910
the pain of a true connection abruptly 
cut short,

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,780
the pain of memory,
or simply the pain of uncertainty of not

31
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:47,650
knowing what it is you're seeing.
That's of course the pain that we're all

32
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,900
familiar with.
It's why for the most part,

33
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,730
we see only what we want to see.
Truman has been privy to a lifetime full

34
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:55,564
of hints,
clues to the fact that his world is not 

35
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:58,774
as it seems.

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,610
Yes,
which we incorporate those clues

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,783
to reconfigure the entire narrative of 
his existence and rewrites like that 

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,510
just aren't free.
They cost,

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,460
they cost suffering.
Peter,

40
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:16,580
we're in writer Andrew.
Nicole were prophetic about so much from

41
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:20,150
the vantage of 1998,
the ubiquity of reality television,

42
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:20,984
the rise of mass surveillance.
They keyed in perfectly to my parents' 

43
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:24,974
generation of cold war,
paranoia of being watched or bugged and 

44
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,320
my own generation of narcissism where it
bugs us not to be watched,

45
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,180
and that's a great joy of the Truman 
show,

46
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,043
the allegories and layered readings.
The headiness of it all stands out 

47
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,440
vividly even for a kid like I was when I
saw it at age 10.

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,393
It's not pedantic or preachy.
It just asked so many damn questions 

49
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:46,754
that they're impossible to ignore the 
hell you talking about who you talking 

50
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:52,634
to and actually I was watching it again 
recently and I was really struck by how 

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,620
easily the Truman show can be read as an
allegory for the present.

52
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,080
Like Truman's town of sea haven.
Our own world seems to be experiencing a

53
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,914
similar series of ruptures.
Rupture is like the great recession in 

54
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,200
2008,
the Arab spring,

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,333
like the killings of young black men by 
police or are increasing awareness of 

56
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:16,714
them like Brexit,
the splitting of the UK from Europe and 

57
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,404
most recently like the rise of the 
political outsider movements of Bernie 

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,753
Sanders and Donald Trump.
I think American society at large is a 

59
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,354
lot like truman,
burbank laboring like him for 30 plus 

60
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,590
years under a system that is finally 
showing itself to be ridiculous.

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,720
Society like Truman is trying to wake 
itself up while stumbling under the pain

62
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,643
that surfaces from doing so.
The Truman show is a massive operation 

63
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,994
with a crew and cast of thousands,
but for all the power that Christophe 

64
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,954
commands,
the show's success always hinges on 

65
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:57,100
Truman himself and can only work if 
truman believes in it.

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,233
He couldn't leave at anytime.
If you are absolutely determined to 

67
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,794
discover the truth,
there's no way we could prevent the 

68
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,234
powerful in our world.
Hold things in place like Christophe 

69
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:13,780
holds true,
but we hold ourselves in place to,

70
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,943
if nothing else,
it's clear that in 2016 we are slowly 

71
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,690
waking up into a new political reality 
like in Truman's world,

72
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:23,524
the power relationships of our own have 
gained in consolidated strength by 

73
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,460
convincing us that they're normal like 
laws of nature,

74
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,880
by taking any breach and folding it back
into the narrative.

75
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,170
They've kept all those like Truman who 
are perennial losers at bay,

76
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,643
but ideologies don't last forever.
Eventually they crumble under their own 

77
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,960
weight and the increasing refusal of 
people to believe in.

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,030
Thank you for your help.
You're welcome chairman.

79
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,180
The Truman show shows us what waking up 
looks like.

80
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,660
It stages in a really valuable way.
The struggles that come with it.

81
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:03,100
It shows how the messaging of the 
dominant ideology is absorbed into media

82
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,010
and into education.
It shows us how individual people,

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,873
even people we trust,
good people can become the mouthpieces 

84
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,370
of a rotten system.
Everybody is in on it.

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,120
I'd have to be in a two and most 
importantly evolve.

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,690
The Truman show imagines liberation not 
as utopia,

87
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,943
but as a world flawed,
like our own full of multiplicity and 

88
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:29,890
contradiction and people obsessed with 
TV.

89
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,830
It's a world gained only by struggle and
paint,

90
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,500
one that often looks like an evil 
portend in the moment.

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,830
It's not a sunburst and the clouds or an
endless seat,

92
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,263
but a small shadowy door that leads off 
to a territory unmapped but invested 

93
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,700
hopefully with a greater authenticity in
case I don't say.

94
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,510
Yeah,
good afternoon.

95
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,344
Good evening.
There is a new nerve writer video every 

96
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,773
Wednesday,
so if you go right there and click on 

97
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,690
that,
you'll subscribe to this channel,

98
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,480
get all the videos.
And that's what helps me out the most.

99
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,000
The Truman show blows my mind every time
I watch it.

100
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,210
I saw it in the theaters when I was 10 
in 1998 with my mom,

101
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,700
and it was one of the best movie 
experiences,

102
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,770
the formative movie experiences of my 
life.

103
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,690
Um,
so this was a blast to make.

104
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,740
Thanks so much for watching.
Again.

105
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,240
I'll see you guys next Wednesday.
