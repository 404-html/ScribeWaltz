1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
Well,
it's good to be back on schedule coffee 

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:05,580
on of Tuesday and Vlog 47.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:16,890
Okay,

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,890
so I'm tired of people trying to cash in
on my childhood hogs,

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,380
crazy bones,
yoyos pokemon cards.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,243
The TV shows that B,
which just the commercials we sat 

7
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,920
through,
the movies that changed our lives.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,963
These things are strong into my heart 
with a special tautness sensitive so 

9
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:37,080
that every cheap tug can make me feel 
something like,

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,273
but not quite genuine emotion.
Maybe you've seen the recently released 

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,040
ad for Internet explorer called child of
the nineties.

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:44,874
I can't show it for copyright reasons,
but I've put a link in the description 

13
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,844
if you want to watch it.
Essentially the ad is a collection of 

14
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:52,050
those fads and items from the childhood 
years of my generation,

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,913
nothing more certainly,
and I don't know if you could do 

16
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,470
anything less.
It's a terrible ad that plays cheaply on

17
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,304
a single emotion,
not unlike those hard commercials for 

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,340
Spca that show watery eye dogs to the 
music of Sarah Mclaughlin.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,910
Excuse me.
Whereas the SPCA,

20
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:15,520
commercial exploits are natural sympathy
and pity,

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,653
poorly for a good cause.
The Internet explorer add exploits our 

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,570
nostalgia for the loan cause of profit.
Now,

23
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:23,404
of course,
the exploitation of human emotion for 

24
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:25,294
profit is what makes the entire industry
of advertising despicable and 

25
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:29,014
reprehensible,
but as we are hardly any of us 

26
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:31,744
unconnected to it,
now we speak hypocritically when we 

27
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:35,134
vilify it,
though I've always contended citing my 

28
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:39,640
hypocritical vilification that it can 
never be art with a capital,

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,420
a advertising edits very best can be so 
art full,

30
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,254
so nuanced and spectacular that it 
becomes a hotbed of original creative 

31
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:48,934
ideas from which artists of every medium
can steal and use to their advantage at 

32
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:55,900
its worst.
Advertising Cherry picks easy sentiments

33
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,763
and paying them over and over again 
until we're all suffering from blunt 

34
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:03,430
force emotional trauma.
We'd been watching ads for a long time.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,353
We know these things.
The difference and nothing makes this 

36
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:08,890
more clear than the child of the 
nineties at is that now we.

37
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,070
My generation is the target.
Now we're working in TV like I do.

38
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,510
You hear that term tossed around a lot.
The demo.

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,570
How did we do in the demo?
Are we performing well in the demo?

40
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:22,450
The ratings weren't great,
but it's okay because the demo was good.

41
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:23,284
Demo is of course short for demographic,
just a particular section of the 

42
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,990
population,
but when people say the demo,

43
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,270
they're talking about a very specific 
group.

44
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:34,890
They're talking about people from the 
ages of 18 to 49.

45
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,650
These are the golden geese.
The people to whom the gross majority of

46
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:41,250
advertising and commercial entertainment
is ain't.

47
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,130
Why?
Well,

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,993
because we have the money with the 
invention of people meters in the early 

49
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,223
eighties.
Advertisers could see not only what 

50
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:53,500
people were watching but who was 
watching what in the early 19 seventies,

51
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,270
ABC,
the last place network,

52
00:02:55,271 --> 00:03:00,271
unable to pull in a wide swath and 
audience sold what had which was younger

53
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,860
viewers and the demo was born.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,890
Total viewing numbers matter less than 
performance in the demo.

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,813
A good example of this is the simpsons 
is a show that routinely ranked 

56
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,710
somewhere in the sixties of the most 
watched shows,

57
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,783
but the average viewer of the simpsons 
is 29 years old and that means that the 

58
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,940
simpsons can charge more per commercial 
than many of the highest rank show.

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,790
It's all predicated on the notion that 
young people,

60
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,550
young professionals like me,
have disposable income,

61
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,100
that we're more likely to spend than 
older people.

62
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,934
Not only that,
we're more likely to find brands now 

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,550
that will stick with for a lifetime.
We have the money.

64
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,760
Advertisers want the money and TV shows.
One,

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,713
the advertisers.
These are deeply ingrained 

66
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,880
relationships,
determining much of what you see and our

67
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,000
soul.
We've passed into the black heart of the

68
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,210
demo now and that means that everything 
is up for grabs,

69
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,044
including and especially our memory 
knickknacks from the nineties when life 

70
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:59,950
wasn't so terribly depressed by the idea
of rent forever,

71
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,813
when social media didn't exist,
when life was homework and home cooked 

72
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,140
meals and everything.
Now,

73
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:08,410
when these things in their own time 
giveaway to the new more complicated and

74
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,244
meaningless things of the future,
it will all be used and every sensitive 

75
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,150
heartstring will be pulled and the 
generous rosie,

76
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,163
Britta filter of memory will be 
exploited so that the perfect time of 

77
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,460
then will unfold before our eyes in 
glorious escape.

78
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,294
And the only way back there is to 
download the newest version of Internet 

79
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,214
explorer.

80
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,160
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching.

81
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,410
I wanted to remind you to follow me on 
Tumbler.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,031
I love tomorrow.
Now.

83
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:44,260
It was just a great place to put the 
images and things that inspire me all in

84
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,130
one place.
Also,

85
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:45,964
I am getting better at twitter,
sort of learning how to communicate 

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,290
interestingly on that site.
Um,

87
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,510
so follow me at the nerd writer.
Both those things are in the description

88
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,850
and I will see you next time.
