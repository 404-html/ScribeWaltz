00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,960
So I was reading a fascinating asked 
science on Reddit the other day.

2
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:10,850
Someone wanted to know what was 
happening in their mind when five apples

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:11,684
were dropped on the floor and they were 
asked to count them where they just 

4
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:18,350
counting quickly or did they remember 
what five things look like in response?

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,213
Reddit user surf,
Kate tindle gave a great concise 

6
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,870
explanation of the difference between 
counting and something called subitize.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,743
Coming from the Latin subcutis meaning 
sudden subitizing refers to our brain's 

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,440
ability to suddenly recognize objects up
to about four,

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,360
which means that if you see,
for example,

10
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,171
one,
two,

11
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,390
three,
or four pizza johns,

12
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:45,230
you don't have to spend any time looking
at each individual pizza.

13
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:46,064
John,
you just know how many pizza johns 

14
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:48,944
there,
but if you increase that number by even 

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,523
a little more,
your mind loses the ability to grasp 

16
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:55,670
what it's looking at right away.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,783
Indeed,
the time it takes to make a judgment on 

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,913
number's larger than four increases by 
about 250 to 350 milliseconds with each 

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,583
consecutive number.
That's because when you move out of the 

20
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:09,464
subitizing range,
you actually have to look at each 

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,460
individual item and count them up.
The way we do this is by taking the list

22
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:17,480
of numbers,
one,

23
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:17,871
two,
three,

24
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,321
four,
five,

25
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:18,771
six,
seven,

26
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:19,191
eight,
nine,

27
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,330
10,
and so on,

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,810
and assigning them to the pizza johns in
ascending order.

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,763
When we reached the end of our set,
whatever number we stopped on is the 

30
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:30,440
number of items there are digging a 
little deeper.

31
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:35,441
This process of counting as we know it 
involves five criteria that was a little

32
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,250
bit corny.
First,

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,113
the one to one principal,
meaning that each object can only have 

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,310
one tag or number name,
second or Dunalley meeting,

35
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,960
that the tags must be applied in the 
same order every time.

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,531
One,
two,

37
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:49,340
three,
four,

38
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,600
not three,
two,

39
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:51,500
one,
four,

40
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,340
five,
eight,

41
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,710
nine,
Omega Jackson pollock,

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,170
third,
the cardinal principle or cardinality,

43
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,004
which I mentioned before,
meaning that the last tag always 

44
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:05,080
represents the absolute quantity of the 
set forth the order irrelevance,

45
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,210
which means that it doesn't matter.
It's irrelevant which order,

46
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,210
the objects are counted.
The number will always be the same.

47
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,730
And finally fifth,
the abstraction principle,

48
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:17,690
or the ability to apply counting to a 
number of varied objects,

49
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:20,510
not just the same one,
used multiple times,

50
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,080
counting in this way,
extrapolated allows us to deal with very

51
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:28,160
large numbers aided by something which 
is not innate to our minds,

52
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:33,140
but is an artificial symbolic system 
which we've memorized to the point where

53
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:33,974
it feels a we know of a few cultures,
in fact like the Amazonian Indigenous 

54
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:41,120
Group Moon Rico,
who don't have words for number's larger

55
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:43,210
than five or the Brazilian peter hot.

56
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,053
People who only have names for one and 
two above that they just say many when 

57
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,364
tested both the moon to Roku and Pitta.
People were able to subitize small 

58
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,624
numbers and approximate large numbers 
with the same relative accuracy as 

59
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,094
Westerners,
but they could not gauge the exact 

60
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,230
amount of many items without the aid of 
precise number names,

61
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,250
subitizing and counting our incredible 
capabilities of the human brain,

62
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,084
which we take for granted every day to 
appreciate just how fast your brain 

63
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,670
works.
I'll leave you with this.

64
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:20,620
Get your pause buttons ready and pause 
when you know how many items there are.

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,913
So

66
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,563
the final point I'll make on this is 
that it seems after a number of studies 

67
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:36,384
that human beings are not the only ones 
able to make quantitative judgements 

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,810
about objects.
Certain species of monkey,

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,770
horse and bird can subsidize 
interestingly like us,

70
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,783
up to about four.
The best review that I found of 

71
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:50,424
numerical competence in animals,
well worth a read was done in 2011 bite 

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,980
Zana Resonant Cova and Boris Rye out.
Sorry for the name butchery,

73
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,610
which I'll leave a link for in the 
description under worksite and follow me

74
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,160
on Tumblr.
Asked me anything on Tumbler and twitter

75
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,700
for short little thoughts,
comment below and I will respond.

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,593
I will respond to everyone.
Also post this on Reddit if you like 

77
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:13,644
what I do and want me to keep doing it.
That has been a great way for people to 

78
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,980
see these and just get the word about 
the nerd writer out there.

79
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:20,814
So if you like the nerd writer,
post this on Reddit and I will see you 

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,190
next Monday.
Yeah,

81
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,024
I think so.
