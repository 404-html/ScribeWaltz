1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,893
It's amazing how much of our modern 
political morality is influenced by the 

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,860
philosopher John Stuart Mill and the 
mill wasn't the first person to champion

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,510
individual freedom of choice,
but the case he makes in on liberty,

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,570
his most famous work is like a diamond 
of thought put most succinctly.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,780
He says that over himself,
over his own body and mind.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,643
The individual is sovereign and if you 
want to understand the complex issue of 

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,800
who has the right to die,
you have to start here because it's this

8
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:42,210
principle of personal autonomy except in
cases where opposes harm to others.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,860
That forms it's moral and legal basis.
In American courts,

10
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,694
at least the possession of that autonomy
has become synonymous with the word 

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,283
dignity and words.
Terms in this debate have a lot of 

12
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,424
importance.
They framed the way we think of the 

13
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,780
question of doctor assisted suicide in 
the beginning.

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,330
It was called euthanasia.
In 1938,

15
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:07,740
Dr Charles Francis Potter,
a unitarian priest and humanists founded

16
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,574
the euthanasia society of America,
the first group to seriously proposed 

17
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:15,180
legislation that would legalize mercy 
death.

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,260
At least that's what the New York Times 
called the euthanasia society,

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,153
didn't like the terms death and killing,
and they preferred merciful release of 

20
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,704
course for much of the public,
the term euthanasia was already a bit 

21
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,094
too close to Eugenics,
something that the Nazis were going to 

22
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:32,844
make disgustingly clear in the next few 
years and the society wasn't doing much 

23
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,210
distinguishing itself and the words of 
its president,

24
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:44,211
euthanasia was for born defectives who 
were doomed to remain defective.

25
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,980
If that terrifies you,
it should.

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,263
So for those who saw a genuine moral 
imperative to help terminal sufferers 

27
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,440
and their life on their terms,
it was an uphill battle.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,180
And that battle too was waged in words.
In 1976,

29
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,014
the euthanasia society of America 
changed their name to the Society for 

30
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,390
the right to die.
In 1992,

31
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,990
they changed it again to choice in died 
in 1993,

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,480
another group form called compassion in 
dying.

33
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,343
And in 2002,
the former hemlock society changed its 

34
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:18,660
name to end of life choices.
Finally,

35
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,661
merging with compassion and dying in 
2003 to form compassion and choices.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,660
You can see during a process of decades,
a careful reframing of the debate as one

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,160
about choice and personal autonomy.

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
I cosmo Kramer having just seen the 
movie the other side of darkness and not

39
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,694
wanting to be in a coma like that lady 
in the movie hereby want Jerry Seinfeld 

40
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:45,600
to remove my life support,
feeding machine,

41
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,230
lung blower,
et Cetera,

42
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,140
et Cetera,
et cetera.

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,560
First

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,393
victories came in the form of advanced 
care directives or living wills and the 

45
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,044
court decisions were loaded with the 
language of autonomy and dignity to 

46
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,570
justify pulling the plug in the case of 
brain death.

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,060
And then when the first physician 
assisted death,

48
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,790
laws were passed,
dignity was front and center again.

49
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,970
Indeed such laws are often called death 
with dignity laws.

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,283
Today,
five states effectively allow physician 

51
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:13,924
assisted death and in each,
the medication can only be prescribed 

52
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,430
when certain requirements are met.
In Oregon,

53
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,540
for example,
you have to,

54
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,110
among other things,
be terminally ill with a fatal diagnosis

55
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,730
of less than six months.

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,250
The day that I learned that I was 
terminally ill,

57
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,590
that there was nothing that medicine 
could do to ameliorate even my symptoms.

58
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,283
Uh,
I decided that I wanted to live as long 

59
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:45,270
as I could,
as best I was able and I want her to die

60
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,280
with dignity with which I had lived.

61
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,290
It's an extraordinary issue.
Physician assisted death.

62
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,423
It's legal victories have been carved 
carefully from a complex and dangerous 

63
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,283
moral backdrop in a country where 
depression rates are as high as this 

64
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,854
one.
It's not without risk to sanction any 

65
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:05,440
form of suicide.
Death with dignity laws limit themselves

66
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,274
to terminally ill patients exclusively 
because it's the only instance in which 

67
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,030
we can recognize irrational desire to 
end one's own life and all other cases.

68
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:19,480
Suicide is a permanent solution to a 
temporary problem.

69
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,703
Of course,
opponents of physician assisted death 

70
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,000
don't see a moral right in any instance 
of suicide.

71
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,893
A lot of those opponents fall on the 
conservative or religious side of the 

72
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,240
spectrum where there's also a split 
among progressives,

73
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:34,480
particularly on the part of disability 
rights activists.

74
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,010
When those seeking aid and dying lists 
the reasons for their choice reasons,

75
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:42,850
such as the inability to live without 
help being a burden on their loved ones,

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
things often refer to as indignities 
activist.

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,393
Point out that those with disability 
live with such conditions for their 

78
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:51,994
entire life.
They say that physician assisted death 

79
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:54,964
laws can paint these kinds of lives as 
undignified and that creates a larger 

80
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,064
culture that the values the disabled.
This is what happens when an abstract 

81
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,134
concept like dignity,
a concept that has no fixed meaning in 

82
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,870
bioethics is invested with so much 
weight.

83
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,093
80 one percent of people who seek lethal
medication do so because they worry 

84
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,010
about a quote,
loss of dignity,

85
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,210
and yet whether dignity is a property 
that can be lost.

86
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,700
It's still a matter of philosophical 
debate.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,893
I should say now that physician assisted
death is something that I support but 

88
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:32,620
not without a little hesitation,
hesitation that's demanded.

89
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,460
I think by the blurred boundaries of a 
moral question like this one.

90
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,843
The objections posed by conservatives,
disability rights activists and others 

91
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,140
must be taken into account.
They don't negate.

92
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,974
It's neat,
but they do warn us that discussion 

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,050
across the table isn't for going to 
draft laws.

94
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,110
As subtle as the issue is,
mine is the morality of John Stuart Mill

95
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,643
in 2015 at only the latest moment in our
effort to understand the intricacies of 

96
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:06,371
individual liberty and at the heart of 
liberty is the right to define one's own

97
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,860
concept of existence,
of meaning,

98
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,723
of the universe,
and of the mystery of human life and 

99
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,824
death.

100
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,370
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

101
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,510
It was so enlightening researching and 
learning about this issue.

102
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,693
It was just so many sides to it that I 
wasn't aware of before before diving 

103
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:28,130
into this.
Um,

104
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,083
so thank you for watching and thank you 
to Eli Samuel for turning me onto this 

105
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,044
and inspiring me to do this.

109
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,430

but it's really,

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,090
really is true and you guys have been 
amazing and the quality of the content I
