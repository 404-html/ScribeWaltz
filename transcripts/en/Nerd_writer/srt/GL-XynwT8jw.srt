00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,280
If you go to Vimeo.com
staff picks page,

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,383
you'll find several short films that 
play in the same meticulously designed 

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,490
weird art house thriller space.
As Jonathan glazers under the skin.

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,693
You see that kind of thing on the web 
more than you do in the theater because 

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,390
supreme ambiguity as a cinematic 
category rarely attracts investment.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
The reason for this is contemptible,
but obvious,

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,020
the lack of explanation or closure is 
painful.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,750
It hurts,
as m John Harrison says,

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,700
therapists and unwillingness to serve up
that failure to film goers,

10
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,534
that pain,
that anxiety has ruled Hollywood from 

11
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,034
the start.
So ideas like these find a home on the 

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,990
web which embraces everything.
Art,

13
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:04,400
how shorts are potent because there are 
brief 20 minutes at the very longest,

14
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:08,420
happy to contain a single question to be
a single question.

15
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,523
What makes under the skin so special is 
that it maintains the same potency 

16
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,070
across 108 minutes.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,090
The movie follows scarlet Johansen as 
Laura a blank face,

18
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:20,924
but beautiful alien as she follows and 
ensnares young men who are never to be 

19
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,260
seen or heard from.
Again,

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,400
watching listlessly at the beach as a 
couple and their dog drowned in a strong

21
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,234
undertow.
It's made clear that Laura does not 

22
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,100
possess a traditional set of morals,
if any,

23
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:40,370
at all.
A few compatriot aliens with speed bikes

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,353
act as a cleanup crew for her nocturnal 
activities and make sure she keeps on 

25
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:47,080
schedule.
Plot wise,

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,073
that's pretty much it.
The interactions between Laura and her 

27
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:53,200
victims are tense and gripping in 
between.

28
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:58,201
Glazer treats us to long carefully frame
takes of pedestrians at shopping centers

29
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,030
or Johansen's face filmmakers.
Hold on images so you can examine them.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,180
If you see this film in theaters,
be sure to let your eyes wander.

31
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,600
I was struck by the depth of the 
Scottish landscapes,

32
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:16,220
the camera always sure to have elements 
in the for middle and background,

33
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:19,490
more three dimensional than anything you
need glasses for,

34
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:22,710
particularly when contrasted with the 
surreptitious camera work,

35
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,544
glazer use to capture real Scott's from 
the window of Laura's nondescript white 

36
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:32,320
van pepper throughout his imagery of a 
more surreal for variety,

37
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,523
evoking Kubrick at times mostly in its 
boldness and not as much as the trailer 

38
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:42,301
suggests strung together by the perfect 
screening score of Nica Levitt.

39
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,323
Then toward the end of the film,
Laura's inhumanity begins to peel back 

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,590
just in time for humanity to show its 
darkest side.

41
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,620
We finally glimpse what's under the 
skin,

42
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,010
but as she or it an alien,
the Michel novel on which under the skin

43
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,671
is based says so even glaser who's 
adaptation runs far afield of the source

44
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,784
material has said explicitly that 
Johansen's character is other worldly 

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,000
taking the film as it is.
However,

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,013
I'm not so sure there is no question 
that Laura is alien and all that 

47
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,350
adjective means unfamiliar,
disturbing,

48
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,213
distasteful.
It's impossible to parse or motivations 

49
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:27,460
except for in the broadest strokes here 
to the novel goes into much,

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,353
much more detail,
but I'm wary to identify anything that 

51
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:36,331
the film itself doesn't choose to.
Maybe Laura is just the demonstration of

52
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,194
a feeling,
an embodiment of all in nature that is 

53
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,374
reminisce,
but disinterested or just the idea of 

54
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:49,330
disinterest set loose in the locks and 
undertows of human yearning.

55
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,780
Even this I'm afraid is saying too much 
art.

56
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:56,710
House movies are unapologetic in their 
use of cinemas.

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,330
Unique toolbox as a medium of light and 
sound of imagery.

58
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,460
Film is an innately ambiguous language.
Filmmakers like laser,

59
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,294
no doubt express their vision in this 
form because actual language wasn't up 

60
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,544
to their task.
Why then should we try to bring movies 

61
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:17,530
like under the skin,
back to the page?

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,513
It works so hard to transcend because 
the alternative is paint that vast 

63
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:25,684
ambiguous space like a dark,
empty room where you can be ensnared by 

64
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:33,730
something evocative,
ensnared and suddenly consumed.

65
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,530
Never learning why.
