1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,690
That's John was very tenacious people.
They love molesting child's.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,000
It's crazy.
It's like their favorite thing.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,963
I mean when you can get so crazy because
when you consider the risk and being a 

4
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,664
child molester,
speaking not even the damage you're 

5
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,910
doing,
but the risk,

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,940
there is no worse life available to a 
human.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,590
That being a child molester and yet they
still do it,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,980
which from you could only really 
surmised that it must be really good,

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,930
but from their point of view,
it must be amazing for that.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,750
That joke offensive.
Some people seem to think that it is.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,630
What if victims are watching what a 
victim's parents are watching?

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,493
It's such a sickening thing that happens
to people that I know comedians try to 

13
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,990
push the limit and they sometimes take 
risks and they don't work,

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,600
but I think with something like child 
molestation,

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,733
it's just not funny and he's too clever.
Like he could come up with a thousand 

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,203
dollars.

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,093
What are we really asking?
When we asked whether a joke or a tweet 

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,013
or an image is offensive or not?
We're not asking really whether it's 

19
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,323
someone was offended or we know.
We're asking if what was said was 

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,450
morally right,
how could somebody determined that?

21
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:30,610
How do we know what a joke,
for example,

22
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:35,530
is morally and I feel there is no forum 
that is acceptable for this ever.

23
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,050
I know some

24
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,920
that was molested at three years old,
three years old,

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,540
no nightclub.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,130
Oh,
no place ever deserves to have

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,240
that person.
It

28
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
seems to think that it's the effect of 
the joke that matters because child 

29
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,164
molestation is such a sensitive subject 
because the harm caused is so gruesome 

30
00:01:56,221 --> 00:02:00,420
and lasting because any light hearted 
mention of it could in some way diminish

31
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,420
the suffering of victims or bring that 
pain back.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Child molestation as a topic should be 
wholly avoided in the realm of comedy.

33
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,910
Now,
that's certainly a persuasive argument.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,773
Comedies,
purpose can't be to cause pain to 

35
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,840
innocent victims,
but of course that wasn't the purpose of

36
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,820
Louis.
CK is joke in the first place.

37
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:24,180
It wasn't his intent.
It just comes down to one question.

38
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,860
Intent.
It's all about intent.

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
It's only about intent.
In that clip,

40
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:32,670
Ricky Gervais' argues the opposite of 
effect being the moral judge of a joke,

41
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:33,504
and instead says that it's the comedians
intention that really matters in the 

42
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,183
end,
clearly Louis Ck is intention in that 

43
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:40,674
joke is to use comedy to get us to think
about society's attitude and treatment 

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,180
of pedophilia,
perhaps see intimate,

45
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,023
that we revile this demographic to 
blindly taking solace in our normalcy 

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,693
when we know that the complexities of 
sexuality means that the urge to 

47
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,551
pedophilia is not something chosen never
does he forgive or validate the act.

48
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,963
He takes it for granted that child abuse
of any kind deserves the harshest scorn 

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,190
and retribution.
This,

50
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,700
I think is the intent and for many the 
effect of this joke,

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
a subtle indictment of our smug 
righteousness and our fear of the law 

52
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,200
lessness of sexuality in civilized 
society.

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,850
Indeed jokes are uniquely designed to 
deliver messages like this.

54
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,684
They sneak into consciousness past the 
barriers that normally defend against 

55
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,350
the ways of thinking that threaten our 
comfort.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,633
Now,
that's not to say that I totally agree 

57
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,810
with Jervis,
that intention is all that matters.

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,883
Clearly it isn't.
We have to be aware of both the 

59
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,670
intention and the unintended 
consequences of what we say.

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,713
We all know that too often those in 
privileged defined the boundaries of 

61
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,850
morality without taking into account the
decidedly different experiences of those

62
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,000
who've been subjugated or marginalized 
or worse.

63
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,863
These debates about political 
correctness and comedy had been 

64
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:05,320
happening more and more frequently as 
the Internet has given voice to more and

65
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,154
more people.
I'm always amazed at how the arguments 

66
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,650
devolved so quickly into two opposing 
camps.

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,633
One side,
we'll raise a concern about a joke and 

68
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:17,560
the other will come down hard defending 
jokes at all costs,

69
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:22,561
lamenting the never ending encroachment 
of Pc police and social justice warriors

70
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,613
on free speech.

71
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,020
Just want to use these words.
That's racist,

72
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,270
sexist.
That's prejudice.

73
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,030
What all this says to me is that 
morality is messy.

74
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,690
It shifts and changes,
and people often say that something went

75
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,050
over the line,
but there are no lines in morality.

76
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,250
There's a no mans land,
a nebulous fringe of very,

77
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,740
very tough questions.
The way I see it,

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,600
great comedians are like,
detectives will take a look at luther or

79
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,950
any other detective movie or TV show,
and it's easy to see that as a society,

80
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:57,784
we're sympathetic to the idea of letting
detectives bend the rules for the 

81
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:02,824
greater good.
This is because we understand that 

82
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,630
justice,
like morality is abstract.

83
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,523
Detectives are trained to navigate the 
swamps at the edges of justice and we 

84
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,934
give them the leeway to do so.
My opinion is that our best comedians 

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,290
should be given the same reasonable 
leeway with morality.

86
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,100
I don't know how the culture determines 
who's allowed to do this.

87
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,360
There are no easy answers for that.
I think when a comedian is inducted into

88
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,194
the professions highest ranks,
we just sort of know though I see how 

89
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,530
unsatisfying and answers that is.
Other than that,

90
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,110
all we can do is look at the jokes.
They're intense,

91
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,570
they're effect,
and whether or not we're laughing,

92
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
but if we want our collective morality 
to remain nuanced and progressive,

93
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,823
we have to let comedians near the things
we find uncomfortable or perhaps even 

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,473
wrong.

95
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,540
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

96
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,460
I wanted to let you know that I am 
producing the nerve writer full time,

97
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,443
so I'm devoting all my time and effort 
into making the best possible stuff for 

98
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,900
you.
Stuff that I think is,

99
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,734
I hope a cut above the torrent of 
content that is being pushed out on the 

100
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,574
Internet everyday.
So if you think that the nerd writer is 

101
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,170
something that you're not seeing 
anywhere else on line on Youtube,

102
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,223
um,
I want to ask you to please support the 

103
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,824
channel by clicking here,
here and pledging to my patrion page as 

104
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,120
little as a dollar.
Everything helps.

105
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,130
I should let you know that the nerd 
writer is always going to be free.

106
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,020
So if you can't afford it,
I don't want you to pledge.

107
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,570
But if you have a little bit left to 
spare,

108
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,480
it would be much appreciated.
So thank you so much.

109
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,920
And here are some more videos.
