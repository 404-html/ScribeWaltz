00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,900
Coffee on a Tuesday in block 35,

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,933
so there's a way to use hashtags to 
categorize tweets or messages so that 

3
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:23,470
they show up more easily in searches,
but I don't ever use hashtags like that.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
There are amazing political consequences
to Hashtags,

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,520
fast and easy ways to communicate to 
find information on a particular subject

6
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:34,420
or event like a riot or a revolution,
but I don't ever use hashtags like that.

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,670
The hashtag was thriving when I came to 
it.

8
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:37,504
People were already using it for all of 
those democratizing reasons I just 

9
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,250
mentioned as a way of networking or 
advocating,

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,850
but the networking function of hashtags 
never really interested me,

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,713
but I noticed that people were using 
hashtags in other ways to to express 

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,650
sarcasm or wit or inner monologue or 
self deprecation and I thought I can get

13
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:57,064
into that.
The first Hashtag I ever used was on an 

14
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:00,450
instagram photo I took in La.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,553
Have a man who was dressed up as a 
yellow transformer who is done with his 

16
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,250
day just walking home from work in his 
costume.

17
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:11,980
My caption was,
melancholy transformer.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,840
Hashtag save.
So,

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,810
so at the expense of murdering comedy,
by analyzing it,

20
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:20,860
I was making a joke here about a man 
whose jobs seemed to be to dress up in a

21
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,694
bulky transformers costume and walk 
around the streets of La and he didn't 

22
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,160
seem too happy about it.
And hashtag save yourself.

23
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,620
It's just a way of saying,
you can do better than this.

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,603
Just for a moment.
Let's disregard all the ridiculous 

25
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:32,794
assumptions I'm making about this guy's 
life who I know nothing about who very 

26
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,780
well might love it's June,
may very well just have gotten back from

27
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,190
transformers.
Cope very well,

28
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:40,024
might have a perfectly normal fetish for
dressing up as bubble who may very well 

29
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,020
be a transforming android.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,350
Now I could've just said,
save yourself no Hashtag,

31
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:48,184
and the message I was trying to convey 
about this guy's life would have gotten 

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,970
across.
What I'm interested in is whether or not

33
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:56,380
the addition of a Hashtag as any 
literary value to the sentiment,

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,420
and I think it does.
I was mocking,

35
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,254
but at the same time,
borrowing the intended function of 

36
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:02,794
hashtags as a means to connect our 
expression in order to add a layer of 

37
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:06,964
subtext to the company instead of just 
telling this guy to get a life I was 

38
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,720
making like the Hashtag save yourself.
Grouping already existed,

39
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:14,554
that it was trending.
People were adding to it as a way to 

40
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,434
infer that this ridiculous thing is only
one example of millions of similarly 

41
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,044
ridiculous things,
maybe even a ridiculous thing that you 

42
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:26,434
do with the Hashtag you invoke the 
community even when the community isn't 

43
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:30,250
there.

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,970
Of course I wasn't thinking this out as 
I did it and the only way that I learned

45
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:34,804
the literary way of using hashtags is by
seeing other people do it first and 

46
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,424
there are many other ways to use 
hashtags dramatically to express self 

47
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,860
deprecation or inner monologue for 
insecurity.

48
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,813
I find it fascinating that we can't help
but repurpose everything we see into 

49
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,750
stories,
even metadata,

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,333
metadata and your functions.
We will take your metadata and make it 

51
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:01,150
into box.
We are an race to say the least and it's

52
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:04,270
no surprise to me that twitter caught on
like it did.

53
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,104
It's no surprise the effect it's already
had on the world and it's no surprise 

54
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,664
that we figured out how to make little 
messages into big messages without ever 

55
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:18,690
changing the character counts.
Hey,

56
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,533
everyone and screen had been here.
So I wanted to let you know that we did 

57
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,124
a story last week on lean forward about 
the one year anniversary of occupy Wall 

58
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:28,234
Street,
which I've put on my facebook page and 

59
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,050
I'll put the link in the dually do.
So from now on,

60
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:37,051
that's where I'm going to put the links 
to videos or stories that I do on MSNBC.

61
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,973
Um,
besides that chagall 52 books they did 

62
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,303
two weeks.
Don't forget to follow me on tumblr 

63
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,444
there.
Um,

64
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,760
and Hashtag goodbye.
