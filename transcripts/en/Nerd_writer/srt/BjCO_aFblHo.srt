1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,743
Wager that a good number of artists and 
ambitious creative people like myself 

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:10,740
spend a dreadful amount of time 
considering their legacy.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,350
How will I be remembered what works of 
mine,

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,870
if any,
will carry on into posterity,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,080
immortality through art,
to give you a sense of time.

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,660
If Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet 
today,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,470
critics and all lovers of the written 
word would still be pouring over.

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,170
It's possible meanings in the year.
Twenty four,

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,004
31 a.
If Plato uploaded the republic onto the 

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:32,454
kindle library this afternoon,
political scholars would still be 

11
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,800
debating it's efficacy in 44,
oh,

12
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,570
eight.
Or as it's popularly known,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,583
you're 92 after the pen.
Galactic Battle of Gemini Centaury Long 

14
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,870
live.
The Republican,

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,953
the yearning for such immortality is no 
doubt a stupid enterprise born of some 

16
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:51,900
combination of narcissism,
insecurity,

17
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:52,734
and the fear of death,
and it doesn't even solve the real 

18
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,920
problem.
As Woody Allen said,

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,040
I don't want to achieve immortality 
through my work.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,490
I want to achieve immortality through 
not dying.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,353
Of course,
the appealing thing about having your 

22
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,304
work live on is that presumably it's the
best part of you and history can 

23
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,180
graciously forget the rest.
I want my ads yet unwritten,

24
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:15,180
great American novel to achieve 
posthumous a claim,

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,300
not this picture of me and the raccoon 
that was apparently living on my head.

26
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,310
Some things we want to be forgotten.
Well,

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,490
that's easier said than done in the 
Internet age.

28
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,620
In 1998,
the Spanish newspaper,

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,490
Lavonne,
Guardian,

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,380
published a local announcement about the
forced sale of a home due to outstanding

31
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,214
social security debts.
The property and the debts belong to a 

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:43,131
Spanish lawyer named Mario Gonzales in 
2009 11 years later.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,633
Gonzalez didn't appreciate that even 
then when you searched his name on 

34
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:48,684
Google,
what you saw at the top of the results 

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,510
was this small financial lapse from the 
late nineties.

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,660
Didn't he have a right for that 
information to be?

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,763
Last Gonzalez contacted Lavonne.
Guardian asked for them to take the 

38
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,570
story down.
They said no.

39
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,463
So he filed a complaint with the Spanish
data protection agency asking for the 

40
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,574
paper to remove the story and also for 
Google to do the same from its search 

41
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,630
engines.
The agency director rejected the request

42
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,420
to the newspaper,
but upheld the one to google,

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,860
telling them to remove the links and 
make access to that data impossible.

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,723
After some wrangling and appeals,
the highest court in the European Union 

45
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,383
supported the agency directors demand 
saying that Google was responsible for 

46
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:35,991
the processing of personal data and that
people had a right to erasure or a right

47
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,074
to be forgotten.
So what's your instinctive reaction to 

48
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:39,984
this?
Maybe you feel a strong sympathy for 

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,683
decent people who are just trying to get
out from under the shadow of the 

50
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,300
worldwide web who want their pasts to be
private.

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,163
On the other hand,
do we want business people handling our 

52
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,630
money,
for example,

53
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:56,631
to be able to erase a prior bankruptcy 
or a politician to delete some troubling

54
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,594
behavior from the past.
The problem with the court's ruling is 

55
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:00,964
that the boundaries for lodging a 
complaint are so incredibly vague and 

56
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,014
open to interpretation.
The court only says the information 

57
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,840
which is no longer relevant or timely 
can be erased,

58
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,040
but who gets to decide that American 
legal scholars are confident that such a

59
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:20,020
law would not be passed in the states 
where free speech protected by the First

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,370
Amendment is champion more readily than 
each individual's right to privacy,

61
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,050
though both are precious to us.
A recent pew study found that 68 percent

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,913
of American internet users believe 
current laws are not good enough in 

63
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:33,844
protecting people's privacy online,
and 86 percent have taken steps to mask 

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,640
their digital footprint.

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,940
Privacy is not a word that appears in 
the US Constitution.

66
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,043
The right to privacy is a relatively 
recent concept introduced by Louis 

67
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,780
Brandeis in an essay in the Harvard law 
review from 1890.

68
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,643
This question is really hard to work out
what effects do my demands to have this 

69
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:01,000
picture of me doing?
A keg stand taken off some random blog,

70
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,170
have on an open and free internet.
It's not readily apparent,

71
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,004
but when Google or facebook are burden 
with that choice at the peril of fines 

72
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,150
are worse than the path of least 
resistance may be to say,

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,500
just take it down and I think we can all
see the slippery slope in that.

74
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,490
In the description under worksighted.
I'll leave links to educated opinions on

75
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,000
both sides of this argument.
The US and Europe are primed.

76
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,620
It seems to go down different roads here
and I can't say which is the right one.

77
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,160
It's easy to choose between liberty and 
constraint,

78
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,593
but to make a judgment call is much 
harder when to liberties are at odds 

79
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,023
with each other.
There's so many things to read about 

80
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:43,970
this.
If nothing else,

81
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,903
checkout Louis.
Brandeis is essay on the right to 

82
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:47,654
privacy.
It is just a seminal essay in the 

83
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,044
history of law.
Comments below or ask me anything on 

84
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,970
Tumbler.
I'll put the link in the description.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,130
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next Friday.
