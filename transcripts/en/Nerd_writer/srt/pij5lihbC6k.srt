1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,240
You know,
of all the established directors working

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:04,074
today,
I think the one that would feel most at 

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,384
home in my world,
the world of the video essay is Edgar 

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,150
Wright.
See basically what I do here every week,

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:12,984
like any SAS is make an argument.
The difference between me and Say New 

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,833
York Times columnist Paul Krugman,
besides a phd in economics and like 

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,410
accolades,
is that I use video to make my arguments

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,050
where he has only language,
but even so,

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,884
our goals are the same.
To make a persuasive and engaging 

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,550
argument and just like writers pay close
attention to the flow of their words.

11
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:39,210
Carefully crafting the transitions from 
one idea to the next.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,250
I see the rhythm and momentum of my 
videos as crucial to their effectiveness

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,623
and here's where I can learn a lot from 
a garage and I get back to you on the 

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,250
right is a master of rhythm.

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,263
What you just saw as one of many 
extraordinary scene transitions from 

16
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:00,900
Scott pilgrim vs the world.
It lasts about four and a half seconds,

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,720
but it's worth taking a second slower 
look.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,140
This transition is all about movement to
the right.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,260
It kicks off with Anna Kendrick looking 
to camera,

20
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,060
right,
which is the direction of the movement,

21
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:15,060
but she's also looking at her brother 
through the splitscreen.

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,290
Her splitscreen is key framed off to the
left and so is Scott pilgrims,

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,520
but right as cleverly positioned him 
left in the frame so we can bring in the

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,383
unseen right hand part of the shot to 
extend the Dolly Wipe and the right of 

25
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,004
that frame is the arm chair which wipes 
across to reveal the next outdoor 

26
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:35,700
setting and the UNIMOG appeal.
Letters of the school bell aid.

27
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,534
This transition into a shot that 
continues the motion by actually 

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,040
dollying to the right.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,170
If you were to diagram out this 
transition,

30
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,004
it would look a little like this and it 
gives you a better sense of just how 

31
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:49,530
much care is put into a handful of 
frames.

32
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,880
The transitions are a site of 
opportunity for Edgar right there.

33
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,714
Not only an opportunity for visual jokes
as my friend Tony explored briefly in 

34
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,450
another video,
which I'll link to right here.

35
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,860
There are a chance to build important 
connective tissue that brings the viewer

36
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,420
through the story.
In fact,

37
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,940
I think a story is a lot like an 
argument.

38
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,690
It has to be persuasive to work.
Scott,

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,680
he only played one note for that entire 
song in the beginning of this movie.

40
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,514
Scott pilgrim is a drift.
The breakup that defined his life for 

41
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:24,120
the past year is no longer an excuse for
his sour attitude.

42
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:28,740
He begins a relationship with a 17 year 
old that's clearly not serious to him,

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,200
and he's kind of just floating through 
life.

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,230
It's a feeling that I'm sure a lot of 
people are familiar with.

45
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,123
I know I am.
When everything sort of melts together 

46
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,364
and you skip around in time from place 
to place to communicate this feeling 

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,290
right melts together the transitions 
between settings.

48
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,490
He utilizes a few techniques to do this 
on Scott State with knives for example,

49
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:54,750
there are a series of frame wipes that 
use diabetic moving objects.

50
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:55,584
Usually people that are so seamless,
they momentarily trick the brain into 

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,350
not registering the transition.
What's more?

52
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,490
These wipes are all accompanied by sound
effects,

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,520
which are also diabetic,
whether it's a car,

54
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,520
a skateboard,
the wrestling of clothes hangers,

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,930
or the beep of a sliding door all 
pulling deeper into the world.

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,910
You also have shots where the reverse 
shot is matched in framing,

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,910
but in a totally different location.
I mean,

58
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,980
this is really cool because right is 
using the rules of cinema against you.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,833
You're not trained to think that a scene
transition could come between a shot 

60
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,840
reverse shot,
so you're already engaging with the next

61
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,350
place before you realize that you've 
left the last one.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,733
When you think back on this sequence,
it's hard to remember all the locations 

63
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,630
as distinct,
which is exactly what Scott is feeling.

64
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,464
I told you like 50 times,
party retard all throughout Scott 

65
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,161
Pilgrim,
right?

66
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,920
Never misses a chance to use a creative 
transition,

67
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,990
whether it's from scene to scene,
Oh hey,

68
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:57,640
it's tonight at the run or within scenes
from shot to shot.

69
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,210
I think the overall effect of this is 
two fold.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,073
Not only do the wipes and whip pans and 
match cuts draw you along the story as 

71
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:06,994
it unfolds,
but they also make you into a more 

72
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,280
observant viewer.
They're transitions that disappeared the

73
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:16,120
first time you watch and stand out the 
second time or vice versa.

74
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,453
I mean,
where exactly is the scene transition 

75
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,523
here?
It's happening completely off screen or 

76
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,840
rather behind the screen.
My guess is either that the house set is

77
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
on wheels or the bathroom itself is 
being spun around to face another 

78
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,550
backdrop,
whichever it is.

79
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,384
The transition is disorienting in the 
best way and because what's happening 

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,553
isn't possible.
You're encouraged to sort of put the 

81
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:43,120
film together and interactivity that's 
appropriate in a movie about gaming.

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,073
What's important is that the film goer 
is involved and engrossed at the same 

83
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:48,784
time.
This delicate balance is achieved 

84
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,650
through transitions that are often 
lyrical,

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,160
like a kind of visual poetry in the most
unlikely place.

86
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,670
It might be worth noting too that Scott 
pilgrim is a story about a transitionary

87
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,083
period in the hero's slight for period 
between knowing who you were and 

88
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,004
deciding who you're going to be.
A life's transitions are harder to 

89
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,330
navigate than those in film or a video 
essay,

90
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,673
but all of them have to be persuasive 
and persuasion is about more than the 

91
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:27,310
words or the images or the ideas you 
use.

92
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,830
It's also about how you connect.
Now.

93
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,240
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

94
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,280
There is a new nerdwriter episode every 
Wednesday,

95
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,040
so if you click right there,
you'll subscribe to this channel and get

96
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,030
all the videos.
Guys,

97
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm in Venice.
Can you see?

98
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,270
Can you see that?
I'm in Venice,

99
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,620
Italy.
That is amazing.

100
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm here for a month and a half working,
living,

101
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,094
exploring.
It's this place is like a dream and 

102
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,114
being here as a dream for me anyway.
I have to think squarespace for 

103
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,710
sponsoring this video.
They make sleek,

104
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,544
intuitive websites.
I just made one called the nerd 

105
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,730
writer.net.
You sign up for a year,

106
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:10,790
you can get a free domain name and if 
you use the offer code nerdwriter,

107
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,400
you can get 10 percent off your first 
purchase.

108
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,770
You know it's really easy to do.
Go make one.

109
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,604
It's fun.
Thanks guys for that and I will see the 

110
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,040
rest of you.
Hopefully next Wednesday I'm in.
