1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Coffee on Tuesday and block six.
I was trying to figure out what I should

2
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:15,724
do for my next blog,
so I went upstairs and talked to my 

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,510
neighbors,
told me he's been dying to go to the big

4
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:22,360
scientology complex on sunset boulevard.
So I said,

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,403
perfect

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,950
with scientology.
Here it is.

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,100
Church of Scientology.

8
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,603
He didn't let us take the camera inside,
so I'll just tell you what happened 

9
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:50,664
next.
We were greeted by a receptionist who 

10
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,060
looked like he was 19 years old and 
looked us straight in the eye.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,100
Everybody in that building looks you 
straight in the eye.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,023
The first thing he did was pushed 
forward a piece of paper on what you 

13
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,940
were supposed to write,
our first name or last name,

14
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,110
our address,
our phone number,

15
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:01,944
and the reason why we were coming here,
we said that we were interested in the 

16
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,850
religion and that we wanted to know more
about it.

17
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,120
So he suggested that we take the self 
guided multimedia tour.

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,380
This is an invitation to freedom,
man can save his soul.

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,213
So in the back part of the lobbyists,
all these interactive tvs where you can 

20
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:24,154
watch different aspects of scientology 
and move your way around and learn all 

21
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:28,744
different types of things.
I got these two sample dvds first the 

22
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:35,920
way to happiness and seconds,
scientology and overview.

23
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,783
There was a booth on scientology ethics.
There was a booth on the evil of 

24
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:41,380
psychiatry.
I've never agreed with psychiatry

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,493
ever

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,330
before.
I was a scientologist.

27
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:47,164
I never agreed with psychiatry.
And then when I started studying the 

28
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,624
history of psychiatry,
I started realizing more and more why I 

29
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:52,740
didn't agree with psychiatry.

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,603
There was a booth that started to 
explain that the loss of p of 

31
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,974
scientology.
There was a booth all about l Ron 

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,043
Hubbard.
There was even a booth where you could 

33
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:59,574
see your own thoughts.
Is the device that you used to do that 

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,590
looks like an old toy telephone.
After the self guided multimedia tour,

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,380
we went up front and asked to take 
personality tests.

36
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,214
So I think me and Zee,
I thought that it would be like a 10 to 

37
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,970
20 question test,
200 questions.

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,983
Some of the questions.
Where do you feel ill at ease in the 

39
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,100
company of children?
Do you whistle while you work?

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,020
If a 10 year old was acting out of 
place,

41
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,303
you would approve corporal punishment.
You find yourself dwelling on past 

42
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,364
misfortunes.
You rarely think about past failure 

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,500
during the type of person who's always 
thinking about what you could've done.

44
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,470
Does it sometimes feel that all of 
reality is a dream?

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,270
Finally a question.
One hundred 92,

46
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,104
they asked the question that they had 
been asking over and over in so many 

47
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:41,640
different ways,
are you depressed?

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,990
It's very,
very,

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,580
very easy to see how if you are 
emotionally distressed state bank,

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,900
a cow capture you,
big old fucking that on you.

51
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,080
For

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,913
someone who is depressed or who just 
feels particularly empty for someone 

53
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:59,410
who's tried psychology and psychiatry 
and it hasn't for them,

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,050
why not adopt the idea that psychiatry 
is actually evil?

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,913
Sometimes it's easy for us when we're in
a vulnerable position to take the exact 

56
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,370
opposite stance of the stance that you 
had before when really the answer is not

57
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,204
to flip your ideas 180 degrees,
but only to adjust it a little bit him 

58
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,920
either way,
but anyway,

59
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,754
in five minutes the receptionist 
returned with the result of our 

60
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,000
personality tests.
Here it is.

61
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,070
You can see that it's a line graph 
showing where it is.

62
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:24,880
You are in between the spectrum of 
several different traits.

63
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,290
The young scientologist said to me,
now,

64
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,300
sir,
this is not our opinion of you.

65
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,690
This is a scientific analysis of your 
opinion of yourself.

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,553
So we went over the results and he asked
me a lot of questions which I tried to 

67
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,760
answer as honestly as I could,
and a big deal was made.

68
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:39,520
All the while about how practical 
scientology is.

69
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,383
See,
the first step that you take after you 

70
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,770
take the personality test is a series of
communication courses.

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,633
In those courses,
you're meant to unlearn the ways that 

72
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,960
we've learned to imperfectness,
communicate with each other,

73
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:50,794
and I talked to a few scientologists 
there who all said that after those 

74
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,854
courses they really learn to open up 
themselves to communication and I 

75
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,934
believe that it works for them.
Although it may be the clue to why they 

76
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,640
all seem a little bit brainwashed.

77
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,860
They're all learning communication in a 
way that makes them act the way they do.

78
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,000
You know,
I,

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,833
I,
I assume the communications courses and 

80
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,180
other courses that you have to take our 
very specific.

81
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,470
Anyway,
the next step is purification.

82
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,333
So I asked them what purification was 
thinking that it would be just a bunch 

83
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:20,970
of people sitting in a room trying to 
think away the toxins.

84
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:21,804
He said,
actually we have a few large Saunas and 

85
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:23,754
the facility and you sit in them and 
sweat out all the toxins and the next 

86
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,210
thing after that is the beginning of the
bridge to total freedom.

87
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,550
So here's where I had the question that 
I really wanted to ask,

88
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,443
and that was where does the practical 
almost utilitarian side of scientology 

89
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,600
come into contact with the religious 
side?

90
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,493
He couldn't answer that question.
So I had to be taken to a new 

91
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:45,804
scientologists.
So we walked over to another desk and I 

92
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:49,080
sat down and I asked the same question 
but a little bit,

93
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,940
frank,
or what do you worship here?

94
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,380
Because Christianity,
for example,

95
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:57,381
has got the Bible and Jesus and this is 
the infallible words of their religion.

96
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,283
Now the second scientologists took the 
tack that there is no worship going on 

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,993
in scientology.
Now I don't know if I really believe 

98
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,880
them on that,
but taking him at his word.

99
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:06,714
I said,
then why do you call yourselves a 

100
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,140
religion?
And he said,

101
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:10,501
well,
you know,

102
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,600
the word religion has been usurped over 
the years.

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,411
And I said,
yeah,

104
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:15,300
maybe that's true,
but the religious people have had it for

105
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:17,160
a good 2000 years,
so let's,

106
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,260
let's just give it to them.
I said to him,

107
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,123
I think you're alienating people by 
calling it a religion if all it really 

108
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,670
is is a self help community.
Unfortunately that's when I had to leave

109
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:28,680
because the building was closing and my 
neighbors,

110
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,970
he had had to get back to our house.

111
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,923
So what did you think was interesting?
I didn't know about their volunteer 

112
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:44,031
efforts.
She made a big push about religion.

113
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,000
You know,
they know differ that much.

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,313
They ask you to be good to other people,
but I'm sure behind closed doors swing 

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,850
basically segregate people and

116
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,930
always put up walls.
I don't know what I really believe about

117
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:03,764
scientology.
I don't know what I think goes on in 

118
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,890
there.
I don't know where the money comes from.

119
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,650
I don't know any of these things.
To us on the outside looking in.

120
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,360
Scientology is like a frog.
We don't see past the doors,

121
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,194
but I recommend anybody who's interested
to go there because they will give you 

122
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:18,734
certain answers to certain questions and
you can learn at least a little bit 

123
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,400
about the mystery that is scientology.
Make your decisions on it for yourself,

124
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,670
but just remember,
give a fake name.
