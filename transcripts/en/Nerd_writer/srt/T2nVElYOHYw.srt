1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,463
We have,

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,573
I think we can all agree that political 
corruption is a bad thing and you don't 

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,714
get more black and white in this regard.
In the case of former Virginia Governor 

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,603
Bob Mcdonnell,
former Republican governor of Virginia 

5
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:20,754
bobbing,
Donald has an Alvin sentenced to two 

6
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,410
years in prison,
24 months.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,820
That is how long Bob Mcdonald will spend
in jail for corruption charges.

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:34,821
Last year at Mcdonald was convicted of 
accepting gifts from a donor in exchange

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,940
for political favors.
This kind of personal corruption,

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,803
quid pro quo stuff is what we're used to
seeing on television and in film put 

11
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,540
simply,
we don't want those in power.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,870
Our elected leaders to take ethical 
shortcuts and we shouldn't,

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,043
but our defenses are fragile.
If personal corruption is the only kind 

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,890
we recognize and protect ourselves 
against.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,353
Unfortunately,
this is exactly the case in the United 

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,010
States.
A little over five years ago,

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,873
the Supreme Court in the landmark 
decision of citizens united versus fec 

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,333
took up the argument against structural 
corruption and what happens when the 

19
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,354
political system itself is dependent on 
money from private interests and found 

20
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,490
it.
Last week,

21
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,324
the Supreme Court reversed a century of 
law that I believe will open the 

22
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,180
floodgates for special one.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,040
The majority decided that political 
donations from how ever large and entity

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,173
or protected as a form of free speech,
but does this misunderstand the way 

25
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,004
politics actually works.
Though there is no explicit promise of 

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,833
legislative favors for campaign donors,
politicians remain indebted to their 

27
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:49,424
wealthiest benefactors and this that 
weaves its way into policy decisions 

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,550
that considered the needs of private 
interests over those of the common.

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,530
Now,
the key argument against regulating this

30
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:05,180
kind of structural corruption is that 
it's hard to determine where free speech

31
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:10,181
ends and political corruption begins and
that it may not be the court's placed to

32
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,430
draw that line.
The premise is freedom of speech,

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,703
the more speech the bed,
but my only recognizing something for 

34
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:18,644
something personal corruption.
The courts actually do draw a line and 

35
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,790
abdicate themselves from the complex 
interplay of money and politics,

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,780
and I guess most people who accused 
American politics of being corrupt,

37
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,943
do so because they see an essential 
unfairness in the system reflected in 

38
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,680
vast economic inequality.

39
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,020
That's getting worse,
not better.

40
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,063
As time goes on,
when the power of a political campaign 

41
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:42,704
comes down to the size of its coffers,
it's easy to see how moneyed interests 

42
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:51,350
retaining an improper advantage and when
that advantage serves to worsen existing

43
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:54,260
inequalities in the system,
such politics are,

44
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,610
at least in part structurally corrupt,
worst of all,

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,473
structural corruption more than personal
corruption perpetuates the idea that 

46
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,290
individual people don't have a voice in 
politics.

47
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,124
That putting the needs of the 
Commonwealth first is impossible and so 

48
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,280
it's pointless to try.
Ironically,

49
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,310
this kind of collective action 
diminished by the free speech of wealthy

50
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,214
special interests is the only way to 
protect democracy from the corrupting 

51
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:26,800
influences at it.

structural corruption,

I just find it really interesting and 

61
