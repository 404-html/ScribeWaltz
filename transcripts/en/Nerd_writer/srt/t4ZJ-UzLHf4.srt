00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,354
It's like a big one.
It's like a big Italian food mart where 

5
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:31,530
they make all this stuff fresh.
The Pasta.

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,364
The bread.
The meat.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,110
Well,
I don't make the meat fresh,

8
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:36,250
but they cut it.
You know what?

00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:18,831
Polish dollars for that.
