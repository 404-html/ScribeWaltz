00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,780
Why is David fincher?
In my head,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,140
I was thinking about this a lot while 
watching his new netflix series,

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,003
mind hunter,
I'd watch an episode or to go to the 

4
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:14,050
kitchen to get a drink and everything 
would look.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,943
Fincher,
ask like my eyes were mimicking his 

6
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,630
camera movement somehow.
First I was creeped out,

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,460
then I was impressed and then it was 
curious what about his filmmaking causes

8
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:25,294
this effect because there are plenty of 
other amazing stylistic directors whose 

9
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,930
visual styles don't hijack your census 
like venture does,

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,330
and it's the same with all his movies 
and TV shows.

11
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,164
I checked,
I went back through all of them to see 

12
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:40,960
if I could locate the source of this 
quality and I think I found it here.

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,170
Did you see that?
It's a very small thing and it's easy to

14
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,510
miss,
but the more I watched fincher's work,

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,320
the more it stands out as a key element 
of his visual language.

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,120
What is it exactly?
Well,

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,580
it's a camera move.
In this case,

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,350
the tilt,
in this case,

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,200
a pan in this case,
a tracking shot,

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,453
and in this case all three these things 
are the most common tools and the 

21
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:09,954
filmmakers toolbox.
You can find them in pretty much any 

22
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,324
film you watch,
but fincher has a very specific way of 

23
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,170
using them which falls in line with his 
reputation as a perfectionist.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,063
Essentially what he tries to do is have 
the camera exactly match the velocity 

25
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,100
and direction of the moving character in
the frame.

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,670
When the character stops,
the camera stops and starts again.

27
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,504
When the person starts to move again,
but the matching movement here isn't 

28
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:33,720
just clothes.

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,730
It's perfect,
so perfect.

30
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:36,564
In fact,
that it must involve some kind of time 

31
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,634
to rehearsal with the actors,
which I learned when I tried to do it 

32
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,024
myself earlier.
This is no doubt a part of the reason 

33
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,440
why fincher is known for doing so many 
takes.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,513
It takes patience and a good camera 
operator to get these moves exactly 

35
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:51,720
right and they're happening all the 
time,

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,540
everywhere in little shots in between 
shots,

37
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,403
shots.
You notice in shots you don't and 

38
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,774
whether they register or not,
the effect starts to accumulate in your 

39
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,344
mind.
All of a sudden fincher's reality is 

40
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:04,500
your reality.
Now,

41
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,334
I think there's a very good reason why 
this happens and it's a bit 

42
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,394
counterintuitive when you consider that 
fincher's camera work is often regarded 

43
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:15,690
as impersonal or coldly omniscient even 
by fincher himself,

44
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,683
and I think that's somewhat disingenuous
because what these shots do is 

45
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,700
effectively lock you in to the behavior 
of the characters.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,780
You really feel it when someone moves 
around the space that they're in.

47
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,830
Even small gestures like a shrug or 
deflated shoulders.

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,850
Even the slightest change in posture is 
registered by this camera.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,893
In this way.
I think pinterest cinematography is a 

50
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,710
lot more personal than even he makes 
out.

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,560
It might happen just below the level of 
consciousness,

52
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,490
but a much more in sync with this 
character than I am with,

53
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,020
for example,
this character.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,033
It's funny,
fincher's actors have to move in these 

55
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:55,980
very deliberate lines at steady speed's 
probably ironed out by rehearsal,

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
but the result,
at least for me,

57
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,410
is a greater connection to the character
than something that is more free form.

58
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,000
Less exact.
I mean,

59
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,940
it's no surprise that fincher would pay 
attention to details like this.

60
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,983
Listen to the advice he gave Robin 
Wright when she directed her first 

61
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,590
episode of House of cards.

62
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,110
Every scene you direct,
every scene you act in,

63
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,870
it's the same thing.
What's that?

64
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,870
He said,
behavior over time,

65
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,663
it's a fraction.
So behavior is the most important thing 

66
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,030
of every piece of material that you 
read,

67
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,650
that you performance and you direct.
Look at the behavior,

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,230
David.
Fincher is obsessed with behavior.

69
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,820
He knows that the way a person moves is 
a key part of who they are and what they

70
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,100
want.
He knows that if a person is running and

71
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:43,934
the camera follows that running exactly,
then it's like the audience is running 

72
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:49,910
too.
He knows that the truth of aspiration is

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
in the speed.
Someone lurches forward.

74
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,263
He knows that fear can express itself in
exactly how slow someone stands up or 

75
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,440
that when a person floats back in 
astonishment,

76
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,573
the camera should follow up with them.
It's not a coincidence that emotion has 

77
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:08,690
the word emotion.
Emotions express themselves physically.

78
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,650
What fincher does is put his camera in 
lock,

79
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,630
step with the body to capture that 
physicality,

80
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,763
and as a result,
we developed this almost unconscious 

81
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,220
connection with these characters,
but the trick works almost too well.

82
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,430
You start to notice behavior and 
movement in the real world,

83
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,210
but in the way that fincher stages then 
deliberate,

84
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,223
steady and precise for a little while.
At least David fincher hijacks your 

85
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:36,134
eyes.

86
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,613
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching my video 

87
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,110
on fincher.
If you want to learn more about him,

88
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:44,944
I definitely recommend watching my 
friend Tony's video on what he doesn't 

89
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,790
do,
his movies,

90
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,050
which is super interesting.
Also,

91
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:50,884
Captain Christian did something on the 
invisible digital effects in venture 

92
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,900
films.
I'll link both of those below.

93
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,734
Definitely watch those.
