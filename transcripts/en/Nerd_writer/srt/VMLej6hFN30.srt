1
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,330
The first thing you notice about Michael
Mann's heat is that it's all long lenses

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,673
in a widescreen 23 by nine format meant 
to allow for a broad scope so that you 

3
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:25,654
can see more man crowds,
his subjects into the frame as if you 

4
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:34,540
were always watching them on a stakeout 
from some hidden vantage on the building

5
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,860
opposite the telephoto Lens is really 
the perfect lens for this film.

6
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:43,060
It has the effect of keeping everything 
at a distance all at the same time,

7
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,923
separating people from the background 
while also at the same time turning the 

8
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:50,620
background into an almost liquid plane 
of lights.

9
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:51,454
Evoking that fantastical romance that is
always found in new war and which 

10
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:58,870
Michael Mann seeds in the sprawl of Los 
Angeles.

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,213
This is all to say that the telephoto 
Lens is both functional and stylistic 

12
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:05,104
and he two words that could be used to 
describe the driving ethos behind man's 

13
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,450
work.
Of course,

14
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:13,120
style is never something Michael Man's 
been accused of.

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,463
In fact,
it's likely accusations of empty 

16
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:20,834
stylistics from the days of Miami vice 
that made man insist that he wasn't a 

17
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:29,300
genre film at all,
but it drama drawn from the stories of a

18
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:32,630
real life detective who served as a 
consultant on the film,

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,913
and it's true,
the procedural and mundane elements of 

20
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,304
police and criminal activity are 
painstakingly rendered and heat and 

21
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:44,570
there's a pride in the fact that the 
locations are real locations in La.

22
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,930
This was an actual cardboard community 
on terminal island.

23
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,030
This train that the neuro gets out of 
his,

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,893
the Real Blue Line of the Los Angeles 
Mta and his house is a real house in 

25
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:55,694
Malibu by the sea,
but man can't hide his knack for and 

26
00:01:58,761 --> 00:01:59,594
devotion to style.
The three locations I mentioned may be 

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,553
real places,
but it's not an accident that in the 

28
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,134
first a giant mound of yellow sulfur 
gives the space a dreamlike quality or 

29
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,450
that the train platform feels both alien
and alienating.

30
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,320
And as for Deniros home,
what could call attention to itself more

31
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:22,780
than this blue suffused box of 
loneliness cribbed from Alex Coleville,

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,090
1967 painting Pacific.
In other words,

33
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:30,110
despite Michael Mann's protestations,
that this is not a genre piece,

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,340
he is clearly drawing from both crime 
and the war traditions.

35
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,470
What makes the film brilliant is that,
uh,

36
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:40,670
uses its style and realism to comment on
each other,

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,910
and in doing so,
updates the genre for a new age.

38
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,043
A lot of this is done through sound in 
the film by the great work and Chris 

39
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,780
Jenkins sound design and Elliot Golden 
Falls Score.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,170
The interplay is established right at 
the start as golden falls,

41
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,004
spacey,
highly stylized score fades into the 

42
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,244
hyper real sounds of a hospital and that
exchange is in the soundtrack for the 

43
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,924
scene where Pachino chases down to near 
on the highway man uses a joy division 

44
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,590
song called new dawn feeds that has a 
driving rhythm that gets the moment

45
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,443
perfect.

46
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,410
But what I just played,
that's actually not the song used in the

47
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,020
movie,
man commissioned a cover of new dawn,

48
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,854
fades by the electronic artists,
moby who super adds to this functional 

49
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,080
moment,
a layer of pure style.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,213
Listen to the difference.

51
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,413
Since its beginning,
there has been a tension and feel new 

52
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,293
war between realism and style.
It's origins in black and white and 

53
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:05,820
harsh chiaroscuro lighting attempted to 
communicate a gritty realism,

54
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,320
but in this lady in the implicitly 
abstract nature of black and white,

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,190
it created a style all its own.
It's values,

56
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:15,024
however,
we're always traditional from the start 

57
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:17,884
and the war has investigated the way men
construct their identities from what 

58
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:26,040
they do that reflected the broad scope 
of men in the early 20th century,

59
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:26,874
not just cops and robbers,
but the rise of postmodern consumerist 

60
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,494
culture of new ways to build identity 
that weren't from one's career or one's 

61
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:36,444
relationships made,
the crime films association with style 

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,870
more problematic,
but also more necessary.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,340
Man Confronts this head on with Deniro 
and Chinos characters,

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,940
Deniro style,
his slick suits his minimal empty house,

65
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,600
reflect his lifestyle of extreme 
professionalism,

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,463
matched in the actual culture of the 
eighties when the film was first 

67
00:04:58,891 --> 00:04:59,724
conceived,
but Geno tube is placed in the actual 

68
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,570
home of postmodern architect.

69
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,523
Thom Mayne in Santa Monica man knows 
that to communicate with contemporary 

70
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,024
audiences,
to make a crime noir that is fresh and 

71
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,084
looks forward,
these stylistic choices have to be 

72
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:15,294
present.
Modern audiences firmly entrenched in 

73
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:18,534
this culture register style.
They speak themselves through style and 

74
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,514
it's through this attention to style 
that he can finally level a critique on 

75
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:28,500
its own culture.
In the end,

76
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,363
Deniro and Pachino ultimately reject 
these new forms of identity 

77
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,254
construction.
You can lounge around here on her sofa 

78
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,733
in her ex husband's dead tech,
post modernistic bullshit house if you 

79
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:43,494
want to,
and they fall back on traditional 

80
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,624
methods,
but Chino looks to his work and Deniro 

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,870
looks to relationships.

82
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,410
There's no point in going anywhere

83
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,210
in this way.
Michael Man's to style in score,

84
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,010
in soundtrack,
in lenses,

85
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,570
in locations,
in wardrobe,

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,433
in lighting,
and his attention to realism in all 

87
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,974
those same categories.
Serve to illustrate a new social 

88
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:11,894
environment as well as its drawbacks and
that's what Phil knew aura was always 

89
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,324
meant to do at its best show the 
underside of culture and why it's 

90
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,720
unnecessary.
Extension of the reverse.

91
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,350
In fact,
it may be the case in our modern culture

92
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,810
that when the two sides are put face to 
face,

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,560
they don't look all that different.
Hey everybody,

94
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,640
thanks for watching.
He is one of the best crime thrillers of

95
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,470
all time.
No question about that.

96
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,620
I just want to say that 2015 has been 
the best year of my life.

97
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:50,454
Uh,
you guys have helped me expand this 

98
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:53,604
channel to something that I never could 
have imagined that a fact that I get to 

99
00:06:56,581 --> 00:07:00,930
do this full time is just beyond my 
wildest dreams.

100
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,823
I believe in this channel so much.
And when the work that's happening here 

101
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:08,730
and I really believe that to exist in 
2016 and beyond,

102
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:12,630
it has to innovate and experiment and do
new things.

103
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:13,464
And that is what I'm looking forward to 
doing and looking forward to giving to 

104
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:16,404
you.
There's a really special relationship 

105
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:20,160
between the people who watch this 
channel pleasure,

106
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:24,600
this channel on my patrion page and me 
because there's nothing in between us.

107
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,480
And that's a model that I talk about 
after every video.

108
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,950
But one that I really,
really,

109
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:29,784
really,
really believe in because this content 

110
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:36,831
is not diluted by any corporation or any
brand or anything like that.

111
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:37,650
And that's,
I think,

112
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,010
really special and I think a new model 
for the way that content can be.

113
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:41,950
So,
um,

114
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,670
I just want to say thank you for 2015.
You guys have been awesome.

115
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:45,504
If you do want to pledge,
you can click right there and go to my 

116
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,140
picture on page.
Um,

117
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,073
I will see you guys next Wednesday in 
2016 and hopefully an exciting year to 

118
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:54,834
come.
