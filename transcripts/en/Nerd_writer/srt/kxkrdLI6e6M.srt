00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,900
Dark patterns are features of interface 
design,

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,250
crafted to trick users into doing things
that they might not want to do,

3
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,620
but which benefit the business in 
question,

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,993
here's an example.
Have you ever tried to delete your 

5
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:24,890
Amazon account?
Here's the Amazon homepage.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,780
What's the first thing you might think 
to do?

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,050
The obvious place to look is the account
drop down here.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,850
Once you're in here,
you look around.

9
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:32,684
It's a lot of information,
but if I'm interested in deleting my 

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,384
account,
I think that your account is probably a 

11
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,620
good place to go.
Once I'm on this page,

12
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:41,750
there's a lot more information,
payment options,

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,480
logging insecurity,
and a bunch of stuff down here.

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,583
Unfortunately,
you could click every link on your 

15
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,194
account page,
but none would deliver you to a place 

16
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,220
where you could actually delete it 
because it's not here.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,350
In order to actually delete your Amazon 
account,

18
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:57,500
you have to go all the way down to the 
bottom of the page and under.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,410
Let us help you click help.
Once you're in here,

20
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:03,700
you have to navigate to need more help 
because you know,

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,870
putting it on this page would just be 
too easy.

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,973
Then click contact us.
This is where it starts to get 

23
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:10,760
ridiculous and it's still nowhere to be 
seen,

24
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,410
but of the four options on the top of 
that,

25
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:15,770
you want help with click prime or 
something else.

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,020
You want this something else in this.
Tell us more about your issue dropdown.

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,190
There's still nothing that suggests 
account deletion.

28
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,490
You just have to know to click login and
security,

29
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,960
and then in a second dropdown,
there it is the magic button.

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,570
Close my account,
except in order to actually do that,

31
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,404
you have to have a chat conversation 
with an Amazon associate who's going to 

32
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:38,390
tell you all the reasons I count.
Deletion is a bad idea.

33
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,420
See,
you can't delete the account yourself.

34
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,090
They have to do it for you.
This is a dark pattern,

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,810
a crappy user experience that 
intentionally makes it difficult,

36
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,703
almost impossible without help to do 
something that hurts Amazon ux 

37
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:54,980
specialists.
Harry brignull categorizes this specific

38
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:59,981
kind of dark pattern as a roach motel,
a design that makes it very easy for you

39
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:03,620
to get into a situation,
but very hard to get out.

40
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,640
Brignull is actually the one who coined 
the term dark pattern in 2010,

41
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,580
and he's been cataloging and lecturing 
about the issue ever since.

42
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,300
Many of these dark patterns we're all 
familiar with and only have to search my

43
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,970
email for a few seconds to find one.
For example,

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,863
here,
I'm getting spam emails from 

45
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:23,210
architectural digest.
I scroll down and look at that.

46
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,540
This is a mess,
but it's a mess on purpose.

47
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,200
The unsubscribe link is here,
but it's devilishly hard to see.

48
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,283
That's because it's the same font and 
virtually the same color as the rest of 

49
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:34,724
the fine print.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,833
Here's another dark pattern that uses 
color to misdirect over at the user 

51
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,074
testing blog.
Jennifer Jerome points out that the 

52
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,234
mobile game two dots carries you through
the experience by offering green 

53
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:47,060
buttons,
a green button to start the game,

54
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:47,894
a green button to pick a level of green 
button to start the level and three 

55
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:53,360
green buttons to continue to the next 
level and so,

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,840
but once you lose a level,
the color scheme changes.

57
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,853
The first screen button you see leads,
you right an in app purchase while the 

58
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,810
continue button is just a little x that 
blends into the larger element.

59
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,703
I wonder how many people clicked by 
moves reflexively as a Pedalo vion 

60
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,210
response.
Now,

61
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,550
to be fair,
this is a pretty benign dark pattern,

62
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,384
but it shows how companies can use 
something as simple as color to trick 

63
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,834
you into doing what they want.
On the more egregious end of the 

64
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:19,594
spectrum,
you have stuff like this banner ad for 

65
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:24,610
chat most which is made to look like it 
has a speck of dust on it,

66
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,390
causing people to brush it away and 
accidentally clicked the link.

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,553
Or you have sites like booking.com
where they do everything in their power 

68
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,694
to increase the urgency of a purchase 
going so far as to alert you in big red 

69
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:43,390
notifications of the hotel rooms that 
you just missed you better book.

70
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,610
Now you don't want to be left behind 
again,

71
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,473
do you every once in a while a company 
goes a little too far and actually 

72
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,284
breaks the law.
Remember when you used to get spammed 

73
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,860
with all those linkedin invites from 
friends?

74
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,963
Well,
that was because of a confusing dark 

75
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,810
pattern on there.
Add contacts page which allowed linkedin

76
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,644
to scoop up people's email contacts and 
send them messages repeatedly without 

77
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:06,100
their consent and a comprehensive blog 
post stand.

78
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:06,934
Schlosser showed how linkedin tried to 
trick users eat times and their sign up 

79
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,140
and onboarding procedures into 
surrendering their email contacts.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,870
Unfortunately for Linkedin,
this proved to be a step too far.

81
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,010
Users filed a legal challenge claiming 
that sending multiple unwarranted emails

82
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,844
hurt their professional reputation.
Linkedin settled the dispute for $13 

83
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:25,684
million dollars,
which came out in the end to about $10 

84
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,224
per user.
It's rare for dark patterns to face 

85
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,650
consequences like these mostly they stay
just on the right side of the law,

86
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,573
understanding that it's hard to 
legislate around the psychological 

87
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:39,844
tricks of Ux design.
Everything on the Internet is fighting 

88
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,624
for your attention,
but there's a difference between those 

89
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,294
who are taking the time to build trust 
and loyalty and the special offer you 

90
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,944
clicked which actually enrolled you in a
monthly subscription or the social 

91
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:54,604
network,
that dark pattern you until letting it 

92
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,570
cell data that you didn't even know it 
had.

93
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,613
Some of the responsibility is on us,
but some is on design too and it's not 

94
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,504
the fault of the designers.
They're just doing what they're tasked 

95
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,350
to do.
Knowing full well that if they don't,

96
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,600
others will,
as bricknell says,

97
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,463
our best defense against the dark 
patterns is to be aware of them and 

98
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:15,844
shame the companies who utilize them.
Design is what mediates our interaction 

99
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,150
with the Internet.
It's the language we read it in.

100
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,280
It's not too much to ask that that 
language be comprehensible and

101
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,980
hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

102
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,053
This episode is brought to you by Nord.
VPN now if you care like I do a lot 

103
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,603
about your privacy and security online,
you should absolutely be using a vpn or 

104
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,563
a virtual private network to keep your 
data safe by allowing you to connect to 

105
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,044

see your ip address and private 

106
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,350
information.
Personally,

107
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,333
I've had a few hacking scare,
so vpns really helped ease my mind when 

108
