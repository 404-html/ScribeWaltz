1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,320
Oh,
here we go,

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:05,070
fast.
You going to fight for in it.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,400
I'm not saying he's fat,
but when he jumps in the yard,

4
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,980
he gets stuck.
Jim,

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,543
Gary,

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,110
you know,
everybody that you know,

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,000
including yourself is a mind reader.
At least we all think we are.

8
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,030
We act that way because really there's 
no other way to act.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,103
We see someone do something like look at
a camera and attribute to that act and 

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
invisible mental state,
a desire and intention of feeling like 

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,300
disbelief.
This is called the theory of mind,

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,493
but there's a paradox at the heart of 
this ability that we all have because 

13
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,754
while we know that body language conveys
meaning and that we can interpret that 

14
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:47,880
meaning and even be roughly correct a 
good amount of the time,

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,133
we also know that it's impossible to see
the whole picture that we can 

16
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,220
misinterpret and be fooled because both 
of those things have happened to us.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,700
I was just wondering,
uh,

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,860
Niceville with Lee,
would you?

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,870
Let's come in Virginia with me.
I haven't split up with him as a friend.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,120
So I didn't mean as a friend

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,360
paradox in the theory of mind,
our attributes of thoughts to action and

22
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:15,194
our knowledge of the unreliability in 
that drives all of us to perform 

23
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,844
ourselves so that we can try to shape 
other people's theories of our mind and 

24
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:28,340
it's this performance and the reading of
this performance that the office created

25
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:31,850
by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant 
spotlights so well.

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,043
The people who work at wornum hog 
comprise a spectrum of competence on 

27
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,380
this scale.
On one side you have tim and Don who are

28
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,214
quite sensitive mind readers,
able to navigate the environment of the 

29
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:45,410
office with a strong sense of what 
others are feeling.

30
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,960
And on the other side you have David,
Brent,

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,200
and Gareth who are really,
really weak

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,133
mind readers.
If you do go the way Tim and you expect 

33
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:58,410
me to go in there afterwards,
make sure he wears a condom.

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,673
In the case of Gareth,
it may actually be that he's unable to 

35
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,600
read others.
Jervis explored this idea again,

36
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,434
years later with Derek,
a character who fall somewhere on the 

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,643
autism spectrum,
a condition that's marked by inherent 

38
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:16,140
difficulties with theory of mind,
but in David Brent,

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,170
we have a character so invested in the 
performance of himself that he's blocked

40
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,314
his own access to other's feelings and I
think Brent could become more receptive 

41
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:29,550
and there are rare but achingly poignant
flashes of that in the series.

42
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,990
Chris,
what don't you fuck off

43
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,750
to really do that would require 
compromising his self image,

44
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,150
which is clearly something that he's not
willing to do.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,493
The irony is that Brent can't see that a
weak theory of mind always makes for a 

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,050
week.
Self-Performance.

47
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,093
You can't brute force your preferred 
personality onto another's 

48
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,410
consciousness.
It takes two to build an identity.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,273
Indeed.
This is what makes tim the most 

50
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:56,900
successful performer of all on the show 
and the clearest evidence of this is the

51
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,950
cruel but hilarious way that he toys 
with Gareth,

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
could you give a man a lethal blow for?
I was forced to.

53
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,963
I could if it was absolutely necessary.
He's able to map Gareth's mental state 

54
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,064
so well and take advantage of his weak 
theory of mine that he can ridicule him 

55
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,340
without Gareth even knowing that it's 
going on.

56
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,440
This is a kind of psychic superpower and
we all use it when we tell someone,

57
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,670
for example,
a white lie,

58
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,773
we're trying to decode that person's 
mental state so that our performance of 

59
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,760
the lie will be successfully received.

60
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,983
In other words,
a believable performance is one that 

61
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,440
reflects back at your partner,
something that's in support of their own

62
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,274
performance of themselves.
What makes the show even more 

63
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,004
impressive?
I think an absolutely true to life is 

64
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,690
the way that it handles the other side 
of the paradox.

65
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,883
No matter where the characters fall on 
that spectrum of mind reading or 

66
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,100
performance,
none are spared from mistakes.

67
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,263
It's this essential defect in the theory
of mine that's a cause of deep anxiety 

68
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,464
for all of us,
and every time that unreliability is 

69
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,764
violently revealed to us,
the world for a brief moment becomes 

70
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,100
jibberish and the people around us 
opaque

71
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,270
because this is the only tool that we 
have,

72
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,393
and for the most part it's done like 
breathing is done without conscious 

73
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,640
attention,
so when it fails,

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,713
there's just no recourse.
It's the unflinching focus on these 

75
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,750
failures that made the office 
revolutionary.

76
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,810
A lot of people say that cringe humor 
like this is hard to watch,

77
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:26,644
and certainly it is,
but in the same way that under our 

78
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,990
confidence in theory of mind lies and 
anxiety,

79
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,243
I think that under our cringing,
there's actually a deep feeling of 

80
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,570
relief.
Cringe.

81
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:41,830
Humor privileges the moments when body 
language speaks in a way that is totally

82
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:43,750
transparent.
In that moment,

83
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,490
the embarrassment is not only palpable,
it's also palpably honest.

84
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,980
It can't be doubted.
It's a kind of trauma,

85
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,280
a rupture that discloses a real moment 
of

86
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,410
connection.
Look,

87
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,880
David,
I don't.

88
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,580
I've changed my mind.
I don't want redundancy.

89
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,140
I don't want not,
haven't signed anything so well,

90
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,050
unfortunately.
Not really up to you.

91
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,360
Sorry.
Alright.

92
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,450
Then when I'm asking please.
That might be redundant.

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,660
I don't think the show would be nearly 
as effective if it wasn't cast as a fake

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,553
documentary as opposed to simply 
watching the characters fail and 

95
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:31,380
embarrass themselves.
As an omniscient observer.

96
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,100
The employees of the office are aware of
being filmed,

97
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,950
which is to say that they're aware of 
you,

98
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,250
but not only performing for one another,
they're performing for us.

99
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,150
This is the phenomenon of the 
documentary and the documentary.

100
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,013
You can observe human behavior,
mind reading you and performing at you 

101
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,250
without having to reflect back your own 
performance.

102
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,563
You can be alone with someone,
Jason Merchant exploit the situation to 

103
00:05:58,551 --> 00:05:59,384
activate our empathy in a uniquely 
powerful way so that when you laugh at 

104
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:07,010
the office,
it's a laugh that rings out in the heart

105
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,940
of moment of cringeworthy truth.

106
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,340
Everybody.
Thanks for watching.

107
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,310
I really wish I could be recording this 
on a camera right now,

108
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,750
but it's a little bit too late and you 
know,

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,490
my office is so really incomplete in Los
Angeles and it's,

110
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,870
it's just,
it's just very frustrating.

111
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,843
Um,
thank you so much to squarespace for 

112
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,670

116
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:35,744
to know coding to make.
I'm just really easy to do and you can

And also,
thank you guys.

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,890
I'll see you next Wednesday.
And have you had.
