1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:01,850
This is

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,683
the motherboard for the Super Nintendo,
a 16 bit video game console that came 

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:06,884
out in 1991 in America,
and these are the sound chips that 

4
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,144
worked in tandem to create all the audio
sound effects and music that you heard 

5
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:15,770
in Super Nintendo Games.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,723
The first chip,
the SMP or the SPC 700 was a processing 

7
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:28,160
court,
were a video game.

8
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,240
Musician could essentially write the 
program that would tell the other chip,

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,980
the DSP,
what sounds to me,

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,750
whereas the original nes sound chip had 
just five channels and could really only

11
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,760
do creative variations on the same basic
sound.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:42,963
The Super Nintendo had eight dedicated 
channels and used a sampling system 

13
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:50,300
which meant that artists could load in 
noises or sound effects from instruments

14
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:55,301
of their choosing with room for eight 
simultaneous instruments and the ability

15
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,530
to sample different sounds.
The Super Nintendo was a big improvement

16
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:01,364
over its predecessor,
but there was still one huge limitation 

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,160
between the two chips.
The system could only accommodate for 64

18
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:07,994
kilobytes of audio ram.
To give you a sense of how small that 

19
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:11,444
is,
an average three minute MP3 song that 

20
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,610
you might buy on itunes is around six 
megabytes,

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,280
which is 100 times the size of the 
super.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
Nintendo is full capacity and that's 
just for one song.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,533
The 64 kilobytes had to hold all the 
music and the sound effects for an 

24
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:27,764
entire game,
which is why you often got music that 

25
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,840
sounded well,
not that great.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,300
When you think of sampling in popular 
music,

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,600
you might think of someone taking a few 
seconds of an old drum beat and using it

28
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,434
in new song.
Call it a sample that's even a few 

29
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,774
seconds long,
carries a whole lot of information in 

30
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,164
order to stay within the allotted 64 k 
super nintendo music samples had to be 

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,580
kind of walking all the way down to a 
single cycle of a wave form.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,280
In order to make good music with these 
limitations,

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,960
you had to be creative.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,100
What you're hearing now is aquatic 
ambience from 1994.

35
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,340
His Donkey Kong country,
a classic by one of video games.

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,950
Best Composers,
David wise wise,

37
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:21,784
was able to ring beautiful music from 
the limitations of the nintendo sound 

38
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,170
chips.
For example,

39
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,063
the evolving swimming background patents
that you're hearing in the song sweeps 

40
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,830
like this,
just work possible on the Super Nintendo

41
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,310
and sampling something.
This long and complex would have quickly

42
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,144
exceeded the capacity of the system.
So why has had to think outside of the 

43
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:41,944
box.
One of the most important features of 

44
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:48,820
the wave station is the ability to 
string together a number of waves.

45
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,690
Waves can be defined as single and 
motorcycle loops.

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,660
With more than 400 internal waves 
available,

47
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,700
you can select up to 255 different to 
play in any order,

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,940
including trace of pitch duration and 
cross fade time wise,

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,500
took inspiration from the cord wave 
station,

50
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,334
a synthesizer that came out in the early
nineties and use something called wave 

51
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,294
sequencing to take a number of tiny 
samples and play them in quick 

52
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,090
succession so that they made unique 
evolving sounds.

53
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,223
Of course the Super Nintendo couldn't 
arrange and rearrange samples on its 

54
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,540
own.
So in order to achieve this effect wise,

55
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,250
painstakingly recorded individual wave 
forms at different frequencies and place

56
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,190
them all in the coding program,
one by one.

57
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,720
This program,
by the way,

58
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:39,580
is called a music tracker where music is
essentially boiled down to numbers.

59
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,623
Each tiny sound is placed on a vertical 
timeline and the columns represent your 

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,053
note octave,
sample choice volume in some simple 

61
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,100
effects like panning,
feed and echo.

62
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,380
It took wise five full weeks to input 
every sample for aquatic ambience.

63
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,950
It's a tedious process,
but the results speak for themselves.

64
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,550
The Super Nintendo was restrictive 
system for composers.

65
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,384
There's no doubt,
but as with any limitation breeds 

66
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,810
creativity because the sound system 
consists of two chips,

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,733
64 kilobytes of Ram and a lot of 
hexadecimal code doesn't mean it can't 

68
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,110
make beautiful music.

69
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,560
Hey everybody,
thank you so much for watching.

70
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,870
This episode was brought to you by 
verve.

71
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,453
Verve is a service that pulls together a
lot of great content channels like 

72
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,330
rooster teeth,
Mondo,

73
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,390
crunchy roll,
and funimation all into one place so you

74
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:17,140
can watch some of the best anime there,
but they've also added new channels like

75
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:20,440
movie which hosts a rotating roster of 
30 indie movies,

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,513
which is something that I love.
Another show that I would personally 

77
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,094
like to recommend is gary and his demons
about a dude who is destined to fight 

78
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,880
demons but doesn't really want to do it.
It's.

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,190
It's a funny show.
Kind of like rick and morty.

80
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,024
I feel like that with verve premium you 
can get ad free access to Gary and his 

81
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:39,700
demons and everything else,
all the channels,

82
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,733
and for a limited time you can use the 
first link in the description to get a 

83
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,760
30 day free trial of verve.
Definitely try that out.

84
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,380
Thanks guys.
I'll see you next time.
