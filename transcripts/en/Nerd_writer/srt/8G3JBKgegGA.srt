1
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,440
As we sink deeper into the fever tree,
that is this unusually divisive and fear

2
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:19,274
filled season,
it's nice to have an anecdotal feeling 

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,603
in the form of winter holidays 
throughout which despite being co opted 

4
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,740
by,
hallmark commercialism,

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,730
a sense of family and of coming together
predominates.

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,890
My favorite ritual of this time of year 
is the annual broadcast,

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,180
a frank capra's.
It's a wonderful life.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,163
On Christmas Eve,
what was once a postwar box office flop 

9
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:46,160
has become a cultural phenomenon 
recognized as one of the great cinematic

10
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:50,000
masterpieces by one of our very best 
directors watching it.

11
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:50,834
Of course,
it's tempting to brush off this film is 

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,250
overly sentimental and nostalgic,
which it is,

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,880
but I think we judge it like this at our
own peril indeed,

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,923
with it's a wonderful life.
Capra interrogate some of the key 

15
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:02,744
contradictions at the heart of American 
life to see whether or not they can be 

16
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:09,590
reconciled or if in fact they don't 
exist at all.

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,200
Contradictions between the individual 
and the community,

18
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:17,201
between adventure and domesticity and 
between success and an ordinary life.

19
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,470
He stages these contradictions in the 
figure of George Bailey,

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,333
the citizen of the small town of Bedford
falls and the president of the local 

21
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,264
building and loan is the film begins.
We don't know exactly what has happened 

22
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:30,614
to George,
only that he's in serious trouble and 

23
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,134
has reached the end of his rope and that
he's about to be $80 by divine 

24
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:39,820
intervention in the form of a guardian 
angel seeking to earn his wings.

25
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,380
We learned about George's life as his 
angel does in a series of flashbacks.

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,810
Man wants to know something about him,
though

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,310
George we learn has big dreams of 
leaving Bedford falls,

28
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,460
traveling the world and becoming a 
metropolitan archetypes,

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,313
shaking the dust of this crummy little 
town off my feet and I'm going to see 

30
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,770
the oral,
but his selflessness,

31
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:00,604
his drive to do the right thing 
repeatedly comes in the way of these 

32
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,370
streams and you also learn about Bedford
falls,

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,060
a close knit community of mostly good 
people leading simple lives,

34
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,923
which is under the constant threat of 
being taken over by a ruthless 

35
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:17,800
businessman called Mr Potter.
The only thing standing in potters way,

36
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,780
his George Bailey,
his father,

37
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:22,150
and they're empathetic building and loan
operation,

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,673
the foil to potter,
the clear representation of corruption 

39
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,390
and evil,
and the film is not George himself,

40
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,300
but Mary Hatch,
George's eventual wife,

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,410
a compassionate young woman who is quite
happy to stay and live in Bedford falls.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,633
It's important to note that both Potter 
and Mary show up in every flashback 

43
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:40,654
representing George's desires for fame 
and fortune on the one hand and his 

44
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,700
drive to do the right thing for his 
community.

45
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,110
On the other,
of course,

46
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,120
it's Mary's side that eventually wins 
out,

47
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,283
but for the large majority of the film,
George is not rewarded for doing the 

48
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:54,964
right thing.
He's punished when young George rescues 

49
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:58,474
his brother from a freezing lake.
He loses the hearing in his left ear 

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,270
when you weren't his boss about a 
potentially disastrous accident.

51
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,253
He gets beaten when his father dies and 
he takes on his responsibilities at the 

52
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:08,944
building and loan.
He loses his chance for travel and 

53
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,840
college when there's a run on the bank,
he misses his own honeymoon.

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,123
Every noble sacrifice for Bedford falls 
makes Bedford falls feel more like a 

55
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,794
trap,
and instead of bringing him closer to 

56
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,640
the community,
he's helping capra shows him,

57
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,653
isolated from it in this shot,
after realizing that his dreams of 

58
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,984
travel are finally squashed for good,
George stands isolated against a train 

59
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:36,820
that he'll never get on before he walked
slowly back into the crowd,

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,520
putting a smile on again like he always 
does.

61
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,743
Despite this parade of personal wounds,
George's able to remain resilient until 

62
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,700
the very end when his scatterbrained 
uncle misplaces $8,000

63
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,700
and puts them in danger of going to jail
for fraud,

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,893
things get worse and worse,
and George believing himself worth more 

65
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,970
dead than alive.
Contemplate suicide.

66
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,343
It's at this point that his guardian 
Angel Clarence intervenes clearance odd 

67
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,704
body angel,
second class shows George what Bedford 

68
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,420
falls would have been like had he never 
existed.

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,673
What George sees is a nightmare.
Bedford falls is now Pottersville and 

70
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,474
all the dreams he had have an exciting 
life of adventure and exoticism have 

71
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,184
returned as perverted versions of 
themselves on the main drag of his 

72
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,900
former home.
The moon,

73
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,734
that George Promise to Lasso for Mary 
that she had made into a lovely 

74
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:34,690
needlepoint picture is made ugly and 
sleazy in the form of the blue moon cafe

75
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,613
Martinis Bar,
a place where any break from decent 

76
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,224
behavior was not tolerated.
As become a garish speakeasy where 

77
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:44,830
anything goes,
everything is turned into an opportunity

78
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:45,664
for crass commercialism,
even Georgia's home has become a 

79
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,444
boarding house.
When George finally gets his old life 

80
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,044
back,
he's rewarded with generosity from the 

81
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,954
community who bail him out in an 
unbelievably touching finale that ends 

82
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:00,784
with everyone,
including the cops who came to arrest 

83
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,390
him singing all plant science.

84
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,770
It's easy to get carried away in this 
wave of feeling,

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,640
but it's important to remember what 
hasn't changed,

86
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,474
and that's basically everything.
George Bailey still has to live in his 

87
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,214
drafty,
old house scraping by to support his 

88
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:29,830
family.
His business,

89
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,664
despite being bailed out by the town,
remains at the brink of being swallowed 

90
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,534
by potters,
relentless expansion and the pot our 

91
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,220
faces.
No consequences at all despite being the

92
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,054
main protagonist.
Despite stealing money from George 

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,570
Bailey,
he's not vanquished.

94
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,080
He's up $8,000
in some sense.

95
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,200
CAPRA reconciles the contradictions I 
mentioned before,

96
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,063
success is not mutually exclusive to an 
ordinary life adventure can be found in 

97
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:56,344
a domestic setting and yet the most 
basic contradiction that between the 

98
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,090
individual and the community is left 
open ended.

99
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,370
America has struggled with this 
contradiction since before its founding.

100
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,490
How does a culture predicated on 
individualism maintain public virtue?

101
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,323
How does an economic system that 
incentivizes individual success keep 

102
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,830
from exploiting communities?

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,353
If you have the answer,
tell us because we're still at the eve 

104
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:27,761
of 2016 struggling to figure it out.
I feel George's dilemma,

105
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,753
as I'm sure many of you do,
the world shines with the promise of 

106
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,340
adventure and possibility.
All that could be gained.

107
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:37,820
Experience learned.
If only you were to commit yourself to a

108
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,654
radical individualism and yet the 
responsibilities of family and of the 

109
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,270
Community Nag.
They call us back.

110
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,020
They ask us to sacrifice and solution to
this.

111
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:48,854
Everyone finds their own balance,
but you should keep in mind that it's 

112
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:52,484
these personal dilemmas played out in 
society at large that ultimately draw 

113
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:57,404
the fault lines in our politics and 
frank capra and George Bailey's time 

114
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,234
following World War II,
the idea of an American destiny of the 

115
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,570
American way still had weight and 
consensus.

116
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,003
A string of disasters have weakened.
Our resolve in such a thing have 

117
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,484
fractured our ability to imagine a 
consensus and into the void rushes the 

118
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,820
heirs to Henry Potter.

119
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,340
This is why the message of it's a 
wonderful life.

120
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,370
A message of hope and perspective is not
so shallow as it seems.

121
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,130
The contradictions in the film are never
quite resolved.

122
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:35,300
Something beautifully dramatized by the 
finial on Georgia stairs.

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,320
There will always be an incompleteness 
to life,

124
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,873
but hope is not naive.
It's hardiness and resolve against a 

125
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:48,680
situation that cannot give us assurances
or guarantees.

126
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,143
The film shows us that a change of heart
and perspective far from being 

127
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,803
powerless,
nostalgia and the face of an unusually 

128
00:07:56,151 --> 00:08:01,151
divisive and fear filled season can be a
genuinely revolutionary.

129
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,410
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching and happy holidays.

130
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,283
Whatever you celebrate out there,
if you want to help me make more of 

131
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:14,984
these nerdwriter videos,
if you like what I'm doing here and you 

132
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,174
want to see more,
I'd ask you to pledge a little bit of 

133
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,810
money to my patrion page.
Everything helps.

134
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,170
You guys have been so generous so far 
and you know,

135
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,310
all the money that you pledge goes 
directly into improving this channel.

136
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,050
Um,
you know,

137
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,280
these take a lot of time and essentially
money to make.

138
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:33,050
So everything you do is much,
much,

139
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:33,531
much,
much,

140
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,840
much appreciated.
This is one of my favorite movies of all

141
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,674
time.
Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor of 

142
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:41,380
all time.
Someone once said that George Bailey was

143
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,350
like a vessel that Jimmy Stewart poured 
every nuance of as being into an.

144
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,750
I totally agree with that.
I love this movie.

145
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,700
I'll never get tired of it.
I watch it every year.

146
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,180
Thank you again for watching and I will 
see you guys next Wednesday.
