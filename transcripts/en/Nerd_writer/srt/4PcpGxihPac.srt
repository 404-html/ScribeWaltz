1
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,863
One of the interesting byproducts of the
digitization of everything is the steep 

2
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,784
rise in nostalgia for physicality.
This is a great lecture from the writer 

3
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,004
and publisher James Bridle,
where he laughs about the fact that 

4
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,723
nobody ever really talked about the 
smell of books until ebooks started to 

5
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:36,914
threaten their existence.
All of a sudden we became nostalgic for 

6
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,914
a quality that he never really noticed 
before or take the resurgence in vinyl 

7
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,310
record sales.
Well,

8
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:49,700
it's definitely true that the sound 
quality of vinyl is amazing.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,593
I'd be willing to bet that our 
attraction to it also has something to 

10
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:53,894
do with the object itself are a real 
thing that takes up space in your home 

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
as symbol of the analog world.
As more and more of our lives get 

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,820
vacuumed into the digital realm,
we're increasingly likely,

13
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:05,654
I think,
to look for these symbols and be 

14
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:07,814
attracted to them,
and the crazy thing is that these 

15
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,710
reminders don't even have to be physical
objects.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,663
All they have to do to tap into that 
nostalgia is resemble the traits of 

17
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,474
those objects.
Think about instagram filters designed 

18
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,860
to look like old cameras and film 
stocks.

19
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:26,861
These filters mimic objects that most 
instagram users won't ever touch.

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,243
As bridle says,
putting a filter on your digital photo 

21
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,644
is an attempt to codify that image as 
memory to wrap it up in something solid 

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,220
historical that calls back to a time 
before everything was fluid and changing

23
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,800
and impossible to hold onto.
In this way,

24
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:46,130
our nostalgia becomes an aesthetic and 
in film,

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,400
one of the features of that aesthetic is
green film.

26
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,234
Grain is a texture in process film that 
has the appearance of tiny particles 

27
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:54,254
moving around randomly in the image.
The amount of grain has to do with the 

28
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:58,154
speed and size of the film stock and the
amount of light being used during the 

29
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,560
era when film was the only choice.

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,393
Many photographers and filmmakers tried 
hard to eliminate this aspect of film 

31
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,010
processing,
but it was always a part of cinema,

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,410
especially in low budget independent 
movies.

33
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,244
Using smaller film stocks like 16 
millimeter and without access to big 

34
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,354
professional studio lighting these days,
it's easy to tap into that India 

35
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,370
aesthetic.
By using grain.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,353
The grain itself is loaded with all 
these associations that reached back 

37
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,400
into the history of film.
The question is,

38
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,590
now that grain has its own aesthetic,
can that aesthetic be pushed further?

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,993
And that brings me to Mandy.
The second feature film from pandas 

40
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,310
cause mottos.
If you haven't seen it,

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,203
do that right now.
It might still be playing at a local 

42
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:47,150
theater near you.
Mandy is a revenge horror movie starring

43
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:47,984
Nicolas Cage,
reminiscent of the grindhouse films of 

44
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,700
the seventies and eighties when the 
movie is set.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,730
It's a simple story as most revenge 
movies are,

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,960
but what sets it apart is the 
psychoactive vision and focus of cars.

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,010
Matos who clearly has something very 
specific in mind.

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,590
Visually movie is dark,
grimy,

49
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:10,240
often saturated with primary colors and 
completely awash in grain.

50
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,070
In this way,
it's not unlike cars.

51
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,770
Motto says first feature beyond the 
Black Rainbow,

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,633
which is much more ambiguous plot wise,
but interested in exploring the same 

53
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,670
visual fetishes for cars.
Mottos,

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,560
it's not just about paying homage to old
films.

55
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,603
It's about learning the expressive 
potential of existing aesthetics and 

56
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,934
stretching their qualities to see what 
kinds of feelings and tones they can 

57
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,624
evoke.
The way I look at it now though is I 

58
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:37,321
feel like in the present time has no 
meaning anymore and so it's.

59
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,243
I feel like now choosing an era fear 
film is almost like choosing a color 

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,053
beyond the black rainbow and Mandy 
invite us to consider film grain as a 

61
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,744
visual tool like lighting or color,
not just a byproduct of chemical 

62
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:50,674
processing.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,873
So what is green feel like and maybe the
most prominent quality of film grain is 

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,150
movement.
The grain is always moving.

65
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,750
It's swimming,
which means that even in a still life of

66
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,660
let's say a flower on a table that 
flowers alive,

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,494
even though it's not moving,
grain gets inside whatever's in the 

68
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,570
frame and imbues it with motion.
In fact,

69
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,404
this kind of swimming,
breathing movement from within mimics 

70
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:18,190
the visual effects of hallucinogenic 
drugs which play a major part in mandate

71
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,413
film.
Grain is hypnotic and that adds to the 

72
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:21,814
sense of the film existing in a 
dreamlike universe or as one horribly 

73
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,230
bad acid trip.
At times the grain almost has a paranoid

74
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:32,380
feeling like there's something squirming
under the image.

75
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,620
Another quality of grain is that it 
blends grain,

76
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,454
gives an underlying texture to the frame
so that there is a continuity between 

77
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,110
one object and another.

78
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,153
It gives the impression that the image 
is atomized into tiny particles that 

79
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,144
could disperse and overlap because most 
often mixes heavy grain with smoke to 

80
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,840
heighten this effect for the characters 
and the viewers.

81
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,770
Nothing is solid or what it seems things
can shift at a moment's notice.

82
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,010
In a world that looks like this,
you're always vulnerable,

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,903
always at risk of coming apart.
The most striking example of this is a 

84
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:09,400
scene in the first half of Mandy.
Mandy herself is kidnapped by a cult and

85
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,234
force fed hallucinogenic drugs cause 
mottos turns the dial way up on the 

86
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:14,914
scene by drenching the image in purple 
and pink hues and adding a trailing 

87
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,530
effect to movement so that when the cult
leader,

88
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:21,364
Jeremiah sands just stimulates,
you actually have this steam of grain 

89
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,940
that falls away from Christ life.
Then when he kneels down to speak to her

90
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:35,924
up close,
because mottos actually feeds Mandy's 

91
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,924
face into sands,
it's hardly noticeable at first and 

92
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:42,494
that's purposeful.
The texture of the image helps this be 

93
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:48,200
so subtle that you're not quite sure if 
your mind is playing tricks on you.

94
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,903
It's important to know that even though 
this is cool as hell and something that 

95
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,624
film geeks like myself drool over,
this effect is not just visual 

96
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,280
decoration.
It adds to the story.

97
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,340
Sands is trying to assimilate mandy into
his coat.

98
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,350
As you see her face feed into his,
he's using the qualities of psychoactive

99
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,184
drugs to loosen Mandy's grip on her own 
identity so that he can substitute his 

100
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,360
own stuff like this is what gives mandy 
it's power.

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,300
It's the aesthetic is not added onto the
film after the fact.

102
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,403
It's a film that literally wouldn't 
function if you took those aesthetic 

103
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,544
features away.
That's true for its use of film grain 

104
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,950
and for all the other visual fireworks 
of the movie.

105
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,383
You know,
his history becomes nostalgia and 

106
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
nostalgia becomes aesthetic.
A great opportunity is being presented 

107
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,410
to new filmmakers.
I agree with cars,

108
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,430
mottos,
time has no meaning anymore.

109
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,940
Every aesthetic of the past is a Palette
for the future.

110
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,133
You can copy and paste those old 
aesthetics onto your work or you can 

111
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,874
take up the colors with a spirit of 
experimentation and have some fucking 

112
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,464
fun.

113
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,860
How you doing?
Everybody?

114
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:15,694
Thank you so much for watching.
This episode was brought to you by

classes and everything from graphic 
design and film editing to finance and 

117
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,770
it security.
You know what?

118
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:30,604
I learned photoshop.
I learned it through a mishmash of 

119
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:33,484
disconnected youtube videos and I can't 
help but feel that the process would 

120
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:37,384
have gone a lot faster if there was a 
class dedicated to teaching me 

121
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,090
everything about that program in a 
systematic way.

122
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,193
Learning new skills is super valuable to
me because whenever I learned a new 

123
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:48,364
skill,
it's like a bunch of new ideas are 

124
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:55,150
suddenly unlocked in my head.
I think what can I do with this?

125
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,420
And that always,
always helps me with writer's block.

126
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,553
