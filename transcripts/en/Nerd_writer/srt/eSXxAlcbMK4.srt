1
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,440
The year was 1997.
Bill Clinton was sworn in for the second

2
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,274
time as US president,
the United Kingdom transferred the 

3
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:38,970
sovereignty of Hong Kong to China,
effectively ending the British empire.

4
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,170
Scientists cloned a sheep at the Roslyn 
institute in Scotland,

5
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,440
and Catherine Hettinger,
an inventor from Tulsa,

6
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:50,010
Oklahoma,
filed a patent in Washington dc for what

7
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,050
was then called the spinning toy,

8
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,323
what the world knows now as the fidget 
spinner was an invention born out of 

9
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,540
paint in the early nineties,
living in Florida,

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,670
passenger was suffering from my 
Asthenia,

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,290
gravis and neuromuscular disease that 
causes weakness in the skeletal muscles.

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,320
I couldn't pick up her toys or play with
them at all.

13
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,510
Hettinger says of her then young 
daughter,

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,733
so I started throwing things together 
with newspaper and tape than other 

15
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,500
stuff.
It wasn't really even prototyping.

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,663
It was some semblance of something.
It wasn't long until that semblance 

17
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,853
began to take shape.
Pittenger flew with her daughter to our 

18
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:34,764
nation's capital to patent her new 
invention with the anticipation perhaps 

19
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,500
of a gold rush

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,753
shopping for the next furby.
That was the goal at the sixth annual 

21
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:51,300
toy and decoration affair.
At the Metro Toronto Convention Center,

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,690
our own young at heart reporter Brian 
Hatchell stuff by

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,753
say hello to crazy bones.
These small plastic figurines come and 

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,540
dozens of shapes and sizes and cost 
about a buck each.

25
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,260
The 19 nineties were of course no 
stranger to toy crisis,

26
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,150
whether it was crazy bones or pugs,
furbies or Tamagotchi.

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,710
Every year the world was once again 
possessed with a new favorite toy.

28
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,780
No one could guess what was going to be 
next.

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,420
Toy makers would have paid handsomely to
anybody who could,

30
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,583
but each time the new craze seemed to 
sink pointedly with the national 

31
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,200
character.

32
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,830
What is Jack?

33
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,850
I think there's anything tremendously 
philosophic about it.

34
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,650
I don't think it's any metaphysical.
I just think it's

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,713
which one to watch.
Suck it up and scrub it up with a guy 

36
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,410
back.
Pop it up and pull it up later.

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,910
If Catherine hettinger returned from 
Washington DC with magnificent images of

38
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,803
GAC swirling around in her head,
who could blame her and for awhile it 

39
00:02:58,771 --> 00:02:59,604
looked,
those gaps soak dreams would become a 

40
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,280
reality.
The mammoth toy company,

41
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,370
Hasbro agreed to test headend jurors 
finger spinners.

42
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,983
Unfortunately,
in the end they decided not to move 

43
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,554
forward with the production and some 
things that should not have been 

44
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:21,130
forgotten or lost.
History became legend.

45
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,623
Legend became myth,
and for two decades the spinning toy 

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,390
passed out of all knowledge until when 
chance came,

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,180
it ensnared a new generation.

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,373
They are popping up more and more in 
schools and stores are really having a 

49
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,694
hard time keeping them on the shelves.
I'm talking about fidget spinners or 

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,670
fidget spinners.
We'll call them fidget spinners,

51
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:50,560
fidget widgets or whatever you'd like.

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,730
Fidget,
spinner,

53
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,240
fidget spinners is caught a fidget 
spinner.

54
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:55,074
My daughter has one.
You just kind of put on your finger and 

55
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:56,844
spin it around like this though.
No one can say when exactly the fidget 

56
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:05,010
spinner came to America.
In late 2016 reality TV star,

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,670
Donald trump had been elected.
The 45th president of the United States.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All cell phones had lost physical 
buttons in favor of touchscreens and two

59
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,084
brothers,
mark and Matthew Mclaughlin had just 

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,360
unexpectedly raised $6,000,000
for a trinket called the fidget cube,

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,420
which a great story.
It's a human story.

62
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,130
It's a story of those who went first.
They were first.

63
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,020
They led the way they opened the trail.
It's obvious to everyone that the fidget

64
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,990
cube is fun.
I mean just look at it,

65
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,003
but it was much more than that.
Citing a study from the Australian 

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,993
Journal of learning difficulties.
A claim was made that these game 

67
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:51,951
changing toys could actually help those 
afflicted with Adhd to focus better,

68
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,213
engaging in fine motor activity.
The study said may assist students with 

69
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,773
Adhd in resisting the pool of 
distraction and then two days before 

70
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:05,730
Christmas fidget spinners dormant for 
almost two decades,

71
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:06,564
except in certain underground fidget 
circles exploded like lightening onto 

72
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:11,664
the scene.

73
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,680
It's more exciting than than this makes 
it seem these days

74
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,543
fidget spinners are everywhere.
They're in office cubicles and 

75
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,070
playgrounds in hospitals and locker 
rooms.

76
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,293
Even in the White House,
everything must be perfectly done and 

77
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,314
they weren't working in a production 
line and you have to get so many pieces 

78
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:42,464
done per hour,
but it all had to be perfectly done and 

79
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:50,321
it does extend to you as you look at it,
the sense of serenity

80
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,723
for months.
The spinner is medical benefits were 

81
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:56,080
hotly contested by news websites with 
nothing better to do.

82
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,210
Apparently they were banned from 
classrooms across the globe.

83
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,480
You could find them everywhere and 
nowhere.

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,033
And what about Catherine Hettinger?
That of course is the great tragedy of 

85
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,960
this story in 2005 and the long dark 
calm before the fidget store,

86
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,243
Hettinger was forced to let her patent 
expire because she couldn't afford $400 

87
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,090
renewal fee.
Since then,

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,953
the inventor of the fidget spinner 
hasn't seen a dime of the prophets of 

89
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,100
the most successful product of all time.

90
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,913
Anything really new in thought and 
material life has to have its source in 

91
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:40,231
something you have to go spiritual.
Nobody can be really creative and unless

92
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:43,180
there's something spiritual behind it,
whether you,

93
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,470
whether it's goes by that name or not,
I mean who invented the house,

94
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,560
who invented any of the things?
We have probably someone engaged in some

95
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,524
kind of search.

96
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,460
