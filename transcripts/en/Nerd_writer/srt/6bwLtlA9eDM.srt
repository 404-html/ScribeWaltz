00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,323
Let's have some fun with physics.
As soon as I finish writing this short 

2
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:08,754
piece of text,
I'm going to delete the document that 

3
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:12,810
contains it from my computer.
The question is,

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:17,340
when I erase these 320,000
bits of information,

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,743
where do they go?
Thermodynamics tells us that matter and 

6
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:24,000
energy can never be destroyed,
only transferred.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,003
Well,
this goes for information to when I 

8
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,174
erase something from my computer,
it's not destroyed but transferred into 

9
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:33,810
heat.
That's why laptops get hot.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,450
That's why computers need fans to cool 
them down.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,210
This law,
the information can never be destroyed,

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,710
holds true everywhere in the universe 
except one place.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,903
Black hole in the 19 seventies,
Steven Hawking showed us that black 

14
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:51,980
holes actually radiate super hot energy 
from their event horizons.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,860
The place where everything even light is
irrevocably do.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,933
This meant crucially that black holes 
get smaller and smaller and evaporate 

17
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:04,110
over time,
eventually disappearing altogether.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,320
This is like the universe erasing its 
own word document,

19
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,530
except for what we've already said can 
never be destroyed.

20
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:15,531
Information looks like here actually is 
and the information paradox was born.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,400
Scientists have a love hate relationship
with paradoxes over the years.

22
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:24,480
Many have tried to solve the information
paradox and we'll talk about a few here,

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,543
but first,
Jacob Bekenstein knowing that he could 

24
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,344
never actually read the information 
inside a black hole Bekenstein resolve 

25
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:36,510
to figure out how much hidden 
information otherwise known as entropy.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,060
A given black hole actually contained.
Now,

27
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,894
you'd imagine that the amount of entropy
in a black hole would equal the volume 

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,903
of that black hole,
like the amount of coffee in a coffee 

29
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:52,521
mug equals the volume of that Mug,
but Bekenstein found that in the case of

30
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,454
black holes,
the amount of hidden information inside 

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,873
is not equal to the volume,
but the area of the event horizons 

32
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,070
surface.

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,963
That's pretty crazy.
This means that when inflammation 

34
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,250
approaches a black hole,
it gets plastered onto the event horizon

35
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,430
surface,
like dots on a super hot basketball,

36
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,264
but there's a problem here and I think 
it's time to bring matthew mcconaughey 

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,700
into the equation.
At the end of the movie,

38
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,534
interstellar spoilers,
Matthew mcconaughey goes into a black 

39
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,590
hole when he hits the event horizon.
He seems to be fine.

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,200
There's nothing really surprising about 
that.

41
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,034
We know that eventually mcconaughey is 
going to get ripped to shreds by the 

42
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,754
intense gravity of the black hole 
eventually being smushed into the 

43
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,684
singularity,
but we sort of know that when you cross 

44
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:43,800
the event horizon of a large black hole,
you probably wouldn't feel anything like

45
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,693
the film shows,
but how does this square with what we 

46
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,170
just said,
that all information approaching a black

47
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,710
hole gets hot glue gunned to its event 
horizon.

48
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,880
The answer is here.

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,713
This is a stereogram.
You might remember them from grade 

50
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,714
school.
A Two d image that when looked at for 

51
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:03,550
long enough reveals a hidden picture 
that seems to rise off the plane,

52
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,384
otherwise known as a Hologram.
Notice that the three d info appears 

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,643
highly scrambled into Dick.
This is what's happening to Matthew 

54
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,334
mcconaughey.
What he travels past the event horizon 

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,980
of a black hole.
Everything that happens inside the black

56
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,814
hole is essentially a hologram of the 
information encoded on it's two d 

57
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:27,340
surface mcconaughey would move past the 
event horizon feeling alright?

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,833
Alright,
alright.

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,673
But an observer from outside would see 
him incinerated and spread across the 

60
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,204
surface as particles.
The crazy thing is that both 

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,510
perspectives would be correct.
According to physicists,

62
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,363
Leonard Susskind,
this may be the case for the entire 

63
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,474
universe,
the three dimensional space we live in 

64
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:50,560
and moving every everyday may be in 
effect a Hologram of a lower dimensional

65
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,040
universe.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,873
I'll be it a perfect holiday.
This is called the holographic 

67
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,203
principle.
It doesn't mean that the universe is a 

68
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,630
dream or an illusion or anything like 
that,

69
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,973
but it is as genuinely revolutionary and
idea as relativity was to Tony and 

70
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,000
physics.
We don't know why it works,

71
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:07,834
but every time we try to quantify the 
amount of information in an enclosed 

72
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,880
space,
it's always equal to the surface area of

73
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,714
that space.
I guess it just goes to show that once 

74
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,294
again,
the universe is not intuitive to the 

75
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:25,000
human mind,
but that doesn't mean once again,

76
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,430
we can't figure it out.

77
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,830
Hey everybody,
thanks for watching and thank you to the

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,673
patriotic patrons.
Those 64 of you out there and I was 

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,100
bowled over by the support for this 
channel.

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,670
You can all consider yourself as part of
a special nerd writer club now,

81
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:49,340
and I have a lot of really cool things 
planned for you.

82
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,203
Google hangouts treats you,
you've known you've no idea it's going 

83
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:53,534
to be fun.
Um,

84
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,463
first things first.
I'm going to collect all of your emails 

85
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,290
so that I can send out a weekly or 
biweekly newsletter,

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,870
the Patriot on patrons,
uh,

87
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,340
where you can hear about what's going to
come up.

88
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,100
If you want to be a patriot patron for 
the nerd writer,

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,710
you can pledge as little as $1 to this 
channel.

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,570
If you pledge a little bit more like $5,
you could get a special nerd writer mug.

91
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,010
Oh my God,
I was.

92
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,500
I was so pumped when these came and you 
have no idea.

93
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,690
There's only one left,
but if there's a demand,

94
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I'll definitely order more and get more 
swag and things like that.

95
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,090
And it's just,
it's just,

96
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,060
it's just great.
As always,

97
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:25,730
I'm going to be in comments talking 
about the holographic principle.

98
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,310
Thank you for watching again and I'll 
see you next time.
