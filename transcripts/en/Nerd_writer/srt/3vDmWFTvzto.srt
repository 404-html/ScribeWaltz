1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,220
What's going on?
What's going on?

2
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,890
Tell me what's going on,
what's going on?

3
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,760
What's going on?
What's going on?

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,710
What's going on?
That's the question that Larry Gopnik,

5
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,890
the ill fated protagonist of the Cohen 
Brothers dark comedy.

6
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:32,724
A serious man keeps asking.
It's a reflexive and sort of stupid 

7
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:37,884
question.
One in response to a series of 

8
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,230
unfortunate events that seem to be 
tearing Larry's quiet,

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,130
contented suburban life apart without 
cause.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,993
First his wife demands a divorce.
Then his student tries to blackmail him 

11
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,450
for a passing grade than his neighbor 
infringes on his property.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,300
Then his wife's lover dies and he's 
forced to pay for it.

13
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:00,990
Then his brother gets in trouble with 
the law and he has to pay for that too.

14
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,040
Then his chance at tenure is threatened 
by anonymous hate mail.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,670
The also gets into a car accident,
witnesses the death of his lawyer and is

16
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,680
forced to pay for a record subscription.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,700
Even though I didn't do anything.
Being a Coen brothers movie,

18
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,534
each of these situations compound and 
unfold into one another with surgical 

19
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:20,964
precision,
and they are each individually 

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,423
illustrative of their own batch of 
themes which taken together a sort of 

21
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,820
shape out the central message of the 
movie,

22
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:33,720
like one of those optical illusions that
demonstrate closure.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,703
Of course,
there is no real closure in a serious 

24
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,224
man,
just as there's not really a shape in 

25
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,820
the illusion that doesn't stop Larry 
from seeking it,

26
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:46,320
though he wants to understand what he's 
done to deserve such misfortune,

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,870
seemingly unaware of what the audience 
could see,

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,883
clear as day that it's Larry's inaction 
is constant refrain of haven't done 

29
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,340
anything that causes so many of his 
problems.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,410
Larry knows that actions have 
consequences,

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,610
but inaction has consequences to instead
of grappling with this fact,

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,970
Larry looks for a way to interpret his 
suffering.

33
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,450
Seeking out the counsel of three rabbis,
the first,

34
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:10,284
uh,
junior rabbi lectures Larry on the 

35
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,880
importance of spective.
That's what it is.

36
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,714
Larry.
The second tells a convoluted parable 

37
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,324
about a dentist who finds a message and 
a patient's teeth that never resolves 

38
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,990
itself illustrating the inscrutability 
of God's plan.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,610
And the third rapper,
he,

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,473
elderly wise,
rabbi Marsha refuses to see him 

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,360
altogether,
liberalizing the heavenly silence in the

42
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,194
face of big questions that prompted 
Larry Search for advice in the first 

43
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,630
place.
A lot of the things that Larry,

44
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:40,464
heres our cliches,
like the need to change your 

45
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,780
perspective,
the parking lot,

46
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,740
larry,
and yet many of them are true.

47
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,723
Of course,
cliche and parable are two devices that 

48
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:50,994
people use to understand what's going on
and they're not the only that a serious 

49
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,884
man has to offer.
Larry Son Danny uses music and so does 

50
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,060
their next door neighbor,
Mrs Samsky.

51
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,133
Larry's brother,
uses a complex probability map of the 

52
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,344
universe called the mentality.
Alice and Larry himself teaches the 

53
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,154
theories of physics and mathematics,
namely and equation that seems to 

54
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:16,240
definitively prove the underwriting 
uncertainty of all things.

55
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,320
I want to concede that it's subtle,
clever,

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,920
but at the end of the day,
is it convincing at its core?

57
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,754
This film questions the persuasiveness 
of every interpretive device by placing 

58
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:30,034
them side by side and showing how they 
fail to work together and form any kind 

59
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:33,994
of semblance of coherence.
The koans communicate the real dread of 

60
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,704
a world that's become unreadable and 
they take this failure down to the most 

61
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,330
basic form of interpretation,
the use of language,

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,433
a lot of attention is paid to the 
language of Hebrew and ancient language 

63
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:53,020
that's lost much of its force in the 
modern world.

64
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,760
Indeed,
even in the 19 sixties,

65
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,594
young Danny Gopnik was doing exactly 
what I did when faced with a Torah 

66
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,680
portion to learn from my bar Mitzvah and
he had vinyls.

67
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,543
I had tapes,
but neither of US learned to read or 

68
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,140
understand the Hebrew.
Instead,

69
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,930
we memorize the sounds that to us remain

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,370
right up share

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,413
Danny can't find his place when the time
comes because those symbols are as 

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:22,920
incomprehensible as the mentality is,
and even in English several times in the

73
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:23,754
film,
people are asked to repeat things or 

74
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,590
just hear them as nonsense near Sir my 
sir nea.

75
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,823
So,
so interpretation is how we nailed down 

76
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,360
the world around us.
Word by word,

77
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,223
feeble by feeble equation by equation.
We secure the storm of experience onto 

78
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,733
fixed points,
and when these started to come undone 

79
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,170
and unforeseen circumstances are always 
threatening to do that,

80
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,483
it can be very traumatic.
We like Larry reach for anything that 

81
00:04:56,851 --> 00:05:00,120
can orient us,
explains the appeal of religion,

82
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,330
yet a serious man documents it's ever 
decreasing usefulness in the modern age.

83
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,623
Of course,
this criticism of interpretive methods 

84
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,050
ought to make us realize that we're 
watching a form of interpretation,

85
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,900
the cinematic narrative,
a serious man,

86
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:16,734
a film in which every element is 
ambiguous in which cause and effect the 

87
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,950
engine of any narrative is willfully 
disregarded.

88
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,060
Suggest that film and story are plagued 
by the same problems,

89
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,073
has all the other devices,
despite what Hollywood would have you 

90
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,460
believe.
One of the most confounding things about

91
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:36,930
the film is it's opening prologue of 
short fable filmed in a different aspect

92
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:41,931
ratio about a Jewish couple in the old 
country who stab and maybe kill either a

93
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,554
good Samaritan or a demon.
The prologues meaning and its 

94
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,710
relationship to the rest of the film are
totally nebulous.

95
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:53,820
There's just enough the maddix 
similarity to prompt interpretation,

96
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,133
but once you try,
the only outcome can frustration moving 

97
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:03,050
the viewer into a head space like that 
is neither pretentious nor unwieldy.

98
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It's the effect of a subtle experienced 
and masterful craftsmanship and the Coen

99
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,730
brothers have been doing this for years.
I just didn't understand,

100
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,023
but a serious man is there most explicit
account of oblique but unflinching 

101
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:17,990
philosophy.

102
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,823
I don't understand.
One that remains skeptical about the 

103
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,424
things we believe film,
story and interpretation can do and 

104
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,614
understands that the big philosophical 
truths about human life are 

105
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:35,390
devastatingly symbol.
There is no god.

106
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,690
There is no objective or cosmic purpose 
for us.

107
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,630
People experience joy to varying 
degrees,

108
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:42,464
but everybody suffers.
Anyone can figure these things out with 

109
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:48,770
the small amount of observation,
introspection and study,

110
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,480
and once you do that dim feeling of 
disappointment will always be there,

111
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,250
but there should also be relief.
The kind of relief you can only get when

112
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,084
putting aside questions that are really 
a waste of time because only when the 

113
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,124
reflexive and sort of stupid questions 
are dropped and the better questions be 

114
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,420
asked.
Better questions like whether or not

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,433
mine.

116
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,800
