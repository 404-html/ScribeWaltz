1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,670
What's the scariest painting and Art 
History?

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,753
There are some strong contenders,
like the judgment of Kumbaya by Gerard 

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,133
divvied Hieronymus.
Bosch is rendering the Henry Fuselli 

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,633
nightmare edvard moocs screen,
but there's only ever really been one 

5
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,640
painting that has seriously disturbed 
me.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,630
This one,
Francisco Goya's,

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,520
Saturn devouring his son.
What you're seeing here is the legendary

8
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,000
Spanish painters depiction of the Greek 
Titan cronus,

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,193
who after usurping power from his father
was told a prophecy that one of his own 

10
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,204
sons would do the same,
and you serve him in order to prevent 

11
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,850
this.
Every time his Queen Raya bore a child,

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,200
kronis would eat it.
Unfortunately for him in the end,

13
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,080
ray conspired to hide away their 
youngest son,

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,930
Zeus,
who eventually fulfilled the prophecy,

15
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,170
exiled his father and ended the reign of
the titans.

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,940
The story is a well known Greek myth,
but look at how Goya handles it.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,460
Some key changes jump out right away.
First,

18
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:30,294
in the myth,
cronus devours his children by 

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,960
swallowing them whole.
In fact,

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,823
they remain alive in his stomach.
Goya's painting is a much more gruesome 

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,803
affair.
He takes some inspiration here from 

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,623
Peter Paul Rubens,
a flemish baroque painter who depicted 

23
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,430
the same event as well in Rubin,
Saturn.

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,293
The tightened seems to be sucking the 
life force from his child even for such 

25
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:56,310
a terrifying subject matter.
Ruben's displays all the drama richness,

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,550
even beauty that marks the baroque 
style.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,810
He helped to make famous

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,180
in Goias version.
That beauty is gone.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,130
We're left with a frightened,
crazed monster discovered in the dark as

30
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,760
if by some explorer with a torch who 
wandered into the wrong cave.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,953
Saturn kronis his Roman name as already 
chewed off the head of his child is 

32
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:23,090
black mouth,
opens around the elbow of the left arm,

33
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,180
ready to bite it off.
At the joint is angular.

34
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,580
Body is crouching in an awkward 
position.

35
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:33,581
His hands dig into the spine.
Blood runs down his child's arm and neck

36
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,490
and shoulder,
a startling primary color,

37
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,773
and if we take a closer look,
we notice that this is not a child at 

38
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:44,840
all,
but one of Saturn's kids grown up.

39
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,300
There's something even more terrifying 
in knowing that the victim knew what was

40
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:54,530
happening and tried to fight back,
but what's most disturbing of all,

41
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:59,531
I think is when and where this painting 
was found late in his life.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,633
Francisco Goya purchased a house on the 
outskirts of Madrid called the Quinta 

43
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,783
Dale Sordo,
or the villa of the deaf after its 

44
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,164
previous owner,
and interesting coincidence since by 

45
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,930
that time in his life,
Goya was deaf to his physical and mental

46
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,890
health,
declining.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,753
Goya painted.
14 murals often refer to as the black 

48
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:23,260
paintings directly onto the interior 
walls of his home.

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,410
Saturn devouring his son was in the 
dining room.

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,280
The photographs you're seeing now,
we're taking over 50 years.

51
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,143
After that time,
Goya never mentioned the paintings 

52
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,624
himself.
He never intended for anyone to see 

53
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,870
them.
To this day,

54
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,810
people still puzzle over the meaning of 
the black paintings.

55
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,644
Why was Goya creating these pessimistic 
and fantastical scenes in the solitude 

56
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,103
of his home to understand this,
it might help to go back through his 

57
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,630
career.
He grew up in Zara,

58
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,650
Goza,
Spain,

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,680
the fourth of six children in a lower 
middle class family.

60
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,813
By all accounts,
he was a lighthearted and joyful kid as 

61
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,500
he studied painting in Zara,
goes up,

62
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,363
Madrid and Rome.
His first serious job was at the royal 

63
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:06,934
tapestry factory where he created 
tapestry cartoons to adorn the palaces 

64
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:14,560
and stately homes of the city.
These tapestries take their cue from the

65
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,480
Rococo style,
elegant,

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,433
playful,
light scenes of both nobility and 

67
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,584
peasantry,
enjoying the normal activities of their 

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,690
day.
Goya eventually became the court painter

69
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,260
for King Charles the fourth,
a disappointing monarch,

70
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,183
unlike his father Charles,
the third who was beloved by the people 

71
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:37,951
for enacting reforms that began to bring
secular enlightenment values to Spain in

72
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,480
1793 and unknown

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,993
left Goya,
yet though he still took emissions from 

74
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,590
his royal clientele.
This disease was a dark time

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,513
turning point in his life and art.
You can see it in yard with lunatics 

76
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,500
from 1794.
Bodies Grapple and cry out in anguish.

77
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,210
The difference between this and the 
tapestry cartoons is shocking.

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,020
His hearing gone.
Goya began to see the country around him

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,913
with a grim clarity and a series of 
etchings called Los Capriccio or the 

80
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:10,894
caprices.
He sends up a Spanish culture that is 

81
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,780
both tragic and comic,
a student of the enlightenment himself.

82
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,380
Goya sees the country backsliding on the
road to maternity.

83
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,550
The king is withdrawn and the people are
superstitious,

84
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,533
too stupid to know what they need.
You can see him fusing all the corners 

85
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,080
of his imagination,
the quest for anatomical truth,

86
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,170
the need for social critique and an 
obsession with beasts and creatures.

87
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,390
It's all summed up in this one.
Aptly titled,

88
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,950
the sleep of reason produces monsters.
In the following years,

89
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,020
things got worse for Spain.

90
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,883
Napoleon invaded the country and 
brutally massacred those who resisted 

91
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,323
his campaign.
Goya was witnessed to the bloodshed and 

92
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:57,590
it affected him deeply.
His painting on the subject,

93
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,730
the third of May 18,
oh,

94
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:03,731
eight is a regulatory depiction of war,
resistance and brutality.

95
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,950
Before this war was a highly composed 
theatrical subject.

96
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,200
In painting here,
Goya gives nothing but brute force.

97
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,423
It's emotion unmediated by artifice.
It would be five years until Spain 

98
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,670
regained its thrown.
In the interim,

99
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,090
resistors developed the constitution of 
18,

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,953
12,
which called for liberal reforms like 

101
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,604
national sovereignty,
freedom of the press and free 

102
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:30,230
enterprise,
but on gaining power.

103
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,093
The new King Ferdinand,
the seventh squash the constitution 

104
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,600
right away and arrested those who made 
it Goya,

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,873
withdrew disheartened the country which 
in his youth had reached toward a new 

106
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:46,790
world,
was now swallowed again by autocracy,

107
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,540
scarred by war,
scarred by illness.

108
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,080
He began to paint nightmare scenes onto 
the walls of his home.

109
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,813
In one,
a young man is being eaten by the 

110
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,410
father.
He was prophesied to you.

111
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:04,640
Serve by now.
Goya knows progress isn't assured,

112
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,490
and when it's defeated,
it's not painless,

113
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,110
it's horrific and slow and the victim 
can feel it happening.

114
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,890
There are a lot of ways that you can 
read Saturn devouring his son.

115
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,263
Maybe Goya was trying to exercise the 
demons of his mind or the demons of his 

116
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,244
country,
or maybe he was just trying to paint 

117
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,643
honestly about one terrifying facet of 
man's nature using the skills and 

118
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,660
techniques he learned in pioneered 
through a lifetime.

119
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,110
The black paintings changed the history 
of art,

120
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:40,820
but what's maybe scariest of all is that
Goya didn't care.

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,043
He doesn't care how we read this 
painting because he didn't paint it for 

122
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,214
us or for anyone.
Saturn devouring his son exists beyond 

123
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,094
interpretation.
It's brute force horror without 

124
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,563
mediation,
a monster looking out from a dark wall 

125
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,640
in a dark room.

126
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,290
