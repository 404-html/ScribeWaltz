1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,210
Edward hopper is a special artist for a 
lot of us.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,370
I've always thought of him in a sort of 
romantic way because his paintings evoke

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,400
the same kind of feelings and memories 
in me that I get from the sense of smell

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,740
is if he was channeling directly into my
limbic system,

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,750
excavating moments that were stored 
deeply away,

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,813
a stubborn realist throughout the mini 
changing and often abstract currents of 

7
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:38,980
modern art in the early and mid 20th 
century.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,920
His canvases are clean,
smooth,

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,003
and almost too real,
not real like his contemporary Andrew 

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,531
Wyeth,
for example,

11
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:48,364
who strive for detail and photo realism,
but pulled back by one degree into 

12
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,570
depictions,
slightly more generalized,

13
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:59,890
slightly more detached from place 
history and person in this way.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,000
There's just enough room to put your own
life into hopper's work,

15
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,103
but once inside,
it's impossible not to be closed in and 

16
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:10,840
see that life along his themes.

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,110
Nearly all those themes are present in 
nighthawks.

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,370
Unquestionably the artists,
most famous work themes of loneliness,

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,140
alienation,
voyeurism,

20
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,000
quiet contemplation,
and more.

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,480
The scene depicts for people in New York
City diner at night.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,540
It's meant to be somewhere in Greenwich 
village where hopper lived,

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,553
but decades of exhaustive searching have
concluded that it was never a real 

24
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:33,424
place.
There was one waiter and three patrons 

25
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,364
who is relationships are all ambiguous,
seated so close together in an empty 

26
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:40,684
diner at night.
It's likely that these two know each 

27
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:45,280
other somehow,
but though their hands overlap,

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,730
they don't touch and they're in 
different phases suggest that they could

29
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:52,640
be strangers if not just momentarily 
estranged.

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,003
The main character of the piece seems to
be the diner itself and island of light 

31
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,204
in the outer darkness.
It's diagonal lines are strong 

32
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,714
accentuated by the counter and the 
stools and we're seeing the diner at an 

33
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,860
odd angle as if from the vantage of 
someone crossing the street,

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,300
it's triangular corner juts into the 
frame like the prow of a boat,

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,530
and this is no coincidence.

36
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,560
Not only was hopper obsessed with the 
imagery of boats,

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,603
but he repeatedly situated his buildings
at angles like this and the point of 

38
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:23,314
that I think was to achieve and effect 
in which his subjects were both behind 

39
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,950
and in front of windows.
Of course,

40
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,843
windows are the place where the 
separation between outside and inside 

41
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,050
becomes complicated and not because we 
can physically move through them,

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,943
but because our site does,
because our gaze invades these private 

43
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,860
worlds.
Indeed in hopper's work,

44
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,694
the windows often appear as if they're 
not even there as opposed to someone 

45
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,060
like Norman Rockwell who had a talent 
for giving glass,

46
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:56,980
a texture hoppers windows vanish.
They invite that voyeuristic look,

47
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,390
knowing that houses like people can be 
penetrated with a gaze.

48
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,320
Copper was a very slow,
very deliberate painter.

49
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,550
He took months to finish a canvas and 
made several sketches and studies before

50
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:13,170
embarking on the final piece in these 
sketches for Nighthawks,

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,013
we can see hopper out on the street 
looking for the right back angle for 

52
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,350
this man modifying to find the perfect 
effect.

53
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,110
Here's his sketches of Josephine,
his wife,

54
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,000
who modeled for the woman in the 
painting.

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,460
Here's her right hand holding a 
cigarette,

56
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:31,000
which he eventually transplanted to her 
partner hopper,

57
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,834
wanted his devotion to each work to be 
mirrored by our appreciation as slowly 

58
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,234
and deliberately as he painted.
He wanted us to look really look to be 

59
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,850
made vulnerable as a viewer,
always is whether he or she is crouching

60
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,870
in the dark and the building opposite or
simply crossing the street.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,360
There's no door to the diner and 
nighthawks,

62
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,403
no way in except by way of site.
That site enters the fluorescent light 

63
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,923
of the establishment,
passes through the three patrons in 

64
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:01,714
there on wheat and loneliness and exits 
into the dark for bidding night behind 

65
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,694
them.
You know I,

66
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,563
I wonder about that.
Darkness hopper tried very hard to on 

67
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,030
more his work from the historical 
moment.

68
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,750
You didn't want only to be judged in the
context of his time and place,

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,133
but it's worth noting that this painting
was completed in the weeks and days 

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,233
following the bombing of Pearl Harbor 
when everyone in New York City was 

71
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:25,804
paranoid about another attack,
the city held blackout drills a way to 

72
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:33,190
practice hiding the city in darkness.
If an aerial assault ever came,

73
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,940
but hopper didn't care,
his studio lights stayed on.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,833
As his wife wrote in her diary,
ed refuses to take any interest in the 

75
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,244
very likely prospect of being bombed.
This was the atmosphere in which night 

76
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:47,184
hawks was Ford.
Did it have an influence on the 

77
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,590
painting?
I don't know.

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,370
The future was very uncertain at this 
moment in time,

79
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:58,720
as uncertain as the darkness that frames
the patrons of the Steiner,

80
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,900
a darkness there launched into by 
hoppers composition and our gaze.

81
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,230
The artist was obsessed with light,
how it fell on houses,

82
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,850
on people through windows.

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,713
The colors that made hopper seemed to 
disregard the chaos in the world around 

84
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:14,854
him,
but is it a coincidence that like his 

85
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,520
studio,
the light of the nighthawk,

86
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:22,030
Steiner seems to be the last light still
shining in the city,

87
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,573
and for this reason,
I think you can find a slightly more 

88
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:30,220
optimistic reading of this painting.
What is there to do in the face of great

89
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:35,110
disquiet and doubt,
but work and live on all the poppers.

90
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:37,990
People seem to be huddled up against the
present moment.

91
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,340
Lonely.
Yes.

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,510
Waiting maybe a little board people have
nighthawks are no different,

93
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,140
but boredom is exactly when we feel time
and being the most acutely.

94
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,123
It can inspire a profound mood.
Maybe that's what these people are 

95
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,560
feeling alone together in their lighted 
ship,

96
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,980
sailing against the darkness of all that
was yet to come.

97
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,623
The yellowish greenish fluorescent light
in this scene like the light and hopper 

98
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:10,130
studio is a meager substitute for the 
brilliance of the sun,

99
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,300
but it can through giant windows still 
illuminated the world.

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,540
Hey everybody.
Thanks for watching.

101
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,550
Nighthawks is one of my favorite 
paintings ever.

102
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,720
So that was just a lot of fun to make.
So two big announcements.

103
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,170
One,
we are about to hit 100,000

104
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:35,290
subscribers on the nerd writer channel.
It might be at 100,000

105
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,460
by the time this video goes out.

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Ah,

107
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,670
that's amazing.
I've been doing this for over four years

108
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,563
and it's been amazing and fun and 
exciting and fascinating from the very 

109
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,920
start.
So thank you to everyone who's been with

110
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:55,100
me from the beginning,
who's come on recently and everything in

111
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,330
between.
Um,

112
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,580
the nerdwriter is,
it's,

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,050
you know,
it's my profession,

114
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:02,450
that's my career and it's everything 
that I want to do.

115
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,284
So there's gonna be a lot more of it.
The other big news is that we crossed 

116
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,060
the thousand dollars on the Patriot on 
this week,

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
uh,
and I just have to thank you so much for

118
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,714
that.
Um,

119
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,733
you know,
we're right at the beginning now of 

120
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,470
what's making this financially feasible 
for me.

121
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:20,471
So thank you for pledging on patron to 
the nerd writer if you haven't already,

122
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,820
I'd love for you to pledge to this 
project,

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,833
um,
and help me keep making these videos 

124
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:25,994
because there is so much more stuff that
I want to do more painting analysis and 

125
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,690
film analysis and understanding art.
But a lot of other cool stuff too.

126
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,220
Um,
that will be coming your way soon.

127
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,060
So thank you again and I will see you 
guys next Wednesday.
