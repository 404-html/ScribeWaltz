1
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,470
As a filmmaker,
Christopher Nolan always wants to walk a

2
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,304
fine line if there's one fundamental 
theme that suffuses his entire 

3
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:29,044
filmography,
it's that cinema as a shared narrative 

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,313
can be a hugely powerful cultural force.
I'm far from the first to notice for 

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,880
mentioned that many of his films 
reference film itself that,

6
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,743
for example,
the inception team bears a strong 

7
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,450
resemblance to a film crew,
but interestingly though,

8
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:53,170
a lot of his work could be called Meta 
cinematic.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,513
Nolan is extremely careful about 
avoiding medicine amatic images in his 

10
00:00:58,361 --> 00:00:59,950
work.
For example,

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,873
in the established Batman Continuity,
Bruce Wayne and his parents are out to 

12
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:09,490
see the mask of Zorro film before the 
fateful double murder.

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,020
That insights,
the dark nights,

14
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,930
whole saga in Batman begins,
however,

15
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,823
Nolan's retelling of that origin,
the Wayne's are out to the opera 

16
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,330
Mephistopheles instead.
That change is a purposeful one.

17
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,463
As Nolan has said in an interview,
we didn't have young Bruce Wayne going 

18
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,750
to see zero because it character in a 
movie.

19
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,583
Watching a movie is very different than 
a character in a comic book watching a 

20
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:33,394
movie,
it creates a deconstructionist thing 

21
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:36,754
that we were trying to avoid.
The reason Nolan tries to avoid this is 

22
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:41,254
because over and above everything,
his cinema has always been about 

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,023
immersion,
bringing you into a story so fully that 

24
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:53,260
the edges disappear and you're carried 
along by the narrative momentum.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,410
This is the line that Nolan wants to 
walk.

26
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,520
He wants to be immersive and medicine 
and at the same time,

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,570
in other words,
he wants to hide in plain sight.

28
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,870
Hiding in plain sight is essentially the
subject matter of Nolan's fifth film and

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,130
my favorite,
the prestige.

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,030
You could almost call this film Meta,
Meta cinematic,

31
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:16,864
and that it functions as a kind of rule 
book for how to achieve this immersive 

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,990
effect without seeming 
deconstructionist.

33
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,440
To use Nolan's words,
just take the first sequence.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,573
The first thing you see is the film 
title over a mysterious shot of several 

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,300
mislaid top hats in the woods.
The text here is,

36
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:37,690
of course the title card,
but if you know the film,

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,583
you know that this text also has a 
literal function because these hats are 

38
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,323
the prestige of the prestige itself.
The second clue is in their number 

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,440
doubles,
copies,

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,860
multiplicity.
It's the key to understanding the tricks

41
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:57,310
of this film,
and this is echoed in the second shot as

42
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:01,960
well with bird cages of identical 
canaries from here,

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,830
Michael Caine's character goes onto 
describe how a magic trick works.

44
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,800
It'd be magic trick consists of three 
poles,

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,140
the pledge,
the turn,

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,190
and finally the prestige.
The sequence carefully sets up the films

47
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,083
own pledges that is borden and Angie are
played by Christian Bale and Hugh 

48
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,983
Jackman respectively while illustrating 
it's method through Michael Caine's 

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,510
voiceover and his trick for the little 
girl,

50
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,620
but the film is playing its own tricks 
here through editing.

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,750
Where is this voiceover coming from?
Usually in film a voiceover mean someone

52
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,040
commenting on the events being shown 
from sometime in the future and when the

53
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,874
scene ends,
it cuts to the courtroom scene of 

54
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,290
borden's murder trial.
Picking up the last phrase,

55
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,770
as if Michael Caine's whole explanation 
was testimony.

56
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,120
It's not until the very end of the film 
that we learned that the bird trick with

57
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:55,690
the girl is chronologically.
The last moment in the film,

58
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,553
Nolan reverses the temporal relationship
between the voiceover and the scene 

59
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:03,580
under it,
and this kind of displacement is the key

60
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:04,414
mechanism for the whole movie.
The Prestige is all about a trick that 

61
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:12,130
moves its object through time and space 
instantaneously.

62
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,203
Well,
this is exactly what all film editing 

63
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,144
does.
Most of editing cuts between short 

64
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:18,784
distances and continuous times.
Indeed with a simple cut that's what 

65
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,520
most people expect,
but that seems simple.

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,353
Cut can traverse great distances also 
and great lengths of time in either 

67
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,304
direction.
Nolan has described learning the power 

68
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:37,030
of this by watching terrence Malik's,
the thin red line in which Malik cuts to

69
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:41,380
memories simply without blurs or fades 
or wavy lines,

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,320
and the powerful effect this can have on
a viewer.

71
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,603
The Prestige exploits this power to the 
extreme cutting between multiple 

72
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:53,210
different nested memories.
Nolan sets up this device with board and

73
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:57,370
an engineer's respective journals,
but once these devices are established,

74
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,760
he cuts between the narratives at will 
and without warning.

75
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,653
In this way,
the prestige demonstrates a unique 

76
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:08,110
capacity of film without compromising 
the audience's suspended disbelief.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
The complex narrative structure is 
totally subservient to the story Nolan 

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
wants to tell.
It's necessary to keep its twists secret

79
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:16,354
until the film wants to reveal them.
This is Christopher Nolan's great gift 

80
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:23,800
as a filmmaker.
He's so intune with the dynamics of film

81
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,280
narrative,
but he can construct a plot with so much

82
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:31,300
forward momentum that even when he gives
you all the clues,

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,080
you remain at his mercy until the very 
final shot.

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,463
Now,
if this was the only lesson of the 

85
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:39,324
prestige,
I'd be satisfied and calling it a great 

86
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,160
film,
but there's one scene here easily missed

87
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,830
that adds a final important point.
I think

88
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,950
it's fine.
You can watch the prestige and enjoy the

89
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:10,070
story for what it is.
That's what Nolan wants for us.

90
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,220
He wants us to be amazed and as the film
itself says,

91
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,270
most of us want to be fooled,
but all films,

92
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,370
even one as tightly wellmed as this 
invite a probing.

93
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,213
I,
as the boy sees into the bird trick we 

94
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,930
can see into cinema and we're accustomed
to taking most editing for granted,

95
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:32,774
but the way stories are told,
the tools of any storytelling medium in 

96
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:40,730
large part determined the way we 
construct our own memories,

97
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,743
shared or personal.
This is all to say that studying film 

98
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,300
doesn't kill it's magic.
It feeds that magic back

99
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,390
into the real world.

100
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,173
