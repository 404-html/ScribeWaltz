1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,480
Like artists,
filmmakers have a unique set of tools at

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,980
their disposal,
cameras,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,090
lenses,
lights,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,260
microphones,
music,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,920
and they use these tools to tell their 
story or set a scene.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,730
The director,
David Lynch has of course the same tools

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:18,564
as everybody else,
but lynch manipulates more than just 

8
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,164
these physical instruments more deeply 
and more strangely than any other 

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:29,970
director I know of.
He uses expectation as a tool.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,013
He wields expectation,
the expectation that comes from what we 

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,430
know about film,
about its history,

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,264
the history of stories,
and from our humanity with the same 

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,893
nuance and power and someone else might 
use light to create a variety of moods 

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,533
in a space.
Today I want to look at how Lynch 

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,760
manipulates our expectations in a single
scene from his masterpiece.

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,810
Mulholland drive the guidance towards 
some interesting emotional territory.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,140
Let's scene I'm talking about is one of 
my favorite ever.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,290
The audition scene where betty played by
Naomi Watts,

19
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,124
tries out for a part in a small movie.
We later learn is called the Sylvia 

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,803
North Story.
The scene occurs about halfway through 

21
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,144
the film.
Betty has come to Hollywood bright eyed 

22
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,900
and bushy tailed to be a movie star.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,361
Oh,
of course.

24
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,730
I'd rather be known as a great actress 
than a movie star,

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,310
but you know,
sometimes people end up being both.

26
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,320
She's staying at her aunt's house where 
she discovers Rita,

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,243
a woman who's been in a car accident and
has lost all her memory or expectations 

28
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,204
for the audition have already been set 
up by much of what we've witnessed 

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,053
leading up to the scene.
Betty doesn't seem to be a character 

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,174
with much internal depth or darkness or 
flatness of affect is even parodied in 

31
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,460
her very first scene at the airport 
where the dialogue is clearly overdubbed

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,050
and fake.
Okay,

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,903
Irene,
the day her blind kindness makes her 

34
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,634
vulnerable to exploitation.
She doesn't even really care that a 

35
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:53,960
stranger is living in her aunt's house.
So coming into the audition were feeling

36
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:56,900
a couple of things were somewhat 
invested in Betty success.

37
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:57,734
A basic expectation for any protagonist,
but we're wary of some danger that may 

38
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,214
be in store because of her innocence and
we have little or no expectation that 

39
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,080
she will impress with her acting chops.

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,090
Why don't you join woody over there and 
we'll play the scene,

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,313
and of course the last thing to mention 
is that we've already seen this scene 

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,830
played out once before back at the house
or a practice round,

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,440
a tryout for a trial with betty and 
Rita.

44
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,470
You're still here.
I came back.

45
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,723
I thought that's what you wanted.
Nobody wants you here in this first 

46
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,290
reading.
The scene is revealed to be trite,

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,153
the dialogue cliched and melodramatic,
but he's character rebukes her father's 

48
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:40,820
friend who is trying to seduce her for 
the second time it seems,

49
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:44,330
and she moves closer and closer.
As for threats become more stern,

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,480
the two women can't even finish without 
laughing at the soap opera,

51
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,710
quality of the script,

52
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,120
crowded,
crying,

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,630
cry,
and then I say with big emotion,

54
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,000
I drove.
I hate us both.

55
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,400
So a universe of expectation has been 
laid out for the viewer.

56
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,670
Will see in a second how those 
expectations will work as a trap.

57
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,220
But at the start,
everything in the audition room seems to

58
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
reinforce what we already think,
that people are about as stiff as the 

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,170
wood paneling that he's reading,
partner what he looks like a star of all

60
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,630
my children who spent a little too much 
time in the sun.

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,450
The director is absent minded and 
laughable.

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,720
So when the scene begins and woody 
corrals betty into his slimy grasp,

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,410
what triggers first is our awareness of 
how vulnerable she is,

64
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,413
and then when she pushes him away,
we don't know if she's reacting as 

65
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:38,071
herself or as the character than woody 
moves to put his hands below her waist,

66
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,263
and something incredible happens.
A transformation so sudden that the 

67
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,734
viewer experiences whiplash as the 
critic George tolls notes were lured 

68
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,740
into engaging emotionally with the 
scene.

69
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,880
When lynch triggers our expectation that
betty might be exploited.

70
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,360
We've dropped our guard a little,
but it's already too much.

71
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,390
We've surrendered enough so that when 
Lynch switches the bait,

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
we're left in awe at what happens next.
I.

73
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,590
It's not that difficult.
He trusts you

74
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,240
all throughout the film.
From the overdub dialogue on down,

75
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,600
David Lynch has made us privy to the 
veneer of things.

76
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,770
It's all curiously two dimensional and 
that puts us on our card.

77
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,903
Since surfaces are what we get,
lynch encourages us to examine those 

78
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:42,894
surfaces,
always remaining detached enough for a 

79
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,370
disinterested,
critical view of what we're seeing,

80
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,640
but as with everything that Lynch does,
this two dimensionality,

81
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:51,474
this flatness is also a deception.
I know you said you would entertain 

82
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:59,040
suggestions and that's all anybody here 
is asking you to do.

83
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,720
What are you talking about?
While we think we're on our guard,

84
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,200
superior to the clawing emotions of 
Hollywood wish fulfillment,

85
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,363
Lynch relishes dropping the bottom out,
showing us just how unprepared and 

86
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,500
susceptible we are to emotions that our 
society,

87
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,680
treasurers or deeply fierce in a scene 
that mirrors the audition.

88
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,450
Betty and Rita go to a place called 
club.

89
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,300
Silencio were a special show is 
underway.

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,430
The host repeats again and again.

91
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,163
No,

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,990
and everything you're hearing he says is
a tape recording.

93
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,680
Expectations for the scene are made 
totally explicit.

94
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,170
Then a woman comes out and sings,
a truly heartbreaking Spanish version of

95
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:53,150
Roy orbison's crying lynch pushes tight 
into her face in an extreme closeup,

96
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,060
and the film begins to taunt us.

97
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,260
Hey,

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,660
what's at stake here?
As in any movie is belief.

99
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,650
Can the director of make you believe the
artifice being presented to you?

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,083
It's why directors use expectations.
We incorporated from other films when 

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,470
two people lock eyes for the first time 
and the camera pushes in.

102
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,130
That's love at first sight,
and this is one way to generate belief.

103
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:30,964
The definition of expectation is a 
strong belief that something will 

104
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:38,110
happen,
but lynch goes a step further.

105
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,950
In one way,
he sets up an expectation than lures you

106
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:45,250
into believing the opposite,
so when the rug is pulled out,

107
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,530
the audience is left,
suspended,

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,060
caught out,
and captured,

109
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:49,923
engaging fully with the terrifying 
nothingness that they were warned 

110
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:56,170
against.
When the film finally takes it's hard,

111
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,004
right?
Turn revealing Betty's true story of 

112
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,163
pain and degradation.
We're confronted again with the same 

113
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,524
feeling,
believing we're going to get the key to 

114
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:04,684
the mystery,
but instead are only sunk deeper into 

115
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:08,314
the dream and it's worth noting by the 
way that this all comes from an 

116
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:15,631
expectation that goes unfulfilled,
but the audition scene plays the reverse

117
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:17,530
feeling,
and I think this is important.

118
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,830
Instead of pulling the rug out to reveal
an abyss,

119
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,113
we come in fully prepared and analytical
only to be dropped into a space of raw 

120
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,740
and honest emotion,
even though we know it's active,

121
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,593
even though we know this is a film,
were entranced totally believing the 

122
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:35,464
moment,
not because our expectations were 

123
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:40,030
fulfilled,
but because they were subverted in a way

124
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,031
that we didn't think was possible,
and now I say with big emotion,

125
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:46,750
I drove

126
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,703
not content with the dreams that 
Hollywood has been feeding us and mass 

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,023
for decades.
David Lynch uses cliched expectation to 

128
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,304
move us into the spaces.
Film has yet to go showing us the 

129
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:14,740
dangers and the hopes of believable.

130
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,800
I can't believe it.

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,220
That's a lot of lynch in a week period.
Anyway,

132
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,500
thank you very much for watching.
Happy Wednesday.

133
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,723
Thank you so much guys,

134
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:40,050
a couple of weeks ago to support.
It just just makes me feel good.

135
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,690
I have to think squarespace for 
sponsoring this video.

136
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,553

141
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:59,100
Thank you everybody again.
I will see you next Wednesday.
