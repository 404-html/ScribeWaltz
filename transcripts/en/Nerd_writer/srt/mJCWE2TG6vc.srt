1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,890
Coffee on a Tuesday and blog 21.

2
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,900
So I have this thing about bookstores 
whenever I walked by them.

3
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,734
It's sort of like,
you know how in Vegas they pump scented 

4
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,910
air through the casinos to make the 
gamblers feel good.

5
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:34,200
Well,
whenever I walked by a bookstore,

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,213
I get the smell of books in my face and 
I just have to go in and I could spend 

7
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,384
all day in there.
The reason I usually leave is because I 

8
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,243
start to get light headed and realize 
that I'd miss lunch and it's coming up 

9
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:44,754
on dinner and people are expecting me 
and I have to do this thing and write 

10
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:47,934
that email and move on with my day.
And maybe it's not smart for one to 

11
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,170
analyze the charm of bookstores.
But.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,513
Well,
I've already sort of started it and 

13
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,894
anyway,
I read this article in the Times 

14
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,300
yesterday and and it's got me thinking 
about it.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,133
See the article said that Barnes and 
noble has predicted that in the coming 

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,960
year it will lose more money than even 
Wall Street had predicted it would.

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,000
And this after the bankruptcy and 
disillusion of borders,

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,983
its main competitor is the specter of 
ebooks with Amazon and it's kindle as a 

19
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,380
dominant force,
threatens to diminish this,

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,260
this last chain of booksellers,
and if they do,

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,273
you might be left buying your your best 
sellers at places like target or 

22
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,444
Walmart.
And it's ironic because it was barnes 

23
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:30,084
and noble,
which drove so many independent 

24
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,493
booksellers to bankruptcy,
sort of like what Tom Hanks does to Meg 

25
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,090
Ryan and you've got mail

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,150
with his multilevel,
homogenize the world Mochaccino land.

27
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:40,380
Now

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,730
mochaccino land might be the last best 
hope for print books and publishers like

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,593
penguin and Random House and Simon and 
Schuster who used that front of the 

30
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,044
store display table to premier new 
talent to push the next big thing at 

31
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:52,774
table,
which is especially important for new 

32
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,480
writers like me now to fight off the 
kindle.

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,403
Barnes and noble has the nook and it has
boosted some revenue to the company 

34
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,740
though it's hard to fight off both 
Amazon and apple at the same time.

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,920
David had enough trouble fighting just 
the one goliath.

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,830
William Lynch,
the new CEO of Barnes and noble has done

37
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,380
everything he possibly can to stay 
relevant and ahead of the curve,

38
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,214
but his company is worth this much while
Amazon's is worth this much and I guess 

39
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,554
we'll see how it plays out,
but I pause to wonder if there is 

40
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,940
something lost by the digitizing of 
books in the possible end of bookstores.

41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,253
It's safe to say that someone reading a 
book on their kindle or Nook is having 

42
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,760
an experience which is negligibly 
different from reading a paper book.

43
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,594
The story is still there.
The words arrange as they are still 

44
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,840
produced,
the same magic,

45
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:41,640
the same music of mental images that 
only pros can make that won't be lost.

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,150
I guess what I fear is not the death of 
stories,

47
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:48,030
but rather the end of the physical 
space,

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,613
which those stories take up walking 
through the stacks and shelves of the 

49
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:55,830
bookstore.
All our past and present knowledge looms

50
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,664
cast shadows on you and maybe you get 
more accurate of sense with all that 

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,560
papered space of the distance.
We've come as a thinking rice.

52
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,080
It's like a real living interactive 
timeline.

53
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,750
It's not the same with a selection of 
ebooks on your ipad.

54
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,550
It's no space,
they're just scrolling.

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,193
You can't see each and every page tight 
against the next and you can't see the 

56
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,184
overstock or the display table or the 
books people have taken out of their 

57
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,834
shells but decided not to buy.
So there's a million variables in the 

58
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,600
bookstore variable stretched over space 
and time,

59
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
and it's true that sometimes a book like
a magic rain can find you

60
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,320
and maybe there's an alchemy in that,
which would be a shame to lose.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
Or maybe I'm just being sentimental.

62
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,490
The amount Susanna.
