1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,360
Colson,
get back to base.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,190
This is a level seven.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,680
As of right now,
we are at war.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,413
We do.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,043
One of the things you got to love about 
just weeding is that he rarely lets a 

6
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:30,370
detail go to waste.
My favorite example is what you just saw

7
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:35,371
from the first avengers movie when he 
uses the film title card literally as an

8
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:39,580
answer to a question that's been posed 
by a character on screen.

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,743
It's a great little joke because it sets
the tone for the whole movie by drawing 

10
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,350
attention to the films.
Packaging Wieden is letting us know that

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,513
he knows that this is just a movie,
that it's not going to take itself too 

12
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:54,530
seriously and that there are going to be
jokes that matters.

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,483
Playing Gallagher,
he does a similar thing at the end of 

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,050
avengers to using a creative cut that 
literally plants a word in your head.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,290
Fleet.
We're all thinking of the same word.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,690
No.
Now maybe

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,523
it's a small thing,
but the way art is packaged has always 

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,273
fascinated me because packaging like 
this is just another thing that the 

19
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,540
artists has to choose it all to be a 
creative decision,

20
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,810
like all the creative decisions that 
went into the work itself.

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,093
Of course,
when you're dealing with big properties 

22
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,840
and millions of dollars,
artists don't always or even usually get

23
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,630
to choose what a film or a book title is
going to be.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,673
The book cover or the movie poster is 
often designed with commercial 

25
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,364
incentives in mind,
but that's not the case for all art 

26
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:47,300
forms or even all forms of packaging.
We didn't obviously had to name his film

27
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:48,134
the Avengers,
but he found an interesting way to work 

28
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,670
that title into the film.
Similarly,

29
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:53,504
in the 2006 James Bond Movie Casino 
Royale director Martin Campbell and the 

30
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:57,884
bond team,
we're looking to reboot the franchise 

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,820
for a post Austin powers.

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,653
Posts can't be era to make it more 
gritty and in line with the best action 

33
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:09,710
films of the time.
Obviously they had to include the iconic

34
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:13,460
gunbarrel sequence,
but by foregoing the normal.dot

35
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,430
dot gunbarrel,
instead working it into the story,

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,460
they broadcast the message that this 
bond is a different beast altogether.

37
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,820
My interest in this kind of packaging,
I think springs from epigraphs.

38
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,400
Those quotes you see at the beginning of
books,

39
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,323
I use graphs to signal that the reader 
should look in this direction while 

40
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:36,290
reading that they should keep certain 
things in mind pass.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,510
That's a favorite writer of mine,
m John Harrison,

42
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,344
who I think hits the point exactly 
epigraphs indeed all the trappings that 

43
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:46,850
exist in and around a work of art are in
some way a part of it.

44
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,963
Their instructions or simply suggestions
on how to receive the project in 

45
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,084
question.
This is a good example from Terentino's 

46
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,454
grindhouse feature death proof,
which couches the story in the look and 

47
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,084
feel of exploitation genre movies of the
19 seventies all the way down to the 

48
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,180
grainy film stock and the fake trailers 
for similarly styled b movies.

49
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,410
These kinds of touches,
they're not directly part of the

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,533
self paint.
The immediate space around the movie 

51
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,654
with a kind of aura that sets the mood.
Of course there are plenty of examples 

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,830
of beautiful title sequences going back 
through the history of film.

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,873
The king of them all is Saul Bass,
the designer behind everything from 

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,620
psycho and Vertigo to Goodfellas and 
casino,

55
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,780
and here's how bass use his job.
I had

56
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,383
time.
That's the audience involvement with a 

57
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:40,574
film should really begin with the very 
first frame seemed to be a real 

58
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:44,744
opportunity to use titles in a new way,
actually create a climate for the story 

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,920
that was about to unfold.

60
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,960
That's his philosophy of establishing 
the film is the climate lives on.

61
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:59,230
Even if extended title sequences are 
becoming a little less common.

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,423
Actually,
I've been noticing a lot of these title 

63
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,410
sequences moving to the end of films.
The closing credits of Blue Valentine,

64
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,400
for example,
features,

65
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,503
quick firework,
glimpses of the relationship that just 

66
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,300
ended with the film.
I remember watching these credits in the

67
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,134
theater and being completely transfixed 
as they send your mind back across the 

68
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,540
story,
making the heartbreak of the ending even

69
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,240
more poignant and on the complete other 
side of the spectrum,

70
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,074
the closing credit sequence of 22 jump 
street is a brilliant send up of 

71
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,830
Hollywood's franchise mentality of 
endless sequels.

72
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,863
It's maybe the first time I've ever seen
a credit sequence that is even funnier 

73
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,063
than and already hilarious movie.
One of the examples I love most is the 

74
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,930
title sequence from Francoise Truffaut's
adaptation of Fahrenheit 4:51,

75
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,130
a story about a society that doesn't 
allow it to citizens to read books,

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,440
so to banish words from the viewer's 
mind.

77
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,710
Truffaut has the opening titles read 
aloud.

78
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,843
Instead,

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm a novel by Ray Bradbury music by 
comment back to a photography.

80
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,684
Nicholas Roeg.

81
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,223
Not every film or every piece of art 
needs to pay so much attention to the 

82
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,154
packaging that surrounds it,
but I love something like this because 

83
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:13,694
it actually adds to the story.
The same could be said for the title 

84
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,414
sequence of the wire,
which entwines fragments of all the 

85
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:21,314
narrative perspectives of the show and 
even some footage from the episodes 

86
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,103
themselves and puts them on an equal 
footing reinforcing creator David 

87
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,223
Simon's maxim that the wire is not about
Jim McNulty or Avon Barksdale or crime 

88
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:38,750
or punishment or drugs or violence.
It's about the city.

89
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,470
These titles I think do a little more 
than echo the theme.

90
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,783
They helped to develop it.
All artists are trying in some way to 

91
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:47,894
get their intentions across to an 
audience even if that intention is to 

92
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:54,500
make the packaging around their work as 
minimal as possible.

93
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,543
A number of painters don't title their 
canvases example or simply named them 

94
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,570
with a number.

95
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,960
The idea here is to take the work on its
own terms.

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,033
Movies and books don't have that option,
but when woody allen uses the same font 

97
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,250
and title sequence for every single 
movie he's ever done,

98
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,600
the point I think is to look beyond the 
titles to the film itself,

99
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,740
but even that nondecision is a kind of 
decision.

100
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,500
I mean,
the title isn't the most important thing

101
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,334
about a movie,
but attention to detail is something 

102
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,320
that I appreciate as a film goer.
I mean,

103
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,154
if you're going to spend all that time 
and all that money making a feature 

104
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,384
film,
why not try to make everything in and 

105
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,420
around it?
Meaning,

106
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,850
forget it.
I can't go in two minutes.

107
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,140
Sorry.
I can't do it.

108
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,460
We've blown it already.
I,

109
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:43,100
you know,
I can't go into,

110
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,590
in a minute in the Middle East,
the titles there in Swedish,

111
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,920
there is a nerd writer video every 
Wednesday.

112
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,040
So if you click that box right there,
you'll subscribe to this channel and get

113
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,874
all the videos.

114
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,890
My girlfriend is just scared the shit 
out of me.

115
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,650
I have to think squarespace for 
sponsoring this video.

116
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,690
They make sleek,
intuitive websites.

117
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,670
I just made one called the nerd 
writer.net.

118
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:13,810
You can check that out.
Um,

119
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,973
and if you sign up for a year and you 
get a free domain name and if you use 

120
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,124
the offer code nerdwriter,
you can get 10 percent off your first 

121
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,310
purchase.
Also,

122
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,040
me and my girlfriend are going to be 
living in Venice,

123
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,860
Italy for the next month,
starting Friday.

124
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,420
So if you live out there,
if you,

125
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,710
uh,
if you want to get in touch,

126
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:30,544
you can email me at [inaudible] dot 
[inaudible] at Gmail and I will see you 

127
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,050
guys next Wednesday.
The rest of you,

128
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,280
hopefully I see some of you in Venice.
