00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
Another day,
another 10th flog coffee on a Tuesday 

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,480
and blog for.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,833
For me,
it's about stories I'm drawn to art 

4
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:22,780
forms that availed themselves of stories
and the development of character because

5
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:27,781
I love hearing about how people choose 
to get along in their century or less of

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,843
life within stories.
There are genres and sub genres that I 

7
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,354
find particularly interesting because of
their capacities to eliminate certain 

8
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:37,660
parts of our experience that we may be 
hiding from ourselves.

9
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:38,494
For example,
maybe we tell ourselves that we're free 

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,043
in control,
that there's a plan or a person guiding 

11
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,680
us,
that reality is hard,

12
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:48,070
like a stone and knowable.
It's an important function of fiction to

13
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:50,950
tear these things down.
In this vein,

14
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,450
one of my favorite genres is cyberpunk,
a projection of postmodernism,

15
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,284
which is itself a refutation of general 
theories and drawing heavily on science 

16
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,024
fiction.
Cyberpunk is a reaction to the 

17
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,484
information age,
the age of the personal computer 

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,080
established in the work of William 
Gibson's neuromancer series.

19
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:08,914
Cyberpunk features the interaction of 
high tech and low light as Lawrence 

20
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,270
Pearson describes it.

21
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,700
Classic cyberpunk characters were 
marginalized,

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,620
alienated loners who lived on the edge 
of society in generally dystopic futures

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,483
were daily life was impacted by rapid 
technological change and ubiquitous 

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,350
datasphere computerized information and 
invasive modification of the human body.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,213
What makes cyber punk still compelling,
I think is that a lot of these things 

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,000
are already prevalent.
The Internet,

27
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,070
social media,
artificial organs,

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,933
augmented reality,
and most recently the Google glass now 

29
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,680
that our future will become dystopic.
Well,

30
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,573
that's a stretch,
but this is fiction and I don't think 

31
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:47,790
it's really the point of science fiction
to be predicted.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,633
There's a deeper level in cyber punk and
I think that it's captured best in the 

33
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:52,474
film blade runner.
I think cinema is uniquely suited to 

34
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,640
cyber punk because it has the advantages
of the visual and auditory,

35
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,474
the neon moving lights,
the little ting longing music of the 

36
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:02,014
brilliant Vangelis.
I mean as soon as that first note goes 

37
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,180
bad and the brilliant score to blade 
runner before the credits or even over,

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,940
you know exactly what the movie is going
to convey here.

39
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,803
Just take alice

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,570
gives me chills every time.
Blade runner's meticulous,

41
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:39,404
romanticization of cyber punk,
I think is key to understanding its 

42
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,730
power.
I think that the breakdown in the social

43
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,470
order,
the overload of information,

44
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:46,304
the sheer size and incomprehensibility 
of this kind of dystopia appeals to an 

45
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:54,470
important part in every one of us.
It's the desire to surrender,

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,590
to succumb to the quite apparent truth,
that everything means nothing.

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,663
It's my idea,
and I admit that it's a controversial 

48
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,470
one,
that everyone furtively understands that

49
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:09,220
life is meaningless despite what they 
profess to believe in public,

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
and that a moderated submission to this 
chaos is in fact profoundly healthy.

51
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,650
Key word moderate cyberpunk allows us 
away into this part of ourselves.

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,370
It reflects loneliness,
the evasion of responsibility,

53
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,970
and the severe impotence of man in the 
mouth of the universe.

54
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:31,060
It makes chumps that of scientists and 
dogmatists alike,

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,223
and though it tears down the walls I've 
built to protect myself from the 

56
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,734
largeness of nihilism,
it's at the same time a feeling of 

57
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,420
loveliness as if I was listening to a 
gentle song

58
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,120
and when the note turned

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,443
had melted.

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,710
Thank you for staying with me through 40
