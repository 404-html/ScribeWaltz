1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,503
There is a certain natural phenomenon 
that you may or may not be familiar 

2
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:10,074
with,
a facial expression made by the human 

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,940
when one of its number is holding and 
reading a book.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,443
The head is slightly raised,
turned at 20 to 30 degrees from the 

5
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:25,950
forward eyes widen slowly.
Pupils dilate.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,813
Vision enhances this,
followed by a momentary paralysis in 

7
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,840
which a number of subjects have recorded
a feeling of quote,

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,620
loveliness.
Here it is in its closest approximation,

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,560
and here are some of the commonly sited 
causes.

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,423
What is that feeling when you're driving
away from people and they recede on the 

11
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,810
plane till you see their specs 
dispersing.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,980
It's the two huge world vaulting us and 
it's goodbye,

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,263
but we lean forward to the next crazy 
venture beneath the skies for a moment 

14
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:01,464
of phrase,
tried to take shape in my mouth and my 

15
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:06,450
lips parted like a dumb man's as though 
there was more struggling upon them than

16
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,284
a wisp of startled air,
but they made no sound and what I had 

17
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,020
almost remembered was incommunicable 
forever.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,273
A solemn consideration.
When I enter a great city by night that 

19
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,024
every one of those darkly clustered 
houses in closes its own secret that 

20
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,210
every room and every one of them 
encloses it's own secret,

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,130
that every beating heart in the hundreds
of thousands of breasts there is in some

22
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,000
of it's imagining,
so secret to the heart,

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,340
nearest it.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,530
There are more things in heaven and 
earth,

25
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,260
Horatio than are dreamt of in your 
philosophy.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,570
Maybe you know the feeling and if you 
do,

27
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,583
you could like I did produce a list of 
quotes that triggers the same natural 

28
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:44,934
phenomenon in you and knowing that you 
know that these words don't just knock 

29
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:48,684
us around intellectually,
but physically they twist us into knots 

30
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,614
or untie the tightest ones within us.
They put us face to face with our 

31
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,660
illusions are bigotries our 
preconceptions.

32
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,494
You know that to grasp just one sentence
of the very best writing is to grasp a 

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,120
thousand sentences of great writing,
which is to grasp 10,000

34
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,560
sentences of good.
Right?

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,800
And in this way,
great books are very expensive things.

36
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:14,310
They come at the cost of thousands and 
thousands of sentences.

37
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,144
They come at the cost of dozens of 
easier books and children's books and 

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
picture books and simple poems and sing 
along songs.

39
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:25,050
They come at the cost of a room to read 
room to read,

40
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:25,884
promotes literacy around the world by 
building libraries and getting kids 

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,280
access to books,
helping millions to put their very first

42
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
down payments on dickens or Shakespeare.
This is a phenomenon we should help 

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,630
everyone to feel

44
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,750
right.
