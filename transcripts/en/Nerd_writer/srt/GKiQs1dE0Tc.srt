1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,480
So there's a great scene near the 
beginning of shame,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,680
blacks,
the nice guys,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,420
which more people should have seen in 
theaters,

4
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,171
by the way,
you know what?

5
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,760
Fuck the angry birds.
Anyway,

6
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:12,180
we're Ryan gosling.
A private investigator breaks into a bar

7
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,014
to get his hands on some receipts like 
we've seen people do a million times 

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:16,764
before in movies.
Gosling is going to break the glass to 

9
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:23,241
unlock the door from inside,
but things really don't go as planned.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,013
Besides being a hilariously funny 
reversal and subversion of an old 

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,570
cliche,
I think this moment gets to the heart of

12
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:37,380
Shane.
Blacks interests in awkward violence and

13
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,880
deeper than that in film,
new wars,

14
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,140
obsession with violence as the undying 
backdrop to civilization.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,573
Speaking of backdrops,
you made not be familiar with Shane 

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
Black,
but his work has been in the backdrop of

17
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:49,434
Hollywood for 30 years now,
starting as a writer during the SPEC 

18
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,330
script boom of the late eighties,
nineties,

19
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:58,200
and early two thousands when unsolicited
original scripts were really high.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,340
Demand Black wrote lethal weapon one end
to the last boy scout,

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,233
long kiss goodnight.
Then went on to direct his written work 

22
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:06,120
in films like kiss,
Kiss,

23
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:06,680
Bang,
Bang,

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,220
iron man three,
and finally the Nice guys.

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,133
All of these films share similar themes,
so I'll have fractured characters all 

26
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,150
take place in dangerous,
often.

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,970
See me.
Worlds all have whipped fast plots,

28
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,260
reversals,
betrayals,

29
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,360
and plenty of character revealing 
banter.

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,230
In other words,
they all share the traits of film noir.

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,153
There's a certain madness,
I think in a certain bizarre quality of 

32
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,490
violence in the war films where it's 
devastating.

33
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,460
It's just ongoing.
It's not just clever.

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,660
It's devastating.

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,810
At this point,
we're clearly not lacking in violence at

36
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,644
the movies.
Blockbuster and tent pole films are a 

37
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,100
wash in this stuff.
Explosions,

38
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,570
car crashes,
chases,

39
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,890
fights,
you name it.

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,400
There are some directors and stunt 
coordinators who are really good at it.

41
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,234
For example,
the Captain America Franchise I think 

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,783
has mastered a very sharp part hitting 
type of superhero violence where other 

43
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:03,000
franchises have struggled to meet that 
bar,

44
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,360
but the thing about violence in 
superhero films is that it's fun,

45
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,223
but never really that consequential,
particularly if it's heroes fighting 

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
heroes come on,
black widow,

47
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,010
you know these people are slated until 
like 20,

48
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:14,844
22,
right?

49
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,403
A lot of these films add violence to the
mix to spice up things every 20 minutes 

50
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,144
or so,
they write themselves up to the brink 

51
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,690
and then let the stunt coordinators take
it from there,

52
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,940
making sure a few beats or hit along the
way.

53
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,520
This isn't necessarily bad.
Sometimes it's awesome,

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,413
but it's not all that violence can do.
The question you should be asking isn't 

55
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,110
where you should add violence,
but how can you use it?

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,300
Take that scene from the beginning.
With gosling,

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,030
it accomplishes so much in such a short 
period of time.

58
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,130
It subverts that cliche for comedic 
effect.

59
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,470
It's a quick reversal of narrative 
momentum.

60
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,140
It shows how hapless gosling's character
is,

61
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,173
and an accidental slitting of the risk 
plays into the deeper sadness that 

62
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
underlies his drunkenness.
I kind of 40 and slit shane black is a 

63
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:02,110
master at using violence to augment 
story and character in his action.

64
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,280
Thrillers and neo wars want to show that
a police detective his past his prime.

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,103
What if you want to show that a 
detective craves violence in an almost 

66
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
masochistic way in blacks films,
the violence is often messy and shocking

67
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,630
and awkward because that's what real 
violence is like.

68
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,090
It's a kind of chaos,
a rupture in things.

69
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,780
The inciting incident in a long kiss 
goodnight is a perfect example of this.

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,793
Gina Davis hits a deer with her car,
which would be enough to send the car 

71
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:30,784
careening off the road by itself,
but black has the deer come through the 

72
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,310
windshield,
still alive,

73
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,900
kicking the passenger in the face.
This is awkward and transfixing in a way

74
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,110
that leaves us on guarded against the 
violence of the moment.

75
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,363
In consequence,
we become more present for the whole 

76
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,630
scene.
The pencil trick in the dark night,

77
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,640
by the way,
achieves a similar effect.

78
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:55,540
Another thing black likes to do is visit
violence on an otherwise piece.

79
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,570
The thing that black likes to do is 
visit.

80
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,780
Maybe

81
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,970
I should just let black say it in his 
own words,

82
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,893
in this country where we think 
everything's settled and stable and 

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,983
serene,
something horribly violent can intrude 

84
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,424
upon our piece and then we have to go 
back to this gunslinger who knew all 

85
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,450
along that the war wasn't over in the 
west,

86
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:23,284
wasn't gentrified,
black uses sudden violence not only to 

87
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,284
shock the audience,
but as a way to justify an animate his 

88
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,254
heroes and heroines.
The point is that this is violence with 

89
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,190
narrative purpose.
That purpose may be as simple as keeping

90
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:41,191
the audience on their toes or fingers,
finger,

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,693
yeah,
it may be a way to solve a simple 

92
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,234
problem or it might reveal what a 
character's really like or who he would 

93
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:59,401
like to be.
Just we all live around violence,

94
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:04,651
but by and large were separate from it.
A good new or thriller lets us travel to

95
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,150
the other side,
dip our feet into that current,

96
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,860
feel,
how cold it is,

97
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,010
if we've had the bad fortune to 
experience it firsthand,

98
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,903
we know that violence can be 
indiscriminate and deeply personal at 

99
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,480
the same time,
violence done right in these movies.

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Violence as a plot element or an 
exhibition of character.

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,570
Awkward violence is violence,
respected.

102
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,920
Of course,
at the end of the day,

103
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,510
these are just movies,
pulpy,

104
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,280
detective stories,
genre flicks,

105
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,683
but I wouldn't want to live in a 
universe that didn't have pulpy genre 

106
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,720
detective movies like lethal weapon or 
kiss,

107
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,350
kiss,
Bang,

108
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,183
Bang.
I think Shane Black is one of the few 

109
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:45,250
action thriller writers who incorporates
violence into his scripts creatively and

110
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm glad he's still getting work for 
that to keep happening.

111
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,980
Of course we have to keep going to see 
his movies and it.

112
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,510
Unless that is your okay with the 
alternative

113
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,030
to the birds.

114
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,640
