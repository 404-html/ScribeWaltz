1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,290
Coffee on a Tuesday and block 16.

2
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,270
I should start by saying I'm more of an 
atheist than it is.

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,383
In other words,
my view is not just that there is no 

4
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,570
reason to believe that there is a deity 
and that all the arguments that there is

5
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:34,110
one have long since been exploded by 
philosophers,

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,470
astronomers,
scientists,

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,150
physicists,
biologists and so forth.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,710
Um,
mainly by philosophers,

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,563
the,
my opinion,

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,823
um,
but that it's a good thing that that's 

11
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:44,994
not okay.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,460
How do we describe Christopher Hitchens 
as a writer,

13
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,151
journalist,
teacher,

14
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:50,230
political commentator,
contrarion atheists,

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,100
extremely adept debater as a champion of
truth,

16
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,080
democracy,
whiskey,

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,430
and a piece of advice his mother gave 
him when he was just a young boy,

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,620
that the only unforgivable sin is to be 
born.

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,503
Yvonne's advice was never forgot.
It became one of the most successful at 

20
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,040
penetrating thinkers of his time.
Publishing several books,

21
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,350
tearing down sacred cows from Mother 
Teresa.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,610
Fanatical Albanian

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,160
dwarf lying.
Thieving of Bill Clinton.

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,580
No,
I think he is even by,

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,783
even by the most relaxed standard,
an unusually hollow and empty and cold 

26
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,520
individually and completely ruthless.
Henry Kissinger,

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,393
criminal is Henry [inaudible].
Job description on has been since you 

28
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,330
first caught Richard Nixon's.
Yeah,

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,213
I had.
The one and only got the Christian 

30
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:30,580
answer is,
of course you have freewill.

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,590
The boss insists upon it.
You lionized Jefferson,

32
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:36,640
Orwell,
Thomas Paine.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,830
He wrote columns for Vanity Fair,
slate magazine,

34
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:39,664
the Atlantic.
He was a prolific and viber and inhaler 

35
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,820
two things which no doubt shortened his 
life in the end,

36
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:46,270
but he was too smart not to know that 
you get out of alcohol,

37
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:49,150
what you put into it,
and as he was a scotch man like me and a

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,043
Johnny Walker man like me,
I can only say simply everything in 

39
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,974
moderation.

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,000
Take two.
And as he was a scotch man like me and a

41
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,760
Johnny Walker man like me,
I can only say three.

42
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,970
Take for everything in moderation.
Takes Breakfast of champions.

43
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,490
League is work for yourself.
Agree with him or done.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,140
My Point is not to vindicate his.
To me.

45
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,310
Christopher hitchens represents 
something.

46
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:20,030
The world is always in short supply of 
men and women of letters,

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,953
intellectual,
one apologetic for being so sometime in 

48
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:23,594
the last couple of centuries,
intellectuals lost their credit and the 

49
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:25,814
western world and just when they were 
doing so good in the enlightenment in 

50
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:28,664
our time,
the word intellectual has come to be 

51
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,900
synonymous with pretend anti 
intellectualism isn't old and repetitive

52
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,580
story.
It made itself a home in Mussolini's,

53
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:35,810
Italy,
Stalin's Russia,

54
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:36,644
Hitler's Germany,
where you can trace it back in time 

55
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:38,594
through religion all the way to the 
death of socrates or you can move 

56
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:42,860
forward in time to the populist.
Politicians like George W,

57
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,230
but I like to mountain bike.
I liked country music on my ipod

58
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,383
strategy.
We're intellectuals are pitted against 

59
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,930
the uncorrupt salt of the earth.
Good to have a beer with folk like this.

60
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,630
Anti intellectual wisdom is troubling in
all its manifestations,

61
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,910
but maybe nowhere more so than in youth 
court.

62
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,070
They

63
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,730
are impressionable and they have the 
cash.

64
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,140
They are corporate America's $150 
million dollar dream.

65
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,153
The idea here is that the advertising 
industry has transformed the language 

66
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,900
thought and actions of teenagers into 
commodities.

67
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,350
In order to sell them popularity,
creating a generation who was completely

68
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,570
uninterested in maturing to adult,
but take this how you want.

69
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:22,900
There is certainly a good point here,
but what I saw in myself and others as a

70
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,990
young teenager was that being an idiot 
is ease.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,833
It's amazing when you're an idiot.
Everything that comes out of your mouth 

72
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,330
is idiotic with no work at all,
but when you want to be intelligent,

73
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,980
everything you say requires a little 
work,

74
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,710
a little bit of thought and effort to 
compose yourself,

75
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,380
so it's not to be inane or contradictory
or redundant,

76
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,880
doesn't mean that intellectuals can't be
silly.

77
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,730
It doesn't mean that we can't turn our 
brains off every once in a while.

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,840
We all need them.

79
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,540
Well being an intellectual,
no matter how you slice it is hard.

80
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,403
It takes introspection and time and a 
willingness to be critical of yourself 

81
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,020
and it never stops being hard.
It gets harder.

82
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,420
The reward is that hard work becomes the
reward.

83
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,340
Learning becomes a commodity as bright 
and infinitely renewable as the sun.

84
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,210
Everyone can and should be an 
intellectual,

85
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,720
whether you're a doctor or a plumber or 
a president or a germ.

86
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,790
All it takes is putting yourself on the 
record.

87
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,624
It takes writing something and 
submitting it to the public for if 

88
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,540
you're a painter,
lawyer,

89
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,410
filmmaker,
dancer,

90
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,080
that's great,
but still right,

91
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,070
musician,
engineer,

92
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,100
diplomat,
accountant.

93
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,950
Fantastic.
What still words or the units of thought

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,860
and if you listen to anything I say,
let it be this.

95
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,880
We learn by saying,
not think ideas are like clouds.

96
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,920
You can't hold onto when we compose a 
sentence,

97
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,754
we make the idea of solid.
Then we can put it in our pockets and 

98
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,540
take it with us.

99
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,430
What do you think it takes to lead a 
good life?

100
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,620
For me,
I'm irony.

101
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,323
I'm literature as the source of 
reflection on moral and ethical and 

102
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,424
human topics.
I'm laughing at the misfortunes of 

103
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,810
others that gets me through it all.
Um,

104
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,110
I love,
uh,

105
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,340
and some of the things that go with,
um,

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,400
the possibility of passing on your genes
to children,

107
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,950
the,
any kind of immortality or whatever.

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,440
And did I mention this already?
Laughing at the misfortune of others.

109
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,720
And it will be improved,
right?

110
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,783
I'm being vindicated in arguments that 
other people wish they hadn't had with 

111
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,690
you.
They have to say,

112
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,620
okay,
I was Roman.

113
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:19,454
You are right.
